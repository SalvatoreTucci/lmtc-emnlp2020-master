The production aid may not exceed the difference between the minimum price paid to the producer  in the Community and the price of the raw material in the main producing and exporting third  countries.\n3.  The price of the raw material in the main competing third countries shall be determined mainly  on the basis of the prices:\n- actually applying at the farm-gate stage for fresh products of a comparable quality used for  processing,\n- weighted on the basis of the quantities of finished products exported by those third countries to  the world market.\n4.  For products for which Community production accounts for at least 50 % of the quantities for  consumption on the Community market, the aid may be reduced by the trend in prices and in the  quantities of imports and exports, which shall be determined by comparing the data for the calendar  year preceding the beginning of the marketing year with the data for the previous calendar year.\n5.  The minimum price for the raw material to be used for dried grapes and dried figs shall be the  minimum price to be paid to the producer at the beginning of the marketing year, plus the average  of the monthly increases provided for in Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86.", "When strictly necessary, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedure laid down  in Article 22 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 426/86, establish a system of monetary adjustment with the aim  of correcting the production aid by the impact on the minimum price minus the aid, of the  differences between:\n- the agricultural conversion rate, and\n- the average of the rates referred to in Article 3 (1) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 (1) during a period to be determined.", "The factors referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 shall be  calculated on the basis of the average quantities of raw material used and the net weight of  finished products obtained in the Community during the 1987/88, 1988/89 and 1989/90 marketing  years.
