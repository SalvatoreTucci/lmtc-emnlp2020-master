Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136) was provisionally authorised for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005\u00a0(3). It was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004\u00a0(4), for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005\u00a0(5), for pigs for fattening and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 516/2007\u00a0(6) and for 10 years for ducks by Commission Regulation (EC) No 242/2007\u00a0(7). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation for laying hens. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI SD 135) was provisionally authorised for laying hens, pigs for fattening and weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/1998\u00a0(8). It was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2148/2004\u00a0(9), for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 828/2007\u00a0(10). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation for laying hens and weaned piglets. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Penicillium funiculosum (IMI SD 101) was provisionally authorised for piglets (weaned) and ducks for fattening by Regulation (EC) No 2148/2004. It was authorised for chickens for fattening without a time limit by Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004, for laying hens and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005\u00a0(11) and for pigs for fattening by Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation for ducks for fattening and weaned piglets. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex III, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0270, 14.12.1970, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a057, 2.3.2005, p.\u00a03.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0239, 9.7.2004, p.\u00a08.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0197, 28.7.2005, p.\u00a012.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0122, 11.5.2007, p.\u00a022.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a073, 13.3.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0191, 7.7.1998, p.\u00a015.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0370, 17.12.2004, p.\u00a024.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0184, 14.7.2007, p.\u00a012.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0159, 22.6.2005, p.\u00a06.\nANNEX I\nEC No Additive Chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff\nEnzymes\n1.
