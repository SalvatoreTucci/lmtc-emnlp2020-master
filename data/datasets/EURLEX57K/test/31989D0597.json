Consequently, pursuant to Article 10 of the Decision, the Commission must determine whether the measures are compatible with the objectives and criteria laid down in the Decision and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII\nRestructuring coal production in France has brought about a marked improvement in productivity and production costs.\nOver the last few years the amount of aid granted to the coal industry in France has been reduced appreciably. The aid covered by this Decision is almost 58 % down on 1986.\nAid to cover operating losses allows the coal industry restructuring programme to continue and helps to improve the industry's competitiveness in the long term.\nThe proposed aid will cover only 41 % of the cost of each tonne produced in each mine, and the difference between foreseeable average costs and foreseeable average returns corresponds with the criteria in Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nSince the measure is on a declining scale and contributes to the restructuring of the industry, it satisfies the objectives and conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Decision.\nIn the light of the foregoing, the aid which the French Government plans to grant to the French coal industry for current production in 1989 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision applies without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of arrangements or agreements governing sales of coal mined in France to electricity producers.\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof. The Commission must therefore be informed of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The French Government is hereby authorized to grant for 1989 aid totalling FF 1 229 000 000 to cover operating losses.", "The French Government shall inform the Commission by 30 June 1990 of the amounts actually paid in 1989.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 September 1989.\nFor the Commission\nAnt\u0e23\u0e13nio CARDOSO E CUNHA\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1."}
