By letter dated 3 July 2009, the Commission notified the Republic of Poland that it had all the information it considered necessary to appraise the request.\n(3) Title XII, Chapter 1 of Directive 2006/112/EC provides for the possibility of Member States applying special schemes for small enterprises, including an optional VAT exemption scheme for taxable persons whose annual turnover is below a certain ceiling.\n(4) Under Article 287(14) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Poland may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR\u00a010\u00a0000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession.\n(5) By increasing this ceiling to EUR\u00a030\u00a0000, the Republic of Poland will be able to simplify administrative procedures for a larger proportion of small enterprises, while confining itself to those enterprises with the lowest turnover, and thus contributing to their development.\n(6) In its proposal for a Directive simplifying value added tax obligations of 29 October 2004, the Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR\u00a0100\u00a0000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating this amount each year. The request submitted by the Republic of Poland is in line with this proposal.\n(7) The derogation presented will have no impact on the European Communities\u2019 own resources accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 287 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Republic of Poland is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than the equivalent in national currency of EUR\u00a030\u00a0000 at the conversion rate on the day of its accession.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2010 until the date of entry into force of the provisions of a directive amending the amounts of the annual turnover ceilings below which taxable persons may qualify for VAT exemption or until 31 December 2012, whichever is the earlier date.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
