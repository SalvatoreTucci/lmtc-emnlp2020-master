That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) as a feed additive for sows to be used for the duration of the entire reproductive cycle, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 was authorised provisionally for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 666/2003\u00a0(2), provisionally for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003\u00a0(3), provisionally for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(4), for 10\u00a0years for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 538/2007\u00a0(5) and for 10\u00a0years for sows from day 90 of pregnancy to the end of lactation by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01521/2007\u00a0(6).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 18 February 2014\u00a0(7) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It also concluded that the additive has the potential to increase litter weight gain or maintain sow condition. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) As a consequence of the authorisation being granted by this Implementing Regulation, Regulation (EC) No\u00a01521/2007 should be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019 is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in this Annex.", "Regulation (EC) No 1521/2007 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 666/2003 of 11 April 2003 provisionally authorising the use of certain micro-organisms in feedingstuffs (OJ L\u00a096, 12.4.2003, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003 of 10 December 2003 provisionally authorising certain micro-organisms in feedingstuffs (Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus) (OJ L\u00a0324, 11.12.2003, p.\u00a011).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 of 1 April 2005 concerning the permanent authorisation of an additive and the provisional authorisation of new uses of certain additives already authorised in feedingstuffs (OJ L\u00a084, 2.4.2005, p.\u00a03).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 538/2007 of 15 May 2007 concerning the authorisation of a new use of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) as a feed additive (OJ L\u00a0128, 16.5.2007, p.\u00a016).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1521/2007 of 19 December 2007 concerning the authorisation of a new use of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) as a feed additive (OJ L\u00a0335, 20.12.2007, p.\u00a024).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(2):3565\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
