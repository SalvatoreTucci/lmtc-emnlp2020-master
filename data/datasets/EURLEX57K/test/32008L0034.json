Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2002/96/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Since the Commission has laid down the detailed rules referred to in Article 7(3) of Directive 2002/96/EC by means of Decision 2005/369/EC\u00a0(6), it is appropriate to delete the reference to the deadline of 13 August 2004.\n(6) Directive 2002/96/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since the amendments made to Directive 2002/96/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
