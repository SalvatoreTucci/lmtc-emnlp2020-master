It is therefore not necessary to refer to Article 13(3) (a) and (b) when specifying the procedure of attesting the conformity according to Article 13(4). The text of Decision 97/464/EC should be simplified by deleting this reference.\n(3) Following a review of waste water engineering product families, and the need to accommodate the regulatory needs of the Member States in respect of reaction to fire, the procedures of attestation of conformity in respect of reaction to fire characteristics should be added.\n(4) Following a review of the product family \u2018Waste water engineering products outside buildings (3/3)\u2019 a higher level of safety for manhole tops and gully tops for use in vehicular and pedestrian areas should be assured.\n(5) Decision 97/464/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction.", "main_body": ["Decision 97/464/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
