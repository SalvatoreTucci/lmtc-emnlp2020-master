The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex I to the imports, expressed in volume terms, of each importer over the reference period.\n(5) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex II to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 637/2002,", "main_body": ["In response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex I duly submitted by traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity equal to its imports for 1998 or 1999, adjusted by the rate of reduction specified in the said Annex for each quota.\nWhere the use of this quantitative criterion would entail allocating an amount greater than that applied for, the quantity allocated shall be limited to that specified in the application.", "In response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex II duly submitted by non-traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity equal to the amount requested within the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 637/2002 adjusted by the rate of reduction specified in the said Annex for each quota.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 July 2002.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 89.\n(2) OJ L 159, 3.6.1998, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 66, 10.3.1994, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 21, 27.1.1996, p. 6.\n(5) OJ L 96, 13.4.2002, p. 8.\nANNEX I\nRate of reduction (-) applicable to the imports of 1998 or 1999 (traditional importers)\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\nRate of reduction (-) applicable to the volume requested within the limits of the maximum amounts fixed by Regulation (EC) No 637/2002 (non-traditional importers)\n>TABLE>"}
