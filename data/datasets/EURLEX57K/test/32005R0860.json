The outcome of the consultations has to be incorporated in Regulation (EC) No 27/2005.\n(5) The Greenland authorities have notified the Commission that the Community has access to 1\u00a0000 tonnes of snow crab in Greenland waters. It has further been agreed with the Greenland authorities that the whole quota of redfish in areas V and XIV may be fished by pelagic trawl.\n(6) It has appeared that allocating more days of fishing per calendar month in the North Sea to vessels fishing with towed gears with 120 mm square mesh windows could jeopardise the recovery of cod and would be contrary to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004. The North Sea should therefore be deleted from the list of areas to which that allocation of supplemental days is applicable. It is equally appropriate to clarify the technical specifications of the 120\u00a0mm square mesh window.\n(7) The fishing opportunities for deep-sea sharks in ICES sub-area X (Community waters and international waters) should be increased to 120 tonnes thereby allowing deep-sea sharks that are taken as unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries to be landed.\n(8) The rules on the interactions of fishing between areas defined in Annex IVa and Annex IVc to Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 should not prevent a vessel from using the maximum number of days available in Annex IVa. Those rules should therefore be amended.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004\u00a0(5) fixes for 2005 and 2006 the fishing opportunities for Community fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks.\n(10) The fishing opportunities for roundnose grenadier in ICES division Vb, sub-areas VI and VII (Community waters and international waters) were inappropriately calculated in Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 and should be corrected.\n(11) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries as soon as possible. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 27/2005 and (EC) No 2270/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 27/2005\nRegulation (EC) No 27/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.
