It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, on 5 April 2011.\n(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of methiocarb on 1 June 2012\u00a0(5). The draft assessment report, the addendum and the opinion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 13 December 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for methiocarb.\n(6) In the light of the additional information provided by the notifier, the Commission considered that the further confirmatory information required had not been provided.\n(7) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for methiocarb.\n(8) The Commission has come to the conclusion that a high risk for birds, mammals and non-target arthropods cannot be excluded, even when further risk mitigation measures were to be imposed.\n(9) It is confirmed that the active substance methiocarb is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. In order to preclude the exposure of birds, mammals and non-target arthropods, it is appropriate to further restrict the uses of this active substance and to withdraw the use as a moluscicide.\n(10) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing methiocarb.\n(12) For plant protection products containing methiocarb, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing methiocarb as active substance by 19 September 2014.", "Grace period\nAny grace period granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 19 September 2015 at the latest.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2007/5/EC of 7 February 2007 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include captan, folpet, formetanate and methiocarb as active substances (OJ L 35, 8.2.2007, p. 11).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of confirmatory data submitted for the active substance methiocarb.
