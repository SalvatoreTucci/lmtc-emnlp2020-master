Winsl. et al. until 31 March 2010.\n(3) Following observations regarding the presence of that harmful organism in certain parts of the Veneto region made by the Commission during an inspection in Italy from 31 August to 11 September 2009, Italy informed the Commission on 23 October 2009 of the results of the latest survey carried out in the Veneto region for the presence of that harmful organism in September and October 2009. The results of this latest survey show that in the province of Venice there are 14 places, in which that harmful organism has been occurring for a period of at least the last three successive years in spite of the eradication measures taken by the Italian authorities. Consequently, those measures have proved to be ineffective.\n(4) The latest survey results were discussed during the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 19-20 October 2009. It was concluded that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. has to be considered as established in the province of Venice. That province should therefore no longer be included in the lists in Annexes II, III and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(5) From the Swiss legislation on plant protection, it appears that the Cantons of Fribourg and Vaud are no longer recognised as a protected zone for Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. in Switzerland as of 15 November 2009. The derogation allowing certain imports from those regions into certain protected zones under special requirements should therefore be deleted and Part B of Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) Annexes II, III and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\nMember States shall adopt and publish, by 28 February 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
