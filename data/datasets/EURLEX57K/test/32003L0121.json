Commission Directive 98/53/EC(4), as amended by Directive 2002/27/EC(5), should be amended to include specific provisions for maize to be subjected to sorting, or other physical treatment, before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.\n(3) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach across the Union. These interpretation rules should be of application for the analytical result obtained on the sample for official control. In case of analysis for defence or referee purposes, the national rules apply.\n(4) Directive 98/53/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/53/EC is amended as set out in Annex I to this Directive.\nAnnex II to Directive 98/53/EC is amended as set out in Annex II to this Directive.", "1.

In cases where the aggregate sample weights are under 10 kg, the aggregate sample must not be divided into three subsamples. In the case of spices the aggregate sample weighs not more than 10 kg and therefore no division in subsamples is necessary.\";\n2. point 5.2.2 is replaced by the following:\n\"5.2.2. Acceptance of a lot or sublot\n- For groundnuts, nuts, dried fruit and maize subjected to a sorting or other physical treatment and spices:\n- acceptance if the aggregate sample or the average of the subsamples conforms to the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if the aggregate sample or the average of the subsamples exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.\n- For groundnuts, nuts, dried fruit and cereals intended for direct human consumption and cereals, with the exception of maize, to be subjected to a sorting or other physical treatment:\n- acceptance if none of the subsamples exceeds the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if one or more of the subsamples exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- where the aggregate sample is under 10 kg:\n- acceptance if the aggregate sample conforms to the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if the aggregate sample exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account analytical uncertainty and correction for recovery.\";\n3. point 5.4.2 is replaced by the following:\n\"5.4.2. Acceptance of a lot or sublot\n- acceptance if the aggregate sample conforms to the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if the aggregate sample exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.\";\n4. point 5.5.1.2 is replaced by the following:\n\"5.5.1.2. Acceptance of a lot or sublot\n- acceptance if the aggregate sample conforms to the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if the aggregate sample exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.\";\n5. point 5.5.2.3 is replaced by the following:\n\"5.5.2.3. Acceptance of a lot or sublot\n- acceptance if the aggregate sample conforms to the maximum limit, taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery,\n- rejection if the aggregate sample exceeds the maximum limit beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.\"\nANNEX II\nIn Annex II to Directive 98/53/EC, point 4.4 is replaced by the following:\n\"4.4. Recovery calculation and reporting of results\nThe analytical result is to be reported corrected or uncorrected for recovery. The manner of reporting and the level of recovery must be reported. The analytical result corrected for recovery is used for checking compliance (see Annex I, points 5.2.2, 5.3.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.1.2 and 5.5.2.3).\nThe analytical result has to be reported as x +/- U whereby x is the analytical result and U is the expanded measurement uncertainty, using a coverage factor of 2 which gives a level of confidence of approximately 95 %.\""}
