that some production units had had to be provisionally closed during this period, causing 1 124 people to be made redundant; that Spanish producers's sales had fallen over the same period to 192 000 tonnes, which, on a monthly basis, was a 20 % reduction compared with the sales figure for 1985 (441 000 tonnes); whereas, on the other hand, the stocks of the producers concerned had increased from 38 000 tonnes at the end of 1985 to 54 200 tonnes on 30 June 1986; whereas the effect of import prices (Pta 13,71 per kilogram on average) had been to force Spanish producers to reduce their sales prices from Pta 33,4 per kilogram (1985) to Pta 28,8 per kilogram in the first six months of 1986; whereas this fall in prices, combined with the decrease in Spanish producers' sales, inevitably had a negative effect on producers' profits and the return on capital;\nWhereas, as regards the threat of injury, they pointed out that the data gathered under the national surveillance system showed quite clearly that this increase in imports could only grow bigger, since from 7 to 30 July 1986 the businessmen concerned had notified them of their intention to import 45 752 tonnes at even lower prices than those applied in the first six months, and that this further increase in imports on these terms would inevitably make the situation worse and might, moreover, put an end to the Spanish Government's plan for reorganizing the sector;\nWhereas the data supplied by the Spanish Government have been substantially borne out by the preliminary results of the Community investigation;\nWhereas, in view of the critical nature of the situation of the Spanish industry, pending the results of the current Community investigation and as a provisional measure applicable until 31 October 1986, imports into Spain of urea originating in the third countries covered by this Regulation should be limited from now on; whereas it is\nonly by adopting measures that it will be possible to avoid any injury which it would be difficult to remedy; whereas the critical circumstances do not permit the exclusion of imports of urea originating in third countries with which the Community has a free trade arrangement;\nWhereas, in view of the situation of the Spanish market, the volume of imports since 1 January 1986 and those originating in other Member States which will be authorized, imports should be limited to 15 000 tonnes;\nWhereas in view of the serious nature of the situation the protective measures must be applied even in the case of current contractual relations; whereas in order to avoid further injury to the businessmen concerned, this measure must not affect goods already consigned; whereas, however, it should be possible for the Spanish authorities to take into consideration the total volume of these consignments when allocating the quantities fixed pursuant to this Regulation;\nWhereas the Community investigation should be pursued before making an overall evaluation of the situation and deciding, in the light of all the relevant factors, whether or not it is in the interests of the Community to amend the arrangements applicable to imports to Spain of urea originating in countries covered by Regulation (EEC) No 288/82,", "main_body": ["Imports into Spain of urea (NIMEXE code 31.02-15) originating in the third countries covered by Regulation (EEC) No 288/82 shall be limited, until 31 October 1986, on the conditions given below, to 15 000 tonnes.", "This Regulation shall not preclude imports into Spain of urea originating in third countries which, at the time of its entry into force, are being shipped to Spain, provided that they cannot be sent to another destination, and that they are accompanied by the import document referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 288/82 issued by the Spanish authorities.", "The Spanish authorities may deduct from the limits fixed in implementation of this Regulation the total volume of goods imported pursuant to Article 2.", "On the fifth day of each month the Spanish authorities shall communicate data for the previous month relating to imports originating in all third countries.
