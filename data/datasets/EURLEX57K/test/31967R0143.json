whereas this is also true of the products listed in Article 1 (2) (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, with the exception of oils falling within heading No ex 15.07 of the Common Customs Tariff, because of the special situation of the market and certain technical difficulties involved in fixing the compensatory amount ; whereas the levy on imports of olive oil and certain products containing olive oil is providing sufficient protection for the moment against imports fulfilling the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 3 (6) of that Regulation ; whereas it would therefore be sufficient at present to determine conditions for applying that subparagraph solely in respect of vegetable oils other than olive oil;\nWhereas, when practices which might lead to the charging of a compensatory amount are being reviewed, a distinction should be made between direct and indirect subsidies or premiums for oils which reduce the prices of these products on importation into the Community and measures applicable to oil seeds and oleaginous fruit which have an equivalent effect as far as oil producers within the Community are concerned;\nWhereas observance of international commitments undertaken by the Community and Member States makes in necessary to ensure that the compensatory amount does not exceed either the estimated amount of subsidies and premiums or the incidence of measures having equivalent effect;\nWhereas the charging of the compensatory amount may affect the competitive position of industries using the oils to which this measure applies ; whereas provision should therefore be made for the possibility of making exceptions in respect of oils intended for certain non-food uses;", "main_body": ["The compensatory amount referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 3 (6) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC may be fixed, subject to other conditions laid down in that subparagraph, in respect of imports of oils falling within heading No ex 15.07 of the Common Customs Tariff, with the exception of olive oil, if the prices of these oils on importation into the Community:  (a) are lower than the prices which would be established for these products in the absence of subsidies or premiums for the production, manufacture, exportation or transport of oils granted directly or indirectly by the exporting country or the country of origin, irrespective of the grounds for, nature of or manner of granting these subsidies or premiums;
