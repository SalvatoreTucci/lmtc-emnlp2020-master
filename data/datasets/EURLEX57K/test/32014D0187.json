That list is set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(2) Following communication from Spain and Portugal, the entries for the border inspection posts at Madrid and Tenerife Sur airports in Spain and at Porto airport and at Ponta Delgada port and airport in Portugal should be amended in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(3) Council Decision 2011/408/EU\u00a0(5) lays down simplified rules and procedures for the application of sanitary controls for fishery products, bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and to by-products thereof and products derived from these by-products originating from Greenland or introduced into Greenland from third countries and thereafter imported from Greenland into the Union. Article 5 of that Decision details the requirements for veterinary checks on these products in border inspection posts and that the list of border inspection posts approved in Greenland shall be included in the list of border inspection posts in the Member States approved in accordance with Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC.\n(4) The Commission audit service (formerly referred to as Commission inspection service), the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), has carried out an audit to two proposed border inspection posts in Greenland, following which it made some recommendations to that country. These recommendations were satisfactorily addressed by Greenland with an action plan and the two proposed border inspection posts should be added to the list in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(5) As the simplified rules and procedures for import controls are only applicable for certain products, a footnote determining fishery products, bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and to by-products thereof and products derived from these by-products should be added to the special remarks in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(6) An audit of the FVO was carried out at border inspection posts in Italy in November 2011, following which a number of recommendations were made to that Member State. These recommendations were satisfactorily addressed by Italy with an action plan and with the amendment of the approval categories of the border inspection posts at the ports of Livorno-Pisa, Trieste and Venezia, which should therefore be amended accordingly in the list in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC for that Member State.\n(7) The Netherlands have communicated that a new inspection centre has been added to the border inspection post\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam. The list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision\u00a02009/821/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) Annex II to Decision 2009/821/EC lays down the list of central units, regional units and local units in the integrated computerised veterinary system (Traces).\n(9) In accordance with European Council Decision 2012/419/EU\u00a0(6), Mayotte has ceased to be an overseas country or territory and became an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with effect from 1 January 2014. The entries for local units for France in Annex II to Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 24.9.1991, p.\u00a056.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2009/821/EC of 28 September 2009 drawing up a list of approved border inspection posts, laying down certain rules on the inspections carried out by Commission veterinary experts and laying down the veterinary units in Traces (OJ L\u00a0296, 12.11.2009, p.\u00a01).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Council Decision 2011/408/EU of 28 June 2011 laying down simplified rules and procedures on sanitary controls of fishery products, live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods, by-products thereof and products derived from these by-products coming from Greenland (OJ L\u00a0182, 12.7.2011, p.\u00a024).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0European Council Decision 2012/419/EU of 11 July 2012 amending the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union (OJ L\u00a0204, 31.7.2012, p.\u00a0131).\nANNEX\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) the following note (15) is added to the special remarks:\n(b) the part concerning Spain is amended as follows:\n(i) the entry for the airport at Madrid is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Madrid ES MAD 4 A Iberia HC-T(FR)(2)(*), HC-NT(2)(*), NHC(2) U, E, O\nSwissport HC(2), NHC-T(CH)(2), NHC-NT(2) O\nPER4 HC-T(CH)(2)\nWFS: World Wide Flight Services HC(2), NHC-T(CH)(2), NHC-NT O\u2019\n(ii) the entry for the airport at Tenerife Sur is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Tenerife Sur ES TFS 4 A Productos HC(2), NHC(2)\nAnimales  U(*), E(*), O\u2019\n(c) in the part after France, the following part for Greenland has to be added:\nNuuk GL GOH 1 P  HC(1)(2)(15), NHC-T(2)(15)\nSisimiut GL JHS 1 P  HC-T(FR)(1)(2)(15)\u2019\n(d) the part concerning Italy is amended as follows:\n(i) the entry for the port at Livorno-Pisa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Livorno-Pisa IT LIV 1 P Porto Commerciale HC-T(FR), NHC-NT\nSintemar(*) HC(*), NHC(*)\nLorenzini HC, NHC-NT\nTerminal Darsena Toscana HC, NHC\u2019\n(ii) the entry for the port at Trieste is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Trieste IT TRS 1 P Hangar 69 HC, NHC-NT, NHC-T(CH)\u2019\n(iii) the entry for the port at Venezia is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Venezia IT VCE 1 P  HC, NHC\u2019\n(e) in the part concerning the Netherlands, the entry for the port at Rotterdam is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Rotterdam NL RTM 1 P Eurofrigo Karimatastraat HC, NHC-T(FR), NHC-NT\nEurofrigo, Abel Tasmanstraat HC\nFrigocare Rotterdam B.V.
