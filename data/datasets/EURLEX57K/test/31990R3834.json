whereas they should therefore benefit, on a transitional basis, from the  system of generalized preferences in order to increase their export earnings with a view to  stimulating their economic development, to promote their industrialization and to accelerate their  rate of growth;\nWhereas, on 8  November 1990, the Commission recommended to the Council that it authorize it to  negotiate European Agreements with those three countries providing for the progressive  establishment of a free-trade area; whereas, this being the case, those countries should benefit  from the generalized preferential arrangements in 1991 until tariff concessions are granted under  those Agreements;\nWhereas the economic situation of Bulgaria is similar to that of the three aforementioned  countries; whereas it should therefore also benefit from the preferential arrangements in 1991;\nWhereas the situation in Romania justifies treatment identical to that granted to the four  countries referred to above; whereas equivalent preferential arrangements should consequently be  established for that country in 1991;\nWhereas it is appropriate to add to the list of beneficiary countries Mongolia, at the request of  that country, and Namibia, which has gained its independence;\nWhereas, in view of the situation on agricultural markets both inside and outside the Community  and taking account of the Community`s interest in maintaining harmonious relations in agricultural  trade with developing countries, in particular in the context of the system of generalized  preferences, adjustments should be made to certain specific aspects of the common organizations of  the agricultural markets;\nWhereas to this end a preference should be granted consisting, according to the product concerned,  in a reduction of the import levy within the limits of a fixed quota;\nWhereas the temporary and non-binding nature of the system of generalized preferences means that  the offer may be withdrawn wholly or in part at a later stage, thus maintaining the possibility of  remedying any unfavourable situations which might arise, including in the African, Caribbean and  Pacific States (ACP States) following the implementation of the system;\nWhereas, since 1  March 1986, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic have been applying  the Community system of generalized preferences; whereas the levies applied on the import into  those Member States of products subject to a common organization of the market shall be established  in accordance with certain provisions of the Act of Accession;\nWhereas it is expedient that the Community should authorize the importation of the products  referred to in the Annex, originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the  Community generalized system of preferences, subject to the levies given in respect of each of  them; whereas the benefit of such preferential terms should be reserved for products originating in  the countries and territories under consideration, the concept of 'originating products` being  adopted in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No  693/88  (2);\nWhereas the Republic of Korea does not treat the Community on an equal footing with other trade  partners and whereas it has taken discriminatory measures in respect of the Community in the sphere  of the protection of intellectual property; whereas therefore it is inappropriate that the Republic  of Korea should benefit from the system of generalized tariff preferences as long as this practice  continues;\nWhereas all interested Community traders should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said  fixed amount and the rate of the levy laid down for that final amount should be applied  consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the volumes  laid down are exhausted;\nWhereas the procedure for implementing this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with the  procedure laid down in Article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29  October 1975 on the  common organization of the market in pigmeat  (1) or the corresponding procedure in other  Regulations on the common organization of the market for the products concerned,", "main_body": ["1.

To that end a system of import certificates may be introduced for the products appearing in the  Annex.", "If the Commission discovers that products covered by the arrangements laid down in  Article 1 are being imported into the Community at such prices that they cause or threaten to cause  serious injury to Community producers of like or directly competing products, the levies applied in  the Community may be partly or completely re-established for the products concerned with regard to  the countries or territories causing the injury. Such a measure may also be taken in the case of  serious injury or the threat of serious injury to a specific region of the Community.", "1.
