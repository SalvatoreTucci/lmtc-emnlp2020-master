Where the supplier and the recipient of the services are established in different Member States, the reverse charge mechanism will be applicable more frequently than hitherto.\n(2) To ensure the proper application of value added tax (VAT) on services which are subject to the reverse charge mechanism, the data collected by the Member State of the supplier should be communicated to the Member State where the recipient is established. Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax\u00a0(4) should provide for such communication.\n(3) Directive 2008/8/EC also extends the scope of the special scheme for electronic services supplied by taxable persons not established within the Community.\n(4) Council Directive 2008/9/EC of 12 February 2008 laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC, to taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund but in another Member State\u00a0(5) simplifies the refund procedure for VAT in a Member State in which the taxable person concerned is not identified for VAT purposes.\n(5) The extension of the scope of the special scheme and the amendments to the refund procedure for taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund mean that the Member States concerned will need to exchange considerably more information. The required exchange of information should not make any excessive administrative demands on the Member State concerned. This exchange of information should thus take place electronically under existing systems for exchanging information.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["From 1 January 2010, Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(1), the fourth subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 2, points 8 to 11 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20188. \u201cintra-Community supply of goods\u201d means any supply of goods which must be declared in the recapitulative statement provided for in Article 262 of Directive 2006/112/EC;\n9. \u201cintra-Community supply of services\u201d means any supply of services which must be declared in the recapitulative statement provided for in Article 262 of Directive 2006/112/EC;\n10. \u201cintra-Community acquisition of goods\u201d means the acquisition of the right under Article 20 of Directive 2006/112/EC to dispose as owner of moveable tangible property;\n11. \u201cVAT identification number\u201d means the number provided for in Articles 214, 215 and 216 of Directive 2006/112/EC;\u2019;\n3. in Article 22(1), the first subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\n4. in the first paragraph of Article 23, point 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20182. the total value of all intra-Community supplies of goods and the total value of all intra-Community supplies of services to persons holding a VAT identification number by all operators identified for the purposes of VAT in the Member State providing the information.\u2019;\n5. in Article 24, the first paragraph shall be replaced by the following:\n1. the VAT identification numbers of the persons who carried out the supplies of goods and services referred to in point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 23;\n2. the total value of supplies of goods and services from each such person to each person holding a VAT identification number referred to in point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 23.\u2019;\n6.
