Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export refunds as provided for in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 shall be granted on the products and for the amounts set out in the Annex to this Regulation subject to the conditions provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible for a refund under paragraph 1 products must meet the relevant requirements laid down in Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 15 June 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nJean-Luc DEMARTY\nDirector-General for Agriculture and Rural Development\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
