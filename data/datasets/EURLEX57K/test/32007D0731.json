Areas A and B in the United Kingdom can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(4) The current Annex of Decision 2006/415/EC has become obsolete, because protection measures in relation to an outbreak of avian influenza in Germany have elapsed and therefore the Annex should be replaced as a whole.\n(5) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision should be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
