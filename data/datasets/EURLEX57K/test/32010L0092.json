That list included bromuconazole. By Commission Decision 2008/832/EC\u00a0(4) it was decided not to include bromuconazole in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier, hereinafter \u2018the applicant\u2019, submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(5).\n(3) The application was submitted to Belgium, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as those that were the subject of Decision 2008/832/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008. Belgium evaluated the new information and data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) and to the Commission on 8 October 2010.\n(4) The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the additional report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority. The Authority then presented its conclusion on bromuconazole to the Commission on 29 July 2010\u00a0(6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 23 November 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for bromuconazole.\n(5) The additional report by the rapporteur Member State and the new conclusion by the Authority concentrate on the concerns that lead to the non-inclusion. Those concerns were, in particular, the high risk to aquatic organisms and the lack of information available to assess the potential contamination of surface water and groundwater.\n(6) The new information submitted by the applicant allowed to assess the potential contamination of surface water and groundwater. The information currently available indicates that the risk of groundwater contamination is low and that the risk to aquatic organisms is acceptable.\n(7) Consequently, the additional data and information provided by the applicant permit to eliminate the specific concerns that led to the non-inclusion. No other open scientific questions have arisen.\n(8) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing bromuconazole may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include bromuconazole in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(9) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain confirmatory information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that the inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information on residues of triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs) in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin, in addition to information regarding the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals. To further refine the assessment of potential endocrine disrupting properties, it is appropriate to require that bromuconazole be subjected to further testing as soon as OECD test guidelines on endocrine disruption, or, alternatively, Community agreed test guidelines exist.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2011 at the latest.
