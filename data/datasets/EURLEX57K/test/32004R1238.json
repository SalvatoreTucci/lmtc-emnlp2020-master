Article 6(1) of that Regulation stipulates that delivery must take place by the end of the second month following receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August of the current marketing year.\n(2) As a result of constraints associated with the organisation of the market, following the introduction of the reform of the CAP, resulting from the limiting of the quantities of rice that can be bought into intervention and the fixing of allocation coefficients, it is difficult for the intervention agencies to meet the time limit for the delivery of the products. Consequently, there should be a derogation, for the current 2003/04 marketing year, from the time limit requiring delivery by the end of the second month following.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 708/98, all deliveries of paddy rice for taking over by the intervention agency in respect of the 2003/04 marketing year must take place no later than 31 August 2004.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 June 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.
