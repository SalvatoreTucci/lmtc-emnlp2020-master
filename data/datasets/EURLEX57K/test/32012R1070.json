Regulation (EU) No 581/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) extended the application of Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 until the end of 2015.

It is appropriate, for the sake of proper administration of the imports, that those rules apply also to all other preferential non-quota imports which are covered by Article 2 of that Regulation. In addition, it is appropriate, for the sake of clarity and transparency, that those rules include the obligation to specify the preferential import duty in box 24 of licence applications and licences.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 is amended as follows:\n(1) Chapter II of Title 2 is replaced by the following:\n(a) preferential imports, not subject to quotas, as referred to in:\n(i) Annex I to Protocol 1 to Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council,\n(ii) Annex IV to the Agreement with South Africa,\n(iii) Annex 2 to the Agreement between the European Community and Switzerland on trade in agricultural products;\n(b) any other preferential imports, not subject to quotas, of the products referred to in point J of Part I of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 376/2008.\n(a) in box 8, the country of origin;\n(b) in box 20, one of the entries listed in Annex XVI.\n(2) In Annex I, Part J is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 341, 22.12.2001, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 20, 24.1.2008, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 24.6.2011, p.5.\nANNEX\n\u2027I.J\nTARIFF QUOTA UNDER ANNEX I TO REGULATION (EC) No 55/2008\nQuota number CN code Description\u00a0(1) Country of origin Import year Annual quota from 1 January to 31 December Import duty\nAnnual Six-monthly\n09.4210 0401 to 0406  The Republic of Moldova    0\nDairy products From 1 July to 31 December 2008  1\u00a0000\n2009 1\u00a0000 500\n2010 to 2015 1\u00a0500 750\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the product description must be considered to have merely indicative value, since the applicability of the preferential arrangements is determined in the context of this Annex by the scope of the CN code.
