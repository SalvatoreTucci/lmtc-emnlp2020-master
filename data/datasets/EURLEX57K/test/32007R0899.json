Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000, relating to ozone depleting substances and mixtures containing ozone depleting substances, refers to some of those CN-codes. It is therefore necessary to adjust that Annex. In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires it to be replaced in its entirety.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) Since Regulation (EC) No 1549/2006 entered into force on 1 January 2007, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02037/2000,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 July 2007.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 244, 29.9.2000, p. 1.
