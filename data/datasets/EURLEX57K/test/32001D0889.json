That procedure has been applied and the report issued on the outcome has been considered by the Commission.\n(4) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 provide that refunds on exports to third countries and intervention intended to stabilise agricultural markets may be financed only where they are, respectively, granted and undertaken in accordance with the Community rules governing the common organisation of the agricultural markets.\n(5) The findings of checks performed, the results of bilateral discussions and the outcome of the conciliation procedures have shown that some expenditure declared by Italy does not meet those conditions and cannot therefore be financed under the EAGGF Guarantee Section.\n(6) The Annex to this Decision sets out the amounts that are not recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Those amounts do not relate to expenditure incurred more than 24 months before the Commission's written notification of the results of the checks to Italy.\n(7) As regards the cases covered by this Decision, the assessment of the amounts to be excluded on grounds of non-compliance with Community rules was notified by the Commission to Italy and is set out in a summary report on the subject.\n(8) This Decision is without prejudice to any financial conclusions that the Commission may draw from the judgments of the Court of Justice in cases pending on 1 November 2001 and relating to the subject thereof,", "main_body": ["The expenditure itemised in the Annex that has been incurred by Italy's accredited paying agency and declared under the EAGGF Guarantee Section is hereby excluded from Community financing because it does not comply with Community rules.", "This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.\n(2) OJ L 125, 8.6.1995, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 158, 8.7.1995, p. 6.\n(4) OJ L 274, 17.10.2001, p. 3.\n(5) OJ L 182, 16.7.1994, p. 45.\n(6) OJ L 193, 17.7.2001, p. 25.\nANNEX\nTotal corrections\n(National currency)\n>TABLE>\nTotal corrections in euro\n>TABLE>"}
