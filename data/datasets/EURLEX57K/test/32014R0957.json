Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 the re-evaluation of food additives other than colours and sweeteners has to be done until 31 December 2018. However, certain food additives, including montan acid esters (E 912), havehigher priority and should be evaluated earlier.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the interested business operator(s) and any other interested party shall submit the data related to the re-evaluation of a food additive within the period set by the Authority in its call for data.\n(7) On 15 February 2012 the Authority launched a public call for scientific data on montan acid esters (E 912)\u00a0(4) inviting interested parties and stakeholders to submit the requested data or to provide information by 1 June 2012.\n(8) On 7 June 2013 the Authority delivered a Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of montan acid esters (E 912) as food additives\u00a0(5). The opinion stated that no data on toxicokinetics and reproductive and developmental toxicity of montan acid esters were available. The available data on short-term and subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of montan acid esters were limited. No data on the usage were submitted. Based on those limitations the Authority concluded that montan acid esters as food additive could not be evaluated.\n(9) Article 6(5) of Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 provides that where the information necessary for the completion of the re-evaluation of a particular food additive is not provided by the interested business operator(s) and any other interested party to the Authority within the set deadlines, the food additive may be removed from the Union list of approved food additives in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. Accordingly, the specifications of this food additive should also be removed from Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.\n(10) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, the Union list of approved food additives shall be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6).\n(11) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 provides that the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.\n(12) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should be amended by removing montan acid esters (E 912) from the Union list of authorised food additives since due to the absence of recent scientific evidence its inclusion in the list can no longer be justified.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nFoods containing montan acid esters (E 912) that have been lawfully placed on the market before the entry into for of this Regulation, may continue to be marketed until stocks are exhausted.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up the program for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives (OJ L\u00a080, 26.3.2010, p.\u00a019).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/dataclosed/call/120215a.htm\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(6):3236.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Part B, in Section 3 \u2018Additives other than colours and sweeteners\u2019, the entry for the food additive E 912 is deleted.\n(2) In Part E, in food category 4.1.1 \u2018Entire fresh fruit and vegetables\u2019, the entry for the food additive E 912 is deleted.\nANNEX II\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, the entry for food additive E 912 is deleted."}
