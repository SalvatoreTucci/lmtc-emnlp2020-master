whereas, in a later stage, borders with other neighbouring countries benefiting from PHARE or other Community assistance programmes may also become eligible;\nWhereas eligible actions should be similar to Interreg within the overall framework of the accession partnerships;\nWhereas it is necessary to strengthen the involvement of local and regional actors in cross-border cooperation, to enhance the botton-up approach, to bolster their capacities for programming, implementation and monitoring, and to allow local authorities in border regions to take decisions on small projects of a real cross-border nature through setting up small project funds;\nWhereas it is necessary to replace Regulation (EC) No 1628/94;\nWhereas the present Regulation is in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Economic Restructuring in certain countries of central and eastern Europe,", "main_body": ["Within the overall framework of the PHARE programme as defined by Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89, the following rules shall apply for financing actions of a structural nature in border regions of countries of central and eastern Europe, which are PHARE beneficiaries.\nThese actions will be implemented taking into account the Community structural policies, and Interreg in particular.", "1. The eligible borders are those between the countries of central and eastern Europe and the Community, and those between the following applicant countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n2. The border regions concerned will be fixed by each country concerned in agreement with the Commission, taking into account the methodology adopted for Interreg.\n3. Allocations between beneficiary countries shall be made taking into account criteria of population, GDP per capita and surface of the border regions concerned.", "Community grants under this programme will primarily finance the participation of the country of central and eastern Europe concerned in joint projects with each State with which it shares a border as defined in Article 2.\nThe aims of these projects are:\n(i) to promote cooperation of border regions in countries in central and eastern Europe with adjacent regions in a neighbouring country as defined in Article 1 and thus to help the border regions in central and eastern Europe to overcome the specific development problems which may arise, inter alia, from their position within the national economies, in the interest of the local population and in a manner compatible with the protection of the environment;\n(ii) to promote the creation and the development of cooperation networks on either side of the border, and the establishment of links between these networks and wider Community networks.", "1. In the border regions selected according to Article 2, the projects to be included in the cross-border cooperation programme can take the form of:\n(i) projects linked with measures that are supported by Interreg or by other Community external assistance programmes;\n(ii) projects agreed by the countries concerned, that have a cross-border impact, contribute to the development of structures in border regions and facilitate cooperation between the countries as a whole.\n2. Special attention will be given to projects in relation to which co-financing by, or on behalf of, the local authorities or economic operators in the countries of central and eastern Europe is provided.\n3. Financing may include resources from other Member States of the European Union and countries of central and eastern Europe, from international financial institutions, and from other private and public sources.", "1.

With a view to encouraging joint small scale actions involving local actors from the border regions and to enhancing their capabilities to identify, develop and implement such actions, a joint small project fund may be established in each border region, for which a limited percentage of the appropriations for the relevant programmes and initiatives for cross-border cooperation may be used.\n3. Special attention will be given to measures with a strong cross-border cooperation character which are planned in close cooperation with the regional and local authorities in border areas and which include the establishment or development of shared management structures intended to widen and deepen cross-border cooperation between public and para-public agencies as well as non-profit organisations.\n4. The establishment of plans for the development of border regions, project identification and programme formulation, feasibility studies, assistance for the implementation of the programmes and monitoring and/or evaluation studies, may also be financed.", "1. The Community contribution is provided in principle as a grant. However, whenever the Community grant contributes to the financing of revenue-generating activities, the Commission shall determine, in consultation with the authorities involved, the rules for financing which may include co-financing by the project's revenues or reimbursement of the initial grants.\n2. The aid may cover expenditures on imports and local expenditure needed to carry out the projects and programmes.\nTax duties and charges and the purchase of property shall be excluded from the Community financing.\n3. Costs covered may include technical assistance, studies, training and other institution-building measures; supply programmes for essential equipment or inputs; investment operations, including work programmes.\n4. Maintenance and operating costs in central and eastern European countries may be covered in the start-up phase and in a digressive manner.", "1. For each of the border regions, a Joint Cooperation Committee will be set up consisting of representatives of the countries concerned including regional or local representatives, and of representatives of the Commission.\n2. The Joint Cooperation Committee will prepare a joint cross-border programming document in a multiannual perspective; this document will include common development strategies and priorities for the region, seen as one single socio-economic and geographical entity, and provisions concerning joint implementation. This document will guide the programming and implementation of the actions to be undertaken in the framework of the relevant programmes and initiatives for cross-border cooperation, assisted by the European Community.\n3. The Joint Cooperation Committee will define a common set of projects once per year, taking into account the joint cross-border programming document provided under paragraph 2. Recommendations for projects will be transmitted to the Commission by the Government of the country of central and eastern Europe concerned on the basis of the proposals submitted by the relevant authorities.", "1.

The grant constituting the full or partial contribution of the country of central and eastern Europe to the joint project will be approved following the procedure defined in Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 and agreed with the recipient country concerned by means of a financing memorandum.", "1. The Commission shall administer this assistance in accordance with the normal practice applied to the assistance to central and eastern Europe, as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89.\n2.
