In November 2008, the Serbian authorities agreed initially with the IMF on a new Stand-By Arrangement which was approved in January 2009.\n(4) Following a further deterioration of the economic situation and a necessary revision of the programme\u2019s underlying economic assumptions as well as higher external financing needs, an agreement was reached between Serbia and the IMF in March 2009 to turn the Stand-By Arrangement into a EUR 3 billion disbursing programme, which was approved on 15 May 2009 by the IMF Board.\n(5) The Community intends to provide in 2009 and 2010 Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) budget support grants of a total of EUR 100 million.\n(6) Serbia has requested additional Community macro-financial assistance in view of the worsening economic situation and outlook.\n(7) Given that a residual financing gap remains in the balance of payments in 2010, macro-financial assistance is considered an appropriate response to Serbia\u2019s request under the current exceptional circumstances to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the current IMF programme. The present financial assistance is also expected to contribute to alleviating budgetary financing needs.\n(8) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Community\u2019s financial interests linked to the present financial assistance, it is necessary to provide for appropriate measures by Serbia related to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, as well as for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors.\n(9) The release of the Community financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.\n(10) This assistance should be managed by the Commission, in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee.\n(11) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those of Article 308,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall make available to Serbia macro-financial assistance in the form of a loan facility with a maximum principal amount of EUR 200 million and a maximum average maturity of 15 years with a view to supporting Serbia\u2019s economic stabilisation and alleviating its balance of payments and budgetary needs as identified in the current IMF programme.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To this end, the Commission is empowered to borrow on behalf of the Community the necessary resources.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The release of the Community financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission, in close cooperation with the Economic and Financial Committee, in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Serbia.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community financial assistance shall be made available for two years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 2(1).
