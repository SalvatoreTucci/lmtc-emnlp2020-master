That Part sets out a non-specific treatment \u2018A\u2019 and specific treatments \u2018B\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019 listed in descending order of severity.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010\u00a0(4) lays down the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals or fresh meat. It also lays down the lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which those consignments may be introduced into the Union.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 provides that consignments of fresh meat intended for human consumption are to be imported into the Union only if they come from the third countries, territories or parts thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Regulation for which there is a model veterinary certificate corresponding to the consignment concerned listed in that Part.\n(6) Croatia is currently listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as a third country from which imports of fresh meat of certain animals into the Union are authorised. However, Croatia is currently not listed as a third country from which imports of fresh meat, including minced meat, of domestic porcine animals into the Union are authorised.\n(7) Croatia has submitted to the Commission a request to be authorised to export fresh meat of domestic porcine animals into the Union. According to the information submitted by Croatia, preventive vaccination against classical swine fever is prohibited on the territory of that third country since January 2005. In addition, there is no evidence of classical swine fever virus circulation in domestic porcine animals on the territory of Croatia since March 2008. The information available therefore indicates that Croatia is free from classical swine fever in domestic porcine animals, without vaccination.\n(8) The Croatian competent authority has also provided sufficient guarantees as regards compliance with the Union legislation regarding classical swine fever and it is implementing an enhanced surveillance programme for domestic porcine animals and wild boar.\n(9) In addition, the results of an inspection carried out by the Commission in Croatia in 2010 were largely positive. Croatia has also submitted to the Commission the confirmation that certain planned corrective actions regarding the shortcomings identified during that inspection were satifactorily implemented in 2011.\n(10) The evaluation of the information submitted by Croatia leads to the conclusion that the introduction into the Union of fresh meat of domestic porcine animals from that third country does not constitute a risk to the Union health status with regard to classical swine fever. Imports from Croatia of fresh meat, including minced meat, of domestic porcine animals into the Union should therefore be permitted.\n(11) In addition, Croatia is currently listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC for the introduction into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines from domestic porcine animals and farmed cloven-hoofed game (swine) which have undergone the specific treatment \u2018D\u2019.\n(12) In view of the fact that imports of fresh meat, including minced meat, of domestic porcine animals into the Union from Croatia are to be authorised, it is appropriate to also permit imports into the Union from that third country of meat products which were obtained from such fresh meat, without requiring that they undergo a specific treatment. Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC, the entry for Croatia is replaced by the following:\n\u2018HR Croatia A A A A A A A A D XXX A A XXX\u2019", "In Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, the entry for Croatia is replaced by the following:\n\u2018HR \u2014 Croatia HR-0 Whole country BOV, OVI, EQU, RUF, RUW\nPOR    8 November 2012\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 30.11.2007, p. 49.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 20.3.2010, p. 1."}
