As those data are to serve as the basis for determining the specific CO2 emissions target for manufacturers of new passenger cars and for the assessment of whether manufacturers comply with those targets, it is necessary to harmonise the rules on the collection and reporting of those data.\n(2) In order to assess fully whether each manufacturer complies with its specific CO2 emissions target established according Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and to gain the necessary experience of the application of that Regulation, the Commission needs detailed data at manufacturer level for each vehicle series defined by type, variant and version. Member States should therefore ensure that such data are recorded and transmitted to the Commission together with the aggregated data in accordance with Article 8(2) of that Regulation.\n(3) Pursuant to Articles 18 and 26 of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles\u00a0(2), a manufacturer must ensure that each new passenger car placed on the market in the EU is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity and a Member State cannot register such a vehicle unless it is accompanied by such a certificate of conformity. It is logical, therefore, that the certificate of conformity should be the primary source for the information that the Member States are required to record, make available to manufacturers pursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and report to the Commission. In order to allow Member States to use information from sources other than the certificate of conformity, as indicated in recital 26 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, for the purpose of completing the process of registration and entry into service of a new passenger car, it is appropriate to establish which other documents provide equivalent accuracy and which therefore should also be permitted for use by the Member States.\n(4) It is important that the data on the registration of new passenger cars is accurate and can be processed effectively for the purpose of establishing the specific emission target in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. Manufacturers should therefore provide the Commission with up-to-date information on the names and the first section of the Vehicle Identification Number as specified in Council Directive 76/114/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to statutory plates and inscriptions for motor vehicles and their trailers, and their location and method of attachment\u00a0(3) that are used on the certificates of conformity in the different Member States of registration. That information will enable the Commission to provide the Member States with an updated list of designated manufacturers\u2019 names which should be used for the purpose of data reporting.\n(5) Member States should record and report information about newly registered vehicles that are designed to use alternative fuels. In order to allow the Commission to take into account reductions to the specific emissions target due to the use of ethanol (E85) fuel in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, Member States should provide the Commission with the necessary information including the proportion of filling stations in their territory and, where applicable, the total number of those which provide ethanol (E85) fuel meeting the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC\u00a0(4), and in Article 7b of Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC\u00a0(5).\n(6) Articles 23 and 24 of Directive 2007/46/EC provide for a simplified approval procedure for which it is not required to issue a European certificate of conformity. Member States should monitor the number of vehicles registered under those procedures in order to assess its impact on the monitoring process and the attainment of the EU\u2019s average CO2 emissions target for the new passenger car fleet.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nIn addition to the definitions set out in Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018type-approval documentation\u2019 means the documents including the data specified in the third column of the table set out in Annex I to this Regulation;\n(2) \u2018aggregated monitoring data\u2019 means the aggregated data specified in the first table in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009;\n(3) \u2018detailed monitoring data\u2019 means the detailed data specified in the second table in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 which is disaggregated by manufacturer and vehicle series as defined by the type, variant and version;\n(4) \u2018base vehicle\u2019 is as defined in Article 3(18) of Directive 2007/46/EC;\n(5) \u2018bi-fuel gas vehicle\u2019 and \u2018flex-fuel ethanol vehicle\u2019 are as defined in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008\u00a0(6).", "Data transmission\nThe aggregated monitoring data together with the detailed monitoring data shall be transmitted by the Member States via electronic data transfer to the Central Data Repository managed by the European Environmental Agency.
