The system applies to those mining undertakings that have concluded coal supply contracts with the electricity producers under the NSCCT system.\nThe measure covers some 3 million tce (tonnes of coal equivalent) of Spanish coal a year.\nThis is a measure linked to coal sales which, even if not borne directly by public authority budgets, is nevertheless financed from levies imposed through a measure introduced by the State.\nIt also gives coal industry undertakings an economic advantage and therefore represents an indirect aid to this industry withinthe meaning of Article 1 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nIt must therefore be submitted for a Commission opinion pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 (2) of that Decision.\nIII\nIn Decisions 87/454/ECSC (2) and 88/505/ECSC (3), the Commission authorized Ofico financial measures amounting to Pta 8 400 million in 1987 and Pta 8 400 million for 1988. The Commission authorized this aid in view of the fact that the new system was intended to make the industry more competitive and that the precipitate closure of uneconomic installations was likely to cause major social and regional problems. To this extent the measure was also calculated to attenuate the social and regional problems encountered in this industry.\nThe increases now notified for 1987 and 1988 mean that the total sums set aside for these two years are Pta 11 770 and 11 182 million respectively.\nIV\nThe trend during the first few years in which the system has been in operation has to be evaluated in the light of the aims of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, particularly those set out in Article 2 (1).\nIn this connection it should be emphasized that the intended aim of this instrument is to bring about some improvement in the competitivity of the coal industry through the financial reorganization of the undertakings, a lowering of production costs and the shutting down of those production capacities which have no prospect of becoming economically viable in the long term.\nHowever, the provisions introduced under the system do not indicate that there is any likelihood of a reduction in overall levels of aid. In fact, the sum notified for 1989, i. e. Pta 12 625 million, represents an increase of some 13 % over 1988.\nV\nIn view of the transitional nature of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC which expires on 31 December 1993, and the need to ensure the economic viability of the Community's coal industry in the long term, it is necessary to ensure that Community aid is sufficiently degressive and goes hand in hand with the kind of restructuring, rationalization and modernization plans listed among the conditions subject to which the provisions of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC may be applied.\nTo enable the Commission to check whether these conditions are respected, the Spanish authorities should be requested to submit, by 30 June 1990, a plan for reducing, by 31 December 1993, the compensatory payments made under the said system or under any other measure having equivalent effect.\nThis Decision does not call into question the compatibility of the NSCCT with the provisions of the EEC and ECSC Treaties,", "main_body": ["The compensatory payments to be made to electricity producers under the Ofico financial measure, notified in the letters dated 22 September and 13 October 1988 and 23 May, 26 September and 9 November 1989 shall be regarded as Community aid to the coal industry under Article 2 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, and therefore compatible with the smooth functioning of the common market, because:\n- putting an immediate stop to this aid would aggravate the social and regional problems linked with changes in this industry, and\n- if the industry is to be made more competitive, the aid should be reduced gradually and this reduction should go hand in hand with the restructuring, modernization and rationalization of the Spanish coal industry.", "The Government of Spain shall submit to the Commission by 30 June 1990 a plan for reducing between now and 31 December 1993 at the latest the compensatory payments made under this system or any other measures having equivalent effect.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 1989.\nFor the Commission\nAnt\u0e23\u0e13nio CARDOSO E CUNHA\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 241, 25. 8. 1987, p. 16.\n(3) OJ No L 274, 6. 10. 1988, p. 41."}
