Reduce water pollution\n- the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the discharges from the production of both pulp and pulp and paper shall not exceed 30 kg per Adt (2),\n- the amount of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) in the discharges from the production of both pulp and pulp and paper shall not exceed 0,30 kg per Adt.\nData on water consumption per Adt of pulp and paper in the various stages of the production process should be reported.\n2. Reduce sulphur emissions\n- the sulphur emissions into the air from the production of both pulp and pulp and paper shall not exceed 1,5 kg S per Adt.\n3. Save energy\n- total energy consumption for the whole pulp and paper production process shall not exceed 30 G joule per Adt of pulp and paper,\n- purchased energy shall not exceed 18 G joule per Adt of pulp and paper.\n4. Commitment to safeguard forests\nA declaration, charter, code of conduct or statement reflecting the commitment, applicable to the operators in charge of managing the forests from which the fibres originate, meant to implement principles and measures aimed at ensuring sustainable forest management, shall be presented (3).\nIn Europe, the principles and measures referred to above, shall correspond to those of the Helsinki Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (Helsinki, June 1993).\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nThe product must bear the following information on the primary and secondary package:\n- 'product in compliance with the ecological criteria of the European eco-label award scheme`\n- 'contributes to reduction of water pollution, global warming and acidification, saving of energy and safeguarding of forests`.\nTechnical Appendix\nDefinitions and testing requirements\nSustainable forest management\nThe companies applying for an eco-label shall provide a document from the relevant body stating that the principles laid down by the Helsinki Ministerial Conference (4) are applied to the respective forests. Non-European manufacturers may provide an equivalent document according to other international or national agreements or programmes on sustainable forest management, such as Rio Agenda 21.\nFor paper production for which part or all of the pulp is coming from non-integrated sources the applicants shall provide declarations from all respective pulp suppliers.\nSulphur emissions\nThe applicant shall provide a balance on the air emissions of sulphur. This balance must include all sulphur emissions which occur during the production of pulp and paper. Measurements must include recovery boilers, lime kilns, steam boilers and destructor furnaces for strong smelling gases, if available. Diffuse emissions must be accounted for.\nThe emissions from the on-site production of electricity must not be accounted for.\nEnergy consumption\nThe applicant shall calculate all energy inputs during the production of pulp and paper. This shall include recovered energy from the processing which, for example, is gained by incinerating liquors and wastes as well as the energy used in the de-inking of waste papers for the production of recycled paper.\nDefinitions\nTotal energy includes purchased energy plus any kind of other energy supplies such as waste, wood waste, saw dust, liquor, waste paper, paper broke.\nPurchased energy means net imported energy coming from outside the production process, e.g. gas, oil, coal, electric energy from the grid.\nChemical oxygen demand (COD)\nMeasurements may be taken either after treatment at the plant or after treatment by a public treatment plan.\nCOD shall be measured on unfiltered and unsettled samples in accordance with ISO 6060 or equivalent standards, carried out by independent test institutes or accredited laboratories. The measurement must be representative for the respective campaign. At the date of application this measurement must have been taken within the previous 12-month period.\nAdsorbable organic halogens (AOX)\nMeasurements may be taken either after treatment at the plant or after treatment by a public treatment plant.\nAOX shall be measured on unfiltered and unsettled samples in accordance with ISO 9562 or equivalent standards, carried out by independent test institutes or accredited laboratories. The measurement must be representative for the respective campaign. At the date of application this measurement must have been taken within the previous 12-month period.\n(1) Like Emas, ISO 14001 or equivalent European or national standards.\n(2) Air-dry tonne.\n(3) Not required in the case of 100 % recycled paper or if non-wood based fibres are used.\n(4) 'General guidelines for the sustainable management of forests in Europe`, resolution H 1, adopted by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forest in Europe, Helsinki June 1993."}
