Such authorisations have to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\n(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\n(3) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.\n(4) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.\n(5) Information on new or changed uses of diquat covered by Directive 90/642/EEC has been notified to the Commission.\n(6) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides, has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(3). It has been calculated that the MRLs concerned will ensure that the acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.\n(7) An assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short term assessment is not needed.\n(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of diquat.\n(9) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for diquat in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of diquat. The provisional Community MRL should then become definitive.\n(10) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended as follows.
