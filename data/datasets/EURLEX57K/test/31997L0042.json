whereas, therefore, a new, more precise wording is called for;\n(7) Whereas Article 16 of Directive 90/394/EEC makes provision for the establishment of exposure limit values on the basis of the available information, including scientific and technical data, in respect of all those carcinogens for which this is possible;\n(8) Whereas occupational exposure limit values must be regarded as an important component of the general arrangements for the protection of workers; whereas such limit values must be revised whenever this becomes necessary in the light of more recent scientific data;\n(9) Whereas benzene is a carcinogen which is present in many work situations; whereas, therefore, a large number of workers are exposed to a potential health risk; whereas, although current scientific knowledge is not such that a level can be established below which risks to health cease to exist, a reduction in exposure to benzene will nonetheless reduce these risks;\n(10) Whereas the respect of the minimum requirements on the protection of health and safety of workers from the specific risks related to carcinogens aims not only to ensure the protection of the health and safety of each individual worker but also to provide a level of minimum protection of all workers in the Community;\n(11) Whereas a consistent level of protection from the risks related to carcinogens has to be established for the Community as a whole and whereas that level of protection has to be set not by detailed prescriptive requirements but by a framework of general principles to enable Member States to apply the minimum requirements consistently;\n(12) Whereas this amendment constitutes a practical aspect of the realization of the social dimension of the internal market;\n(13) Whereas, pursuant to Decision 74/325/EEC (6), the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work is to be consulted by the Commission with a view to drawing up proposals in this field,", "main_body": ["Directive 90/394/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, the following paragraph shall be added:\n'4.
