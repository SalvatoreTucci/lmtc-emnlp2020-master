On the basis of that opinion, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides Sweden with a derogation to examine only a random sample of healthy slaughtered bovine animals born and reared on its territory. In its updated opinion adopted in July 2004 on the geographical BSE risk of Sweden the European Food Safety Authority supported this position classifying Sweden in GBR category II, i.e. that it is unlikely domestic cattle are infected with BSE-agent, but not excluded. In addition, Sweden could benefit from a derogation to allow the use of the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from bovine animals under certain conditions. However, Sweden never applied that derogation.\n(3) On 3 March 2006 the Community Reference Laboratory for TSEs confirmed the first case of BSE in Sweden. Therefore, as the occurrence of BSE in native cattle may no longer be considered unlikely, it is no longer appropriate that Sweden should benefit from derogations in respect of the monitoring of healthy slaughter cattle and of the age limit for the removal of vertebral column from bovine animals.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annexes to Regulation (EC) 999/2001 are amended as follows:\n(a) in Annex III, Part I of Chapter A, point 2.3 is deleted;\n(b) in Annex XI, Part A, the second subparagraph of point 2 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 May 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.
