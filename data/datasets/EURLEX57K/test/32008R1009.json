The simple fact that the date of birth, death or of any movement of the animal is not reported to the competent authority within the period referred to in the second indent of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 should not automatically disqualify it from any payment. The beginning of the animal\u2019s retention period may also be considered as an appropriate time to check that the animal concerned is actually identified and registered for the purpose of granting the payments under Chapter 12 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n(5) Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The scope of this amendment is limited to the purpose of establishing eligibility for payments. This amendment does not alter the traceability of the animals, as farmers remain obliged to comply with all the identification and registration requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000.\n(7) The obligation laid down in Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should apply to all payments under Chapter 12 of Title IV of the said Regulation. Since the reference period established for the management of those payments is the calendar year, this amendment should be applicable as from 1 January 2008 in order to apply to all the payments at stake during the whole 2008 calendar year,", "main_body": ["In Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the following paragraph shall be added:\n\u2018Nevertheless, an animal shall also be deemed eligible for the payment where the information laid down in the second indent of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 has been reported to the competent authority on the first day of the animal\u2019s retention period, as determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 144(2) of this Regulation.\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply as from 1 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 9 October 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
