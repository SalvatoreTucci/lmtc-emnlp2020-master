In particular, it provides for tendering periods during which tenders may be lodged.\n(2) In order to respond better to the deterioration of the dairy market that occurred at the beginning of 2009, Regulation (EC) No 619/2008 was amended in order to provide for two tendering periods per month. The substantial improvement of the market situation since then allows to set the number of tendering periods again at one per month.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 619/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 619/2008, the introductory words of the third subparagraph are replaced by the following:\n\u2018Each tendering period shall end at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the third Tuesday of the month with the following exceptions:\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 28.6.2008, p. 20."}
