SAMPLING\nAccording to ICC Standard No 101.\n7. PROCEDURE\n7.1. Determination of water uptake\nDetermine the water absorption according to ICC Standard No 115 (see also 10.1).\n7.2. Determination of malt flour addition\nDetermine the 'falling number' of the flour according to ISO 3093-1974. If the 'falling number' is higher than 250, determine the malt flour addition required to bring the 'falling number' within the range 200 to 250, using a series of mixtures of the flour with increasing quantities of malt flour (4.5). If the 'falling number' is lower than 250, no malt flour is required.\n7.3. Reactivation of active dry yeast\nAdjust the temperature of the sugar solution (4.4) to 35 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Pour one part by weight of the active dry yeast into four parts by weight of this tempered sugar solution. Do not stir. Swirl if necessary.\nAllow to stand for 10 \u00b1 one minute, then stir until a homogeneous suspension is obtained. Use this suspension within 10 minutes.\n7.4. Temperature adjustment of the flour and the dough liquid.\nThe temperature of the flour and the water must be adjusted to give a dough temperature of 27 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C after mixing.\n7.5. Dough composition\nWeigh, with a precision of 2 g, 10y/3 g flour on as-is moisture basis (corresponding to 1 kg flour on a 14 % mb), in which 'y' is the quantity of flour used in the farinograph test (see ICC Standard No 115, clause 9.1).\nWeigh, with a precision of 0,2 g, the quantity of malt flour necessary to bring the 'falling number' within the range 200 to 250 (7.2).\nWeigh 430 \u00b1 5 g sugar-salt-ascorbic acid solution (4.3) and add water to a total mass of (\u00d7-9) ;  10y/3 g (see 10.2) in which 'x' is the quantity of water used in the farinograph test (see ICC Standard No 115, clause 9.1). This total mass (usually between 450 and 650 g) must be achieved with a precision of 1,5 g.\nWeigh 90 \u00b1 1 g yeast suspension (7.3).\nNote the total mass of the dough (P), which is the sum of the masses of flour, sugar-salt-ascorbic acid solution plus water, yeast suspension and malt flour.\n7.6. Mixing\nBefore starting, bring the mixer to a temperature of 27 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C by use of a suitable quantity of tempered water.\nPlace the liquid dough ingredients in the mixer and place the flour plus malt flour on top.\nStart the mixer (speed 1, 1 400 rev/min and allow to run for 60 seconds. 20 seconds after the start of mixing, turn the scraper attached to the lid of the mixing bowl two revolutions.\nMeasure the temperature of the dough. If it is outside the range 26 to 28 \u00b0C, discard the dough and mix a new one after adjustment of ingredient temperatures.\nNote dough properties using one of the following terms:\n- non-sticky and machinable, for\n- sticky and non-machinable. To be considered as 'non-sticky and machinable' at the end of mixing, the dough should form a coherent mass which hardly adheres to the sides of the bowl and spindle of the mixer. It should be possible to collect the dough by hand and remove it from the mixing bowl in a single motion without noticeable loss.\n7.7. Dividing and rounding\nWeigh, with precision of 2 g, three pieces of dough according to the formula:\np = 0,25 P where:\np = mass of scaled dough piece;\nP = total mass of dough.\nImmediately round the pieces for 15 seconds in the moulder (5.10) and place them for 30 \u00b1 2 minutes on the square plastic sheets (5.9), covered by the inverted plastic boxes (5.8) in the proving cabinet (5.7). Do not use dusting flour.\n7.8. Moulding\nBring the pieces of dough on the plastic sheets, covered by the inverted boxes, to the moulder (5.10), and re-round each piece for 15 seconds. Do not remove cover from a piece of dough until immediately before rounding. Note dough properties again, using one of the following terms:\n- non-sticky and machinable, or\n- sticky and non-machinable.\nTo be considered as 'non-sticky and machinable' the dough should adhere hardly, or not at all, to the sides of the chamber so that it can freely rotate around itself and form a regular ball during the operation of the machine. At the end of the operation the dough should not stick to the sides of the dough-moulding chamber when the lid of the chamber is raised.\n7.9.\n7.10.\n8.\n9. TEST REPORT\nThe test report should mention:\n- dough handling properties at the end of mixing, and at moulding,\n- the 'falling number' of the flour without addition of malt flour,\n- any anomalies observed.\nIt should further include:\n- the method used,\n- all details required for the identification of the sample.\n10. GENERAL REMARKS\n10.1. The English version of ICC Standard No 115 is the authentic text. As the French and German versions are not in conformity with this text, they must not be used.\n10.2. The formula for the calculation of the quantity of dough liquid is based on the following considerations:\nAddition of x ml water to the equivalent of 300 g flour at 14 % moisture produces the required consistency. As in the baking test 1 kg of flour (14 % moisture basis) is used, whereas x is based on 300 g of flour, for the baking test x divided by three and multiplied by 10 g of water is needed, so 10x/3 g. The 430 g sugar-salt-ascorbic acid solution contains 15 g salt and 15 g sugar. This 430 g solution is included in the dough liquid. So to add 10x/3 g water to the dough, (10x/3 + 30) g dough liquid composed of the 430 g sugar-salt-ascorbic acid solution and an additional quantity of water must be added. Although part of the water added with the yeast suspension is absorbed by the yeast, this suspension also contains 'free' water. It is arbitrarily supposed that 90 g yeast suspension contains 60 g 'free' water. The quantity of the dough liquid must be corrected for this 60 g of 'free' water in the yeast suspension, so 10x/3 plus 30 minus 60 g must finally be added. This can be rearranged as follows:\n(10x/3 + 30) - 60 = 10x/3 - 30 = (x/3 - 3) 10 = (x - 9) 10/3, the formula given in clause 7.5. If, e.g., a water addition x in the farinograph test was found of 165 ml, this value must be substituted in this formula, so to the 430 g sugar-salt-ascorbic acid solution water must be added to a total mass of:\n(165 - 9) 10/3 = 156 ; 10/3 = 520 g.\n10.3. The method is not directly applicable to wheat. The procedure to be followed for characterizing the baking properties of wheat is as follows:\nClean the wheat, and determine the moisture content of the cleaned wheat. If the moisture content is within the range 15 to 16 %, do not temper the wheat. If the moisture content is outside this range, adjust the moisture content to 15,5 \u00b1 0,5 %, at least three hours prior to milling.\nMill the wheat into flour using a Buehler laboratory mill MLU 202 or a Brabender Quadrumat Senior mill or similar equipment having the same characteristics.\nChoose a milling procedure that yields a flour of minimum 72 % extraction, with an ash content of 0,50 to 0,60 % on dry matter basis. Determine the ash content of the flour according to the Annex to Commission Regulation No 162/67/EEC (OJ No 128, 27. 6. 1967, p. 2574/67) and the moisture content according to Annex II to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2731/75 (OJ No L 281, 1. 11. 1975, p. 22). Calculate the extraction rate by the equation:\n1.2.3.4 //  // E =   // (100 - f) F (100 - w) W   // ; 100 %\nin which:\n1.2 // E   // = extraction rate;   // f   // = moisture of the flour;   // w   // = moisture content of the wheat;   // F  // = mass of flour produced with moisture content 'f';   // W  // = mass of wheat milled with moisture content 'w'.\nNote: Information concerning the ingredients and equipment to be used is published in Document T 77/300 of 31 March 1977 from the Instituut voor Graan, Meel en Brood, TNO - Postbus 15, Wageningen (Nederland).'"}
