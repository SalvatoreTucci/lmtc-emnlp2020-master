whereas the said codes come into consideration for classification of the gas oil in question;\nWhereas Additional Note 4 to Chapter 27 lists the operations to which the term \u2018specific process\u2019 can be taken to apply; whereas subparagraph (a) of that note reads as follows: \u2018vacuum distillation\u2019; whereas consequently the classification of the gas oil in question in CN code 2710\u00a000\u00a061 or CN code 2710\u00a000\u00a069 depends on whether or not the process referred to at the first recital may be regarded as a \u2018specific process\u2019 for the purposes of the aforementioned Note 4 (a);\nWhereas, although Note 4 (a) is limited to mentioning the process \u2018vacuum distillation\u2019 and whereas the Explanatory Note to the combined nomenclature concerning this Note 4 (a) states that \u2018Vacuum distillation means distillation under a pressure not exceeding 400 mbar, measured at the head of the column\u2019, the structure and content of Chapter 27 indicate that an operation may be regarded as a \u2018specific process\u2019, i.e. give entitlement to exemption from customs duty, only if it appreciably changes the characteristics of the basic product;\nWhereas the process of vacuum distillation in question does not have the effect of appreciably changing the characteristics of the basic product; whereas, in reality, it does not appear to be justified either by technical or economic reasons, if the flash-point of the basic imported product is higher than that generally required for marketing the product as gas oil; whereas, in effect, the gas oil in question may be used as diesel fuel or as light heating fuel before as well as after the process indicated at the first recital; whereas on the other hand in so far as the existence of the abovementioned explanatory note is concerned, although it technically incorporates the legal text, it is equally established that the latter shall be interpreted and applied within the constraints deriving from the existence of the footnote establishing \u2018end use\u2019 and therefore from Community legislation in this matter;\nWhereas the process to which the gas oil is submitted cannot be considered a specific process within the meaning of the aforementioned Note 4 (a); whereas, consequently, this gas oil is classified in code 2710\u00a000\u00a069;\nWhereas the Nomenclture Committee has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["A gas oil, having a flash-point equal to or above 55 oC for undergoing a process of vacuum distillation in order to raise the flash-point so as to ensure that, resulting from its transportation, after its entry into free circulation, in tanks which may be contaminated or following the addition of kerosene to increase its fluidity, the flash-point of the finished product does not fall below 55 oC which is the minimum generally required for marketing the product as a gas oil, shall be classified in the combined nomenclature, as follows:\n\u2018\u2014 Heavy oils:\n\u2014 \u2014 Gas oils:\n2710\u00a000\u00a069 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 For other purposes\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 21st day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 February 1990.\nFor the Commission\nChristiane SCRIVENER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 256, 7. 9. 1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 374, 22. 12. 1989, p. 2."}
