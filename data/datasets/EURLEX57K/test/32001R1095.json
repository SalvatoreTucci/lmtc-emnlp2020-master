The rules for applying that quota for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 should be laid down.\n(2) There should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quota for all interested traders within the Community and of uninterrupted application of the customs duties laid down for the quota to all imports of the animals in question until the quota is used up.\n(3) The requirements of certain Member States which have a shortfall of bovine animals for fattening should be taken into account. As those requirements are particularly evident in Italy and Greece, priority must be given to satisfying demand in those two Member States.\n(4) For the allocation of the quota the method provided for in the third indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should be applied to the quantities allocated to Italy and Greece, avoiding any discrimination between the traders concerned. Access to the quota should therefore be widened to include \"new arrivals\".\n(5) Checks of these criteria call for applications to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is entered in the value added tax (VAT) register. Italy and Greece are an exception to this rule: traders entered in the VAT register of another Member State may submit their applications in these two countries.\n(6) In order to prevent speculation:\n- traders no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 June 2001 should be denied access to the quota,\n- a security should be fixed for import rights,\n- licences should not be transferable,\n- import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(7) To oblige traders to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that this obligation is a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(4).\n(8) With a view to using up quota quantities completely, a closing date should be set for the submission of import licence applications and provision should be made for a further allocation of quantities not covered by licence applications submitted by that date. In the light of experience it should also be laid down that this final allocation is open only to importers who have applied for import licences for the total quantity to which they are entitled.\n(9) Provision should be made for the arrangements to be managed using import licences. To that end rules should be laid down in particular on the way applications are to be submitted and the information to be shown in applications and licences, where applicable by waiving or supplementing certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for certain agricultural products(5) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 24/2001(7).\n(10) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of imports. The animals must accordingly be fattened in the Member State which issues the import licence.\n(11) A security must be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question.\n(12) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1.

Any import of animals for which import rights have been allocated shall be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2.
