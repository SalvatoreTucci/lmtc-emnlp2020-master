Addition of polydextrose (E 1200) can contribute to the body and mouthfeel and at the same time can provide the necessary foam stability. In addition, polydextrose (E 1200) has a low caloric value and its addition will have a limited contribution to the total calorie content of the beer.\n(6) Polydextrose (E 1200) belongs to the group of additives for which no acceptable daily intake has been specified\u00a0(3). This implies that it does not represent a hazard to health at the levels necessary to achieve the desired technological effect. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of polydextrose (E 1200) in energy-reduced and low-alcohol beers.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of polydextrose (E 1200) in energy-reduced and low-alcohol beers constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of polydextrose (E 1200) in beer before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of that food additive.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Report from the Commission on Dietary Food Additive Intake in the European Union, COM(2001) 542 final.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0295, 12.11.2011, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entry is inserted in the food category 14.2.1 \u2018beer and malt beverages\u2019 after the entry for E 1105:\n\u2018E 1200 Polydextrose quantum satis  Only energy-reduced and low-alcohol beers Period of application:"}
