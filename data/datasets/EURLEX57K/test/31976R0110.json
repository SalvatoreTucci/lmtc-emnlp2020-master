whereas to this end the supply situation and prices for those products within the Community and prices ruling in international trade must be taken into account; whereas provision should be made for the possibility of any coefficients that may be fixed being taken into account when the amount of the refund on fishery products is being calculated;\nWhereas if price trends are to be noted prices must be determined in accordance with general principles; whereas to this end prices on third country markets and in countries of destination, producer prices recorded in third countries and free-at-Community-frontier prices should be taken into account when prices on the world market are being determined; whereas prices ruling on the representative markets of the Community and prices ruling on exportation should be used as a basis in determining Community prices;\nWhereas provision must be made for varying the amount of the refund according to the destination of the products, in view of the special conditions which apply to imports in certain countries of destination;\nWhereas fish caught by Community producers is of Community origin even if it is landed in ports situated outside the customs territory of the Community; whereas, however, to make verification possible, refunds should be granted only in respect of fish landed in ports situated within the customs territory of the Community as defined by Regulation (EEC) No 1496/68\u00a0(2), as amended by the Act of Accession\u00a0(3);\nWhereas to ensure Community exporters some stability in the amount of the refund and certainty with regard to the list of products eligible for a refund, it should be possible for the list and the amounts to remain valid for a relatively long period, which would be determined in accordance with normal trade practice;\nWhereas to avoid distortions of competition between Community traders, the administrative conditions under which they operate must be identical throughout the Community; whereas there is no justification for granting a refund where the products in question are imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down general rules for fixing and granting export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 100/76.", "The following shall be taken into account when refunds are being fixed:\n(a) the existing situation and the future trend with regard to:\n\u2014 prices and availabilities of fishery products on the Community market,\n\u2014 prices for fishery products on the world market;\n(b) the aims of the common organization of the market in fishery products, which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market;\n(c) the minimum marketing and transport costs from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the markets of the countries of destination;
