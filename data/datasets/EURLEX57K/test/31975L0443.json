PRESENCE\nAll vehicles must be fitted with speedometer equipment. This will not be required for vehicles which are manufactured with recording equipment, the design characteristics and installation of which comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1463/70 (1) of 20 July 1970 on the introduction of recording equipment in road transport.\n2. DEFINITIONS\nFor the purpose of this Directive:      2.1. \"Vehicle type with regard to the speedometer equipment\" means vehicles which do not differ in the following essential respects:        2.1.1. tyres normally fitted;\n2.1.2. overall transmission ratio including reduction drive if fitted (number of revolutions at the speedometer input per revolution of the axle driving the speedometer equipment when vehicle is travelling in a straight line);\n2.1.3. type(s) of speedometer equipment ; the type shall be defined by the tolerance of the measuring mechanism of the speedometer, the instrument constant and the range of indicated speeds;\n2.2. \"tyres normally fitted\" means the type or types of tyre provided by the manufacturer on the vehicle type in question and specified in the information document annexed to Directive No 70/156/EEC ; snow tyres shall not be regarded as tyres normally fitted;\n2.3. \"normal running pressure\" means the cold inflation pressure specified by the vehicle manufacturer increased by 0 72 bar;\n2.4. \"speedometer\" means that part of the speedometer equipment which indicates to the driver the speed of his vehicle at any given moment.

Applications for EEC type-approval of a vehicle type with regard to the speedometer equipment shall be submitted by the vehicle manufacturer or by his duly appointed representative.\n3.2. It shall be accompanied by the following documents in triplicate and the following information:        3.2.1. description of the vehicle type with regard to the speedometer equipment;\n3.2.2. details of tyres normally fitted;\n3.2.3. ratio of the speedometer equipment.\n3.3. For the test described in section 5 below, a representative vehicle of the type to be approved shall be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the approval tests.\n4. SPECIFICATIONS     4.1. The speedometer display shall be situated in the driver's direct field of vision and shall be clearly legible both by day and by night. The range of speeds indicated must be large enough to include the maximum speed given by the manufacturer for the type of vehicle.\n4.2. Where the speedometer has a scale, as distinct from a digital display, it shall be clearly legible.      4.2.1. The graduations shall be of 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h. The values of the speed, multiples of 20 km/h, shall be indicated on the dial.\n4.2.2. In the case of a speedometer manufactured for sale in any Member State where imperial units of measurement are used, and where transitional arrangements in accordance with Article 5 are in force, the speedometer shall be marked both in km/h and in mph (miles per hour) ; the graduations shall be of 1, 2, 5 or 10 km/h and also of 1, 2, 5 or 10 mph and the values of the speed indicated on the dial shall be multiples of 20 km/h and multiples of 20 mph.\n4.3. The accuracy of the speedometer equipment shall be tested in accordance with the following procedure:      4.3.1. the vehicle is equipped with one of the types of tyre normally fitted ; the test shall be repeated for each of the types of speedometer specified by the manufacturer;\n4.3.2. the load on the axle driving the speedometer equipment must correspond to the weight complying with 2.6 of Annex I to Directive No 70/156/EEC;\n4.3.3. the reference temperature at the speedometer shall be 23 \u00b1 5\u00ba C;\n4.3.4. during each test the pressure of the tyres shall be the normal running pressure as defined in 2.3;\n4.3.5. the vehicle is tested at the following three speeds : 40, 80 and 120 km/h, or 80 % of the maximum speed specified by the manufacturer, if this is inferior to 150 km/h;\n4.3.6. the test instrumentation used for measuring the true vehicle speed shall be accurate to \u00b1 1.0 %;\n4.3.6.1. the surface of a test track when used be flat and dry, and shall provide sufficient adhesion.\n4.4. The speed indicated must never be less than the true speed. At the speeds specified for the test in 4.3.5 above and between these speeds, there shall be the following relationship between the speed indicated on the dial of the speedometer (V1) >PIC FILE= \"T0007661\">"}
