In addition, the applicant claimed that although it is related to certain producers of certain iron or steel fasteners located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, its relationships with its related companies in the People\u2019s Republic of China had been established before the imposition of the measures in force, and that these relationships have not been used to circumvent the measures in force as extended.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initiation of a partial interim review\n(7) On 14 May 2013, having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the request contained sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission initiated a partial interim review pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 13(4) of the basic Regulation by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union\n\u00a0(5) (\u2018the Notice of initiation\u2019). That partial interim review was limited to the examination of the possibility of granting an exemption from the measures in force as extended to the applicant.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interested parties\n(8) The Commission officially informed the applicant, the representatives of Malaysia and the People\u2019s Republic of China and the association of Union producers about the initiation of the partial interim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to a request a hearing within the time limit set in the Notice of initiation. Only the applicant came forward. No hearing has been requested.\n(9) In order to obtain the information deemed necessary for its investigation, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant, who did not provide any reply within the deadline set for that purpose.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(10) On 18 June 2013, the applicant withdrew its request for the partial interim review of the measures in force as extended. The applicant claimed that it was not able to provide the Commission with the data requested in the questionnaire as regards its related companies. Furthermore, the applicant complained that the deadline for submitting the questionnaire reply was too short. However, no substantiated request for an extension of the time limit for submitting the reply to the questionnaire has been made.\n(11) In view of the withdrawal, it was considered whether it would be warranted to continue the review investigation ex officio. The Commission found that no compelling reasons existed which would lead to the conclusion that termination would not be in the Union interest. On this basis, the review investigation should be terminated.\n(12) Interested parties were informed of the intention to terminate the review investigation and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received.\n(13) It is therefore concluded that the partial interim review concerning the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, as extended to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not, should be terminated without amending the anti-dumping measures in force as extended,", "main_body": ["The partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners originating in the People's Republic of China, as extended to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not, initiated pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 is hereby terminated without amending the anti-dumping measures in force as extended.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 22 October 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
