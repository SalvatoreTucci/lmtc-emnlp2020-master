That review is to result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.\n(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/179/EC of 17 February 1999 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to footwear(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Decision 2001/832/EC(3) should be modified.\n(5) A new Commission Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.\n(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 12 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria established by Decision 1999/179/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products, prior to the date of application of this Decision, to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,", "main_body": ["In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, footwear must fall within the product group \"footwear\" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "The product group \"footwear\" shall comprise:\nAll articles of clothing designed to protect or cover the foot, with a fixed outer sole which comes into contact with the ground.", "For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group \"footwear\" shall be \"017\".", "Article 3 of Decision 1999/179/EC is replaced by the following: \"The product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 March 2003.\"", "This Decision shall apply from 1 April 2002 until 31 March 2006. If on 31 March 2006 revised criteria have not been adopted, this Decision shall apply until 31 March 2007.\nProducers of products falling within the product group \"footwear\" which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 April 2002 may continue to use that label until 31 March 2003.\nProducers of products falling within the product group \"footwear\" which have already applied for the award of the eco-label before 1 April 2002 may be awarded the eco-label under the terms Decision 1999/179/EC until 31 March 2003.\nFrom 1 April 2002, new applications for the award of the eco-label for the product group \"footwear\" shall satisfy the criteria set out in this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 March 2002.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 57, 5.3.1999, p. 31.\n(3) OJ L 310, 28.11.2001, p. 30.\nANNEX\nFRAMEWORK\nThe aims of the criteria\nThese criteria aim in particular at:\n- limiting the levels of toxic residues,\n- limiting the emissions of volatile organic compounds, and\n- promoting a more durable product.\nThe criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of footwear which has a lower environmental impact.\nAssessment and verification requirements\nThe specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion.\nWhere appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application.\nThe functional unit is one pair of shoes.
