However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.\n(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.\n(6) Mebendazole should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(7) Tosylchloramide sodium should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 60th day following its publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 205, 31.7.2001, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 317, 6.11.1981, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 139, 10.6.2000, p. 25.\nANNEX\nA.
