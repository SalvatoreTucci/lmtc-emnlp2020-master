Conversion, diversification, including extensification of production, cost reduction and protection of the rural environment:\n- introduction of improved crop varieties and new varieties of out-of-season products and by-products, in particular to increase their added value,\n- alternative livestock production systems, involving in particular goats, sheep, suckler cows, equidae and game, with the aim of avoiding surpluses,\n- improvement of the profitability of farm woodland, development of integrated forestry-livestock systems and identification of potential alternative undergrowth crops,\n- improved integrated biological control, reduction and improvement of the use of fertilizers, fungicides, weedkillers and pesticides in production systems,\n- development of alternative farming practices, particularly organic farming with the aim of conserving natural resources and the countryside,\n- measures to support the development of the common agricultural structures policy by providing the basic data necessary for its conception, evaluation and management,\n- definition of the options for alternative use of land withdrawn from agricultural production in environmentally sensitive areas by recourse to land and water management systems.\n2. Product quality, new uses for traditional agricultural products and plant and animal health aspects:\n- definition, assessment and determination of quality in agricultural products where market opportunities might exist, especially where there are possibilities for higher added value,\n- pre and post-harvesting techniques, including transfer and storage, to improve quality,\n- effects of residues, toxins and other noxious substances occuring in agricultural products,\n- pre-packaging preparation and packaging methods for agricultural products to ensure better quality and environmental safety,\n- detecting and controlling crop and animal diseases that threaten the Community and improving the welfare of farm animals,\n- new uses for traditional products and ways of improving their quality. 3. Socio-economic aspects and specific activities for all regions lagging behind in development:\n- assessment of the structural, social and economic consequences of applying Community policies in these regions,\n- investigation of constraints on development in these regions and orientation of subsequent research and development activities,\n- specific regional problems arising from conversion, diversification and extensification of crop and animal production,\n- specific regional problems arising from conversion into woodland and forest production,\n- specific regional measures to overcome the problems posed by the unsatisfactory composition, excess and/or shortage of water,\n- measures to improve agricultural mechanization in specific regions,\n- integrated rural development.\n4. Methods and services to disseminate agricultural research information, particularly information gleaned from this programme:\n- integration of Community Agricultural Research Information Systems to improve access and to disseminate their results, and development of services to meet the requirements of the common agricultural policy and the needs of rural society,\n- development of agricultural information technology to avoid duplication, improve the quality of agricultural research in the Community and increase its added value,\n- application of computers and computer modelling to agricultural production systems to improve the identification of research areas and the information requirements of Community programmes.\nIMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES\nThe programme shall consist of activities implemented by means of shared-cost research contracts awarded following a selection procedure based on invitations to tender published in the Official Journal of the European Communites. Participants may be public or private bodies such as research institutions and universities, industrial and agricultural enterprises, natural persons, associations or cooperatives, or combinations thereof established in the Community.\nFor shared-cost contracts, the Community contribution shall not normally exceed 50% of the total expenditure. Alternatively in respect of universities and research establishments carrying out projects under this programme, the Community may bear up to 100% of the additional expenditure involved. Contracts should normally be carried out by participants from more than one Member State.\nThe programme shall also comprise coordinated activities and training and mobility grants. Meetings, seminars, workshops and grants shall be publicized in order to promote participation and to ensure the widest possible dissemination of results within the Community.\nIn implementing the programme, the Commission shall ensure close coordination with other Community research activities, in particular, the ongoing programmes involving agriculture, biotechnology and the environment.\nEVALUATION\nThe Commission communication to the Council concerning a Community plan of action relating to the evaluation of Community research and development activities for the year 1987-1991 (1) states that the objectives of each research programme have to be set out in a testable form.\nThe overall objective of this programme is to stregthen the competitiveness of agriculture and the management of agricultural resources. The programme responds to the needs of the common agricultural policy and of rural society. The programme aims to achieve greater economic and social cohesion and the protection of the environment.\nThe specific objectives are defined at the beginning of this Annex.\nAfter the second year of implementation, the programme will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:\n1. whether new research has been conducted in selected agricultural production systems to improve the outlets, and whether there are indications that the results of this research have any benefits;\n2. whether new research on quality has resulted in superior products, healthier crops and animals;\n3. whether, for regions lagging behind in development, additional research has identified the constraints, how to begin to overcome the difficulties and how some specific actions might improve the economic and social cohesion of these regions;\n4. whether, in addition to the better use of the Inventory of Agricultural Research Products (AGREP) and EUR-AGRIS network, development has taken place to assist the use of the new technology to improve the dissemination of the results of agricultural research, particularly those gleaned from this programme;\n5. whether the coordination activities are consistent with the objectives of the programme, whether they add to its utility and impact, and to the value of the important national research programmes in the Member States, whether they are being widely promoted and appropriately monitored;\n6. whether the work has been complementary and coordinated with other Community actions.\nAt the end of the programme, the evaluation will be carried out on the basis of the abovementioned and following criteria:\n1. whether the results obtained from this specific Community research programme might contribute solutions to some major problems encountered by the common agricultural policy;\n2. whether in exploiting biological resources for the use of Community agriculture, the competitiveness of Community agriculture is enhanced, resources are well-managed, harmful effects on health and the environment are reduced and greater attention is accorded to protection and enhancement of nature and rural society;\n3. whether the programme has produced added value attributable to the multinational character of the shared-cost and coordinated actions and has enabled duplication of research to be avoided;\n4. whether the applicable results have been examined in terms of their ecological, structural, social and economic consequences;\n5. whether the dissemination of results has contributed to the transfer of research methodologies and activities to regions in which the research was not conducted;\n6. whether adequate consideration has been given to all the selection criteria set out in Annex III to Decision 87/516/Euratom, EEC.\n(1) OJ No C 14, 20. 1. 1987, p. 5.\nANNEX II\nINDICATIVE INTERNAL ALLOCATION OF FUNDS\n1.2 //  // (%)   // I.
