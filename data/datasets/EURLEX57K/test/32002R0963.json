Measures are normally imposed for a 5-year period in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic anti-dumping Decision. However, some of these measures will not, at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, have reached the end of that 5-year period (ECSC anti-dumping measures). Some investigations, initiated pursuant to the basic anti-dumping Decision, may also be pending at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (pending anti-dumping investigations). Similarly, complaints or other applications for the initiation of an investigation filed pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Decision may be pending at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (pending anti-dumping applications).\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to provide for the continued application of ECSC anti-dumping measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (basic anti-dumping Regulation)(2) after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and to apply from then onwards the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Regulation to such measures. Any pending anti-dumping investigation should, after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, be continued and concluded pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and any anti-dumping measures resulting from such an investigation should be subject to the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Regulation. Similarly, after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, pending anti-dumping applications should be dealt with pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Regulation.\n(5) In this context, it should be noted that the provisions of the basic anti-dumping Decision are, with the exception of those on the Community's decision-making procedure, practically identical to those of the basic anti-dumping Regulation.\n(6) The Commission has also adopted a number of countervailing measures pursuant to Commission Decision No 1889/98/ECSC on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Coal and Steel Community (basic anti-subsidy Decision)(3). Measures are normally imposed for a 5-year period in accordance with Article 18(1) of the basic anti-subsidy Decision. However, some of these measures will not, at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, have reached the end of that 5-year period (ECSC countervailing measures). Some investigations, initiated pursuant to the basic anti-subsidy Decision, may also be pending at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (pending anti-subsidy investigations). Similarly, complaints or other applications for the initiation of an investigation filed pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Decision may be pending at the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty (pending anti-subsidy applications).\n(7) It is therefore also appropriate to provide for the continued application of ECSC countervailing measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (basic anti-subsidy Regulation)(4) after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and to apply from then onwards the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation to such measures. Any pending anti-subsidy investigation should after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty be continued and concluded pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation and any countervailing measures resulting from such an investigation should be subject to the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. Similarly, after the date of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, pending anti-subsidy applications should be dealt with pursuant to the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.\n(8) In this context, it should be noted that the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy Decision are, with the exception of those on the Community's decision making procedure, practically identical to those of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
