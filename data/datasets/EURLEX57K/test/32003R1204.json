A number of municipalities within and bordering on the specified provinces in the geographical area with a proven tradition of production of \"Caciocavallo Silano\" cheese have been included.\n- Method of production:\nIt is permitted to use natural whey inoculum prepared in the same production facility as the milk so as to maintain the organoleptic properties of the product. The minimum maturing period is increased to 30 days in order to ensure the quality of the cheese. In addition, the surface of the cheese may be given a colourless, transparent treatment that does not affect the colour of the rind.\nThe treatment does not impair the specific character or quality of the cheese but considerably increases its shelf-life by preventing damage caused by yeast and/or mould on the rind.\n- Labelling:\nThe PDO must bear a thermally impressed identification number allocated by the Consorzio di tutela formaggio Caciocavallo Silano (Association for the Protection of Caciocavallo Silano Cheese) to each producer covered by the inspection system, which permits each PDO product marketed to be traced. In addition, the colour of the mark is stipulated and the mark itself is amended to make the PDO logo more visible and more easily identified.\n- National requirements:\nReferences to national rules in force before the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 are deleted."}
