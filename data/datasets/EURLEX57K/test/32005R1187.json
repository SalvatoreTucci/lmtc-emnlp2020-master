This has made their use for a survey covering the most relevant part of the agricultural activity no longer necessary. It is therefore indicated to raise the threshold from 8 ESU to 16 ESU.\n(3) In the case of Cyprus, the threshold set initially to 1 ESU should be raised to 2 ESU, because the holdings with an economic size smaller than 2 ESU represent only 7\u00a0% of the total standard gross margin. The most relevant part of the agricultural activity can therefore be covered with a threshold excluding the smaller holdings.\n(4) The number of returning holdings per Member State to be selected by division is fixed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82. In the case of Spain, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Finland, the number of returning holdings has remained the same for a long time despite the significant reduction in the number of holdings. The reduction has been accompanied by an increase in the uniformity of the holdings, which is such that it enables satisfactory representation to be achieved on the basis of a smaller sample than the current one. Due to this structural change the number of returning holdings to be selected in Spain, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Finland can be reduced. However, for some divisions in Spain and Italy that number should be increased as a result of improved statistical methodologies used for the selection.\n(5) The number of returning holdings in Malta should be revised based on new information concerning its agricultural structure.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 is amended as follows:\n1.
