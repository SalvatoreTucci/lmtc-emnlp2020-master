The interim evaluation of the agency has shown that it holds sound productivity indicators and performs its technical and financial management to the satisfaction of stakeholders. The agency has successfully contributed to the implementation of the trans-European transport network programme and has allowed the Commission to focus on and improve the management of its policy and institutional tasks. The interim evaluation has also shown that the agency is a more cost-efficient option for the management of the trans-European transport network programme, as compared to the Commission in-house management scenario. Savings resulting from the delegation of tasks to the agency have been estimated at some EUR 8,66 million over the period of years 2008 to 2015.\n(7) In its Communication of 29 June 2011\u2018A budget for Europe 2020\u2019\u00a0(4), the Commission proposed to use the option of more extensive recourse to existing executive agencies for the implementation of Union programmes in the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.\n(8) The cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that delegation to the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency of the management of parts of the Connecting Europe Facility programme in the fields of transport, energy and telecommunications\u00a0(5), as well as parts of transport and energy research under the Horizon 2020 programme\u00a0(6), would make it possible to implement such programmes efficiently at a lower cost than in the Commission. Such delegation of programme management to the agency is estimated to deliver efficiency gains in the order of EUR 54 million over the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework. The analysis has also shown that bringing together the management of infrastructure and research projects in the fields of transport and energy in the same agency would result in significant economies of scale and synergies between such activities. The extension of the agency\u2019s mandate would allow the Commission and stakeholders to benefit from the agency\u2019s expertise and high quality of programme management and service delivery. It would also ensure business continuity for the beneficiaries of the trans-European transport network programme and a high level of visibility of the Union as the promoter of the programmes managed by the agency. In addition, the analysis has also shown that for the trans-European transport network\u00a0(7) and Marco Polo\u00a0(8) programmes the return to an in-house management arrangement would be disruptive and result in efficiency losses.\n(9) In order to give executive agencies a coherent identity, the Commission has, as far as possible, grouped work by thematic policy areas in establishing their new mandates.\n(10) The new agency should hold an extended mandate covering the management of parts of the following programmes:\n\u2014 the new programme Connecting Europe Facility; the management of this programme involves implementation of technical projects which do not entail political decision-making and requires a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 parts of Part III Societal Challenges of the Horizon 2020 Specific Programme; the management of this programme involves implementation of technical projects which do not entail political decision-making and requires a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 the legacy of the trans-European transport network programme, which was already delegated to the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency under the 2000-2006 Multiannual Financial Framework (as of 2007) and the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework; the management of this programme involves implementation of technical projects which do not entail political decision-making and requires a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 the legacy of the Marco Polo programme, which under the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework has been managed by the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation; the management of this programme involves implementation of technical projects which do not entail political decision-making and requires a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle.\n(11) In order to ensure a consistent implementation in time of this Decision and of the programmes concerned, it is necessary to ensure that the Agency shall exercise its tasks linked to the implementation of those programmes subject to and from the date on which those programmes enter into force.\n(12) The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency should be established. It should replace and succeed the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency established by Decision 2007/60/EC as amended by Decision 2008/593/EC. It should operate in accordance with the general statute laid down by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.\n(13) Decision 2007/60/EC and Decision 2008/593/EC should therefore be repealed and transitional provisions should be set out.\n(14) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Establishment\nThe Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agency\u2019) is hereby established from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2024.\nThe statute of the Agency shall be governed by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.\nThe Agency shall replace and succeed the executive agency set up by Decision 2007/60/EC as amended by Decision 2008/593/EC.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Brussels.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency is hereby entrusted with the implementation of parts of the following Union programmes:\n(a) Connecting Europe Facility;\n(b) Part III Societal Challenges of the Horizon 2020 Specific Programme.\nThis paragraph shall apply subject to and as from the date of the entry into force of each of these programmes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency is hereby entrusted with the implementation of the legacy of the following programmes:\n(a) trans-European transport network programme;\n(b) Marco Polo programme.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be responsible for the following tasks related to the implementation of the parts of the Union programmes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:\n(a) managing some stages of programme implementation and some phases in the lifetime of specific projects on the basis of the relevant work programmes adopted by the Commission, where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation;\n(b) adopting the instruments of budget execution for revenue and expenditure and carrying out all the operations necessary for the management of the programme, where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation;\n(c) providing support in programme implementation where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation.", "Duration of the appointments\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The members of the Steering Committee shall be appointed for 2 years.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Director shall be appointed for 5 years.", "Supervision and reporting requirement\nThe Agency shall be subject to supervision by the Commission and shall report regularly on progress in implementing the Union programmes or parts thereof for which it is responsible in accordance with the arrangements and at the intervals stipulated in the instrument of delegation.", "Implementation of the operating budget\nThe Agency shall implement its operating budget in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1653/2004\u00a0(9).", "Repeal and transitional provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decision 2007/60/EC as amended by Decision 2008/593/EC is repealed with effect from 1 January 2014.
