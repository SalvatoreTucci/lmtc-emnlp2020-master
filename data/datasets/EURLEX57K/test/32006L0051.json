Therefore, it is considered that, at this stage, gas engines and vehicles fuelled with gas should be exempted from the requirements to ensure correct operation of NOx control measures. The exemption might be revoked when taking into consideration further emission stages.\n(6) It is appropriate to adjust the date of application of sections 6.5.3, 6.5.4 and 6.5.5 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC in case of new type approvals.\n(7) The Commission intends to review the OBD threshold limit values in order to adapt them to the technological progress.\n(8) Directives 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.", "Annex IV to Directive 2005/78/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 8 November 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
