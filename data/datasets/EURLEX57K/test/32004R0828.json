At its 2001 annual meeting it recommended the lifting of the prohibition of imports of Atlantic swordfish in any form, imposed by the contracting parties on Honduras.\n(7) ICCAT has taken note of the strengthening of cooperation with Belize for the conservation of Atlantic swordfish. At its 2003 annual meeting it lifted, as of 1 January 2004, the prohibition of imports of Atlantic swordfish in any form, imposed by the contracting parties on Belize.\n(8) ICCAT's attempts to encourage Sierra Leone to comply with measures for the conservation and management of Atlantic swordfish have been to no avail.\n(9) ICCAT has recommended its contracting parties to take appropriate steps to ban imports of these products in any form from Sierra Leone. These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the country in question has brought its fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures. These measures should therefore be implemented by the Community, which has sole competence in the matter.\n(10) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements.\n(11) For the sake of transparency, Regulation (EC) No 2093/2000 should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Regulation,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, \"importation\" means the customs procedures referred to in Articles 4(15)(a), (15)(b) and (16)(a) to (16)(f) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code.(2)", "1.
