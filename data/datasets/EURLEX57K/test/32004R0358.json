Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provide that the production refund applying to raw sugar, sucrose syrups and unprocessed isoglucose is to be derived from the refund fixed for white sugar in accordance with a method of calculation specific to each basic product.\n(3) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provides that the production refund on white sugar is to be fixed at monthly intervals commencing on the first day of each month. It may be adjusted in the intervening period where there is a significant change in the prices for sugar on the Community and/or world markets. The application of those provisions results in the production refund fixed in Article 1 of this Regulation for the period shown.\n(4) As a result of the amendment to the definition of white sugar and raw sugar in Article 1(2)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, flavoured or coloured sugars or sugars containing any other added substances are no longer deemed to meet those definitions and should thus be regarded as \"other sugar\". However, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001, they attract the production refund as basic products. A method should accordingly be laid down for calculating the production refund on these products by reference to their sucrose content.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The production refund on white sugar referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 shall be equal to 46,511 EUR/100 kg net.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 March 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 February 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.
