The co-responsibility levy referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 shall be payable on cereals where they:\n- enter into first-stage processing, or\n- are taken over by intervention agencies, or\n- are exported as grain to Portugal during the first stage or to third countries; 'export' shall mean the completion of customs export formalities.\nWhen determining the quantities subject to the levy by virtue of first-stage processing, account shall be taken of the quantities of cereals entering the undertaking with a view to such processing.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation, 'first-stage processing' shall mean any treatment of grain such that the product obtained may no longer be classified under Chapter 10 of the Common Customs Tariff. Processing of cereals delivered or placed at the disposal of an undertaking by a producer with a view to subsequent utilization on his holding shall be considered first-stage processing.\nFirst-stage processing operations carried out by a producer on his agricultural holding shall be exempt from the co-responsibility levy where the product obtained is used on that holding for animal feed.", "1. The levy shall be paid by operators who undertake processing within the meaning of Article 1 (2). The levy shall be paid to the competent body appointed for the purpose by each Member State, in respect of processing operations carried out in one month. Payment must be made by the end of the month following the said period at the latest. On each payment, a declaration in writing in accordance with the model set out in the Annex shall be forwarded to the competent authority.\n2. In the case of intervention, the co-responsibility levy shall be collected at the time of payment of the buying-in price by the intervention agency.\n3. In the case of export as grain, the co-responsibility levy shall be collected by the competent authorities by the end of the month following that in which export formalities are completed at the latest.\n4. Before the 15th of each month, Member States shall notify the Commission of sums collected during the previous month, indicating the corresponding quantities of cereals subject to the co-responsibility levy.", "The co-responsibility levy may be collected once only in respect of one and the same quantity of cereals.\nIn the case of resale of intervention stocks, the intervention agency shall issue a certificate of eligibility for exemption from the co-responsibility levy for given quantities. Extracts of that certificate may be issued.", "Cereals imported from third countries or from Portugal and processed or re-exported to third countries or to Portugal shall be exempt from the co-responsibility levy. That exemption shall be depending upon submission of evidence that the product processed or re-exported is the same as the product previously imported.", "1. Operators who carry out the operations referred to in Article 1 (1) shall pass on the co-responsibility levy to their suppliers. The levy shall also be passed on at each transaction prior thereto, as far as supply by the producer.\nSupporting documents for each of the transactions referred to in the first subparagraph shall indicate separately the amount of the levy deducted.\n2. The levy shall also be passed on, as provided for in paragraph 1, in contracts concluded or executed prior to the marketing year during which the co-responsibility levy is collected.", "The operators referred to in Article 2 (1) shall keep accounts at the disposal of the competent national authority, indicating in particular:\n(a) the names and addresses of the producers or operators who delivered cereal to them as grain;\n(b) the quantities involved in the abovementioned deliveries;\n(c) the amount of the co-responsibility levy deducted;\n(d) the quantities of cereals processed, subject to and exempt from the levy.", "1.
