Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the microorganism preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MUCL 39885) was provisionally authorised for the first time for dairy cows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 879/2004\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that microorganism preparation for dairy cows. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that microorganism preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the microorganism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (DSM 10663/NCIMB 10415) was provisionally authorised for the first time for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1801/2003\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that microorganism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that microorganism preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(7) The use of the microorganism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (DSM 10663/NCIMB 10415) was provisionally authorised for the first time for dogs by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that microorganism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that microorganism preparation, as specified in Annex III to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The use of the microorganism preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus (D2/CSL CECT 4529) was provisionally authorised for the first time for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that microorganism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that microorganism preparation, as specified in Annex IV to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.4 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI SD 142) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(7). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex V to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(10) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(8).\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Microorganisms\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Microorganisms\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Microorganisms\u2019, as specified in Annex III, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Microorganisms\u2019, as specified in Annex IV, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex V, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
