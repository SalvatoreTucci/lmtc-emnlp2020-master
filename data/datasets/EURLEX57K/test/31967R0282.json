To be accepted for intervention, oil seeds must be of sound and fair marketable quality.\n2. Intervention shall be restricted to: - colza and rape seed with a maximum of 2 % impurities and 10 % moisture;  (1) OJ No 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.

Samples shall be drawn and the moisture and impurities content of oil seeds determined by a single method in all Member States.\nHowever, until such methods are established, Member States may choose methods, of which they shall inform the Commission.\n2. The oil content shall be determined by the method laid down in Annex II. However, Member States may also use the method for determining the oil content of oil seeds laid down in ISO Recommendation No 900, using a microgrinder. In such cases for the purpose of applying the price increases and reductions, the quantity of oil found in the seeds shall be reduced by 400 grammes per 100 kilogrammes.", "1. All offers for sale by intervention must be made in writing to the intervention agency of the Member State in which the seeds are located.\n2.

Moisture content\nPrice increase of 0.007 units of account per 0.100 kg of moisture below 10 kg contained in 100 kg of seed.\n3. Impurities content\nPrice increase of 0.007 units of account per 0.100 kg of impurities below 2 kg contained in 100 kg of seed.\nANNEX II Method for determining oil content\nThe solvent used is light petroleum \"for determining fat content\" free from aromatic hydrocarbons and having a boiling point between 30 \u00baC and 50 \u00baC. This light petroleum should not leave a deposit at a temperature of 60 \u00baC. Its iodine value should be less than 1. A percolating apparatus is used for extraction (Twisselmann's apparatus, for example).\nAn average sample of at least 30 g of whole seed is carefully weighed and then passed through a sieve with 3 mm holes, and all impurities such as chaff, straw and cereals removed by hand ; the quantity of seed thus cleaned is then weighed and the percentage which it represents of the original sample is calculated. Two 5-gramme portions are immediately taken from the cleaned seed, weighed to the nearest 5 mg and subjected for one hour to preliminary drying at a temperature of 95 \u00baC in two separate extraction thimbles (if the moisture content is 10 % or less preliminary drying not necessary). The sample, mixed with at least 25 g fine quartz sand is then ground as finely as possible in a hand or mechanically operated mortar. This operation usually takes fifteen minutes.\nThe ground sample is then replaced without loss in the thimble. Extraction follows immediately after weighing, any preliminary drying and grinding, when the balloon flask which is to be used  to collect the extraction products and which forms part of the extraction apparatus has been dried and weighed to the nearest milligramme. Extraction lasts for four hours at boiling point. The thimble is then withdrawn from the apparatus, the solvent removed and the extracted material dried in a vacuum. The contents of the thimble are emptied into a mortar and ground again for ten minutes. They are then replaced in full in the thimble, and the latter in the apparatus, and extraction is repeated for two hours under the same conditions as before, using the same flask. The sample is ground under pressure and further fat content is carefully extracted until the residual content is equal to or less than 0.1 % The greater part of the solvent present in the extracted product contained in the flask is removed by distillation. The last traces are removed by raising the temperature to 100 \u00baC while ensuring that it does not exceed 105 \u00baC. The elimination of the solvent is completed either by blowing in air or carbon dioxide at intervals or by using a vacuum. After cooling it is then weighed. Heating and weighing are continued under the same conditions until the difference between two successive weighings is equal to or less than 0.01 g. The fat extracted should be clear ; if it is not, any impurities will be eliminated by dissolving in light petroleum and filtering. The filtered solution is then concentrated by evaporation and the remaining oil dried until it reaches a constant weight under the conditions described above.\nThe final weighing is the one which served as a basis for calculating the extracted fat. If precleaned seeds are used to determine the oil content, the result obtained should be compared with the original sample."}
