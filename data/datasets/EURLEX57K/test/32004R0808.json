This can be provided for by having modules with a fixed duration and by allowing for modification through implementing measures taking into consideration Member States' resources and the burden on respondents, technical and methodological feasibility and the reliability of results.\n(9) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics(2).\n(10) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on the information society, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3).\n(12) The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(4), has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 thereof,", "main_body": ["Objective\nThe objective of this Regulation shall be to establish a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on the information society.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n(a) \"Community statistics\" shall have the meaning assigned to it in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 322/97;\n(b) \"production of statistics\" shall have the meaning assigned to it in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 322/97;\n(c) \"reference period\" shall mean a period to which data refer;\n(d) \"reference year\" shall mean a reference period of one calendar year;\n(e) \"collection period\" shall mean a period specified in implementing measures during which a collection of data takes place.", "Scope\n1.
