The flash point shall be determined by using one of the following sets of apparatus:      (a) for use at temperatures not exceeding 50\u00ba C : Abel apparatus, Abel-Pensky apparatus, Luchaire-Finances apparatus, Tag apparatus;\n(b) for use at temperatures above 50\u00ba C : Pensky-Martens apparatus, Luchaire-Finances apparatus;\n(c) in the absence of the above, any closed-cup apparatus able to give a result which does not differ by more than 2\u00ba C from the result one of the above sets of apparatus would give.\n2. For the determination of the flash point of paints, glues or other products of similar viscosity containing solvents, only apparatus and methods may be used which are suitable for determining the flash point of viscous liquids such as:\nmethod A of the IP (1) 170/59 standards, the German standards DIN 53 213 p. 1, July 1970 edition, and TGL 14 301 p. 2.\nThe method of operation for the measurement shall be:     (a) with the Abel apparatus, the standard IP (1) 33/44 ; this standard can also be used with the Abel-Pensky apparatus;\n(b) with the Pensky-Martens apparatus, the standard IP (1) 34/64 or the standard D 93-66 of the ASTM (2);\n(c) with the Tag apparatus, the standard D 56/70 of the ASTM (2);\n(d) with the Luchaire apparatus, the standard annexed to the Decree of 26 October 1925 made by the French Minister of Trade and Industry, published in the Official Journal of 29 October 1925.\nWhen other equipment is used, the method of operation must include the following precautions:      1. The determination must take place under draught-free conditions.\n2. The liquid being tested must not be heated at a rate exceeding 5\u00ba C a minute.\n3. The length of the flame used must be 5 mm (\u00b1 0 75 mm).\n4. The flame must be applied to the mouth of the receptacle each time that there has been an increase of 1\u00ba C in the heat of the liquid.\nIn the event of a difference of opinion on the classification of a flammable liquid, the classification number proposed by the manufacturer or organization marketing the liquid shall be adopted, provided that a repeat determination of the flash point carried out on the liquid in question gives a value which does not differ by more than 2\u00ba C at the limits laid down (21\u00ba C and 55\u00ba C respectively). Should a repeat determination give a value which differs by more than 2\u00ba C at these limits, a second repeat determination must be performed, and the highest of the values recorded shall be finally adopted.
