As a participant it has to ensure that a certificate accompanies each shipment of rough diamonds imported into or exported from the territory of the Union.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002\u00a0(2) sets up a Union system of certification and import and export controls for rough diamonds for the purposes of implementing the KP certification scheme.\n(3) Greenland is not part of the Union territory but it is included in the list of overseas countries and territories set out in Annex II to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 198 TFEU, the purpose of the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union is to promote the economic and social development of the overseas countries and territories and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole.\n(4) Denmark and Greenland have requested to enable the participation of Greenland in the KP certification scheme on rough diamonds through its cooperation with the Union. Such cooperation would strengthen economic relations between the Union and Greenland in the diamond industry, and in particular it would enable Greenland to export rough diamonds accompanied by the EU Certificate issued for the purposes of the certification scheme, with a view to promoting the economic development of Greenland.\n(5) Trade in rough diamonds in Greenland should, therefore, be conducted in compliance with Union rules implementing the KP certification scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds. Accordingly, the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 will be extended by Regulation (EU) No 257/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) to the territory of Greenland for the purpose of the certification scheme.\n(6) In particular, Greenland should only export rough diamonds to other participants in the KP certification scheme after they have been certified by a Union authority listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002. Imports of rough diamonds into Greenland should also be verified by the Union authorities.\n(7) In order to permit the international trade in rough diamonds in Greenland, in accordance with the rules on trade within the Union, Greenland should undertake to transpose the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002 into the national law of Greenland so as to allow the application of this Decision,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Decision sets out the general rules and conditions for the participation of Greenland in the system of certification and import and export controls for rough diamonds set out in Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002.
