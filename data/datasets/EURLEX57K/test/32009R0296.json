Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2) The Community and the United States of America have agreed under the GATT to allow importation into the United States of cheese of Community origin subject to quota restrictions with effect from 1 January 1980. This agreement was approved by Council Decision 80/272/EEC\u00a0(4).\n(3) The United States of America has committed itself to take all necessary measures so that the management of the quota will be such as to permit its maximum utilisation. In the light of experience it appears to be appropriate to strengthen administrative cooperation with the United States of America to ensure that the quotas of certain cheeses of Community origin are fully utilised. The cheeses concerned should therefore be accompanied by a certificate issued by the competent authorities in the Community.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["For exportation to the United States of America (including Puerto Rico and Hawaii) of cheeses \u2018Swiss or Emmentaler cheese with eye formation\u2019 which fall within subheadings 0406.90.44 to 0406.90.48 of the Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States and are subject to quota restrictions, the competent authority of the exporting Member State shall issue, at the exporter\u2019s request, a certificate corresponding to the model in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forms referred to in Article 1\u00a0shall be printed on white paper of format 210\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0296 millimetres and shall be worded in English.
