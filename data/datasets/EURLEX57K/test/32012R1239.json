These limit values are all fixed by reference to three methods of chilling defined in Article 10 of that Regulation, namely air chilling, air-spray chilling and immersion chilling.\n(4) New technologies have given rise to the development of new chilling methods for which the same rules should apply as for the chilling methods defined in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 543/2008. Therefore, it is necessary to set down the limit values that will apply when new chilling methods are used.\n(5) Given that the new technologies for chilling poultry carcases are explored in order to improve the overall quality of poultrymeat, the limit values for these new chilling methods should not exceed the lowest limit values established for the air chilling method.\n(6) Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 543/2008 contains the list of national reference laboratories. The competent authorities of Malta have notified the Commission of the new designation of their national reference laboratory.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 543/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Annexes VI to IX and Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 543/2008 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 17.6.2008, p. 46.\nANNEX\nAnnexes VI to IX and Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 543/2008 are amended as follows:\n(1) in Annex VI, point 7 is replaced by the following:\nair chilling: 1,5\u00a0%,\nair spray chilling: 3,3\u00a0%,\nimmersion chilling: 5,1\u00a0%.\nother chilling method or a combination of two or more of the methods defined in Article 10: 1,5\u00a0%.\u2019;\n(2) in Annex VII, point 6 is replaced by the following:\n(a) The weight of water (W) in each carcase is given by aP1/100 and the weight of protein (RP) by bP1/100, both of which are expressed in grams. The sums of the weights of water (W7) and the weights of protein (RP7) in the seven carcases analysed are determined.\n(b) In the case of a composite sample analysis, the average content of water and protein from the two samples analysed is determined to give a % and b %, respectively. The weight of the water (W7) in the seven carcases is given by aP7/100, and the weight of protein (RP7) by bP7/100, both of which are expressed in grams.\n6.2. The average weight of water (WA) and protein (RPA) is calculated by dividing W7 and RP7, respectively, by seven.\n6.3. The theoretical physiological water content in grams as determined by this method may be calculated by the following formula:\n(a) Air chilling\n(b) Air-spray chilling\n(c) Immersion chilling\n(d) Other chilling methods or a combination of two or more of the methods defined in Article 10\n6.5. If the average water content (WA) of the seven carcases as calculated under point 6.2 does not exceed the value given in point 6.4 (WG), the quantity of poultry subjected to the check shall be considered up to standard.\n(3) in Annex VIII, point 6 is replaced by the following:\n(a) The weight of water (W) in each cut is given by aP1/100 and the weight of protein (RP) by bP1/100, both of which are expressed in grams.\n(b) In the case of a composite sample analysis, the average content of water and protein from the two samples analysed is determined to give a % and b %, respectively. The weight of the water (W5) in the five cuts is given by aP5/100, and the weight of protein (RP5) by bP5/100, both of which are expressed in grams.\n6.2. The average weight of water (WA) and protein (RPA) is calculated by dividing W5 and RP5 respectively, by five.\n6.3. The mean physiological W/RP ratio as determined by this method is as follows:\nchicken breast fillet: 3,19\u00a0\u00b1 0,12,\nchicken legs and leg quarters: 3,78\u00a0\u00b1 0,19,\nturkey breast fillet: 3,05\u00a0\u00b1 0,15,\nturkey legs: 3,58\u00a0\u00b1 0,15,\ndeboned turkey leg meat: 3,65\u00a0\u00b1 0,17.\n6.4. Assuming that the minimum technically unavoidable water content absorbed during preparation amounts to 2\u00a0%, 4\u00a0% or 6\u00a0%\u00a0(2) depending on the type of products and chilling methods applied, the highest permissible W/RP ratios as determined by this method are as follows:\nAir chilled Air-spray chilled Immersion chilled\nChicken breast fillet; without skin 3,40 3,40 3,40\nChicken breast; with skin 3,40 3,50 3,60\nChicken thighs, drumsticks, legs, legs with a portion of the back, leg quarters, with skin 4,05 4,15 4,30\nTurkey breast fillet; without skin 3,40 3,40 3,40\nTurkey breast, with skin 3,40 3,50 3,60\nTurkey thighs, drumsticks, legs, with skin 3,80 3,90 4,05\nDeboned turkey leg meat, without skin 3,95 3,95 3,95\n(4) in Annex IX, the following point 11 is added:\n\u201811. In cases where carcases are chilled with an other chilling method or a combination of two or more of the methods defined in Article 10, the maximum percentage of water content shall not exceed 0\u00a0% of the original weight of the carcase.\u2019;\n(5) in Annex XI, the entry concerning Malta is replaced by the following:\nMCCAA Laboratory Services Directorate\nStandards and Metrology Institute\nMalta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority\nF22, Mosta Technopark\nMosta MST3000\nMalta\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Calculated on the basis of the carcase, exclusive of absorbed extraneous water.;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Calculated on the basis of the cut, exclusive of absorbed extraneous water. For (skinless) fillet and deboned turkey leg meat, the percentage is 2\u00a0% for each of the chilling methods.\u2019;"}
