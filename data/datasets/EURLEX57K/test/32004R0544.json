These refund certificates are made available to operators in six tranches over the budget period, with deadlines for applications applying in respect of each tranche. Refund certificates may only be issued to applicants established in the European Union.\n(2) On the occasion of the forthcoming accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, operators in these new Member States may apply in the period from 1 to 7 May 2004 for refund certificates from the fifth tranche which will be valid for use from 1 June 2004. However, these operators will not have access to refund certificates issued from previous tranches and therefore will not have access to refund certificates valid for use in the period from 1 to 31 May 2004.\n(3) In circumstances where operators established in the new Member States will not have access to refund certificates valid in the period from 1 to 31 May 2004 it is appropriate to adopt special temporary measures exempting such operators from the requirement of presenting refund certificates in the period from 1 to 31 May 2004.\n(4) Accordingly, it is appropriate to make certain derogations from Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 so as to enable operators in new Member States to qualify, in the period from 1 to 31 May 2004, for the exemption provided by the said Article.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 is derogated from for the budgeting year ending 15 October 2004 as follows:\n1.
