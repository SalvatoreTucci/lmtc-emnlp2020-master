Pursuant to that Annex, for all species of animals other than those of family Suidae, the conditions for a territory to be considered free from bluetongue are that no case of disease was registered and no vaccination was carried out during the last 12\u00a0months with appropriate control of the Culicoides population.\n(5) In recent years, as a result of new technical developments, \u2018inactivated vaccines\u2019 against bluetongue have become available which do not pose the risk of undesired local circulation of the vaccine virus to unvaccinated cattle, sheep and goats. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for the control of bluetongue and for the prevention of clinical disease in such animals in the Union.\n(6) Accordingly, Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue\u00a0(2) was recently amended by Directive 2012/5/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), to provide for the use of inactivated vaccines in all parts of the EU.\n(7) As a result of the evolving epidemiological situation as regards bluetongue, and to align with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 of 26 October 2007 on implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue\u00a0(4) was amended recently. Consequently, EU standards require the absence of virus circulation for a minimum period of two years in order to consider a territory free from bluetongue. The period of 12\u00a0months referred to in Annex II to Directive 2004/68/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) Directive 2000/75/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 apply to intra-Union movements of live ungulates of species susceptible to bluetongue. It is appropriate that the basic general criteria for a territory of a third country to be considered free from bluetongue, as set out in Annex II to Directive 2004/68/EC, be aligned with the requirements applicable within the Union.\n(9) Annex II to Directive 2004/68/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 2004/68/EC, the entry for bluetongue is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Bluetongue no case of disease and no vaccination carried out during the last 24 months with appropriate control of the Culicoides population All species other than those of the genera Bos, Bison, Bubalus, Ovis and Capra and of the family Suidae\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a0321.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0327, 22.12.2000, p.\u00a074.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a081, 21.3.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0283, 27.10.2007, p.\u00a037."}
