Other indications may be derived from an analysis of the casualties involving ships classed by the recognised organisations.\n(4) Since recognised organisations operate all over the world, it is appropriate that their performance records are based on a sufficiently wide geographical area.\n(5) Both the United States Coast Guard and the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control periodically publish data based on port State control in a similar way to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. They should be considered comparably reliable sources in terms of continuity and accuracy of data from which to derive an assessment of the safety and pollution prevention performance records of recognised organisations.\n(6) The data published by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding and the United States Coast Guard are subject to prior appeal mechanisms, allowing the recognised organisations concerned to contest them. Those data should, therefore, be considered as sufficiently reliable sources and should be used for the establishment of the assessment criteria as to the safety and pollution prevention performance of recognised organisations.\n(7) Analysis of records on the detention of ships should, where such information is available, take specific account of recognised organisation-related detentions. It should also be designed in such a way as to reduce the risk that small and/or flag-specific populations, as may be the case of fleets classed by certain organisations with limited recognition, give rise to statistical distortions.\n(8) Data sources must be transparent, impartial and capable of providing sufficiently reliable, exhaustive and continuous data. Therefore, in the absence of sufficiently complete public sources, data on marine casualties may be obtained from commercial data sources and taken into consideration provided that reasonable assurance can be gained that the aforementioned criteria are met.\n(9) Reports produced by Member States on the basis of Article 12 of Directive 94/57/EC should also be taken into consideration in assessing the safety and pollution prevention performance records of the organisations.\n(10) A recognised organisation\u2019s safety and pollution prevention records, including other indications such as marine casualties, should be assessed with a view to allowing the adoption of fair and proportionate decisions based on the organisation\u2019s structural capacity to meet the highest professional standards. It is therefore necessary to compare these records over a reasonable period of time.\n(11) In order to guarantee the usefulness and fairness of the assessment system, it is necessary to allow a reasonable period of time for recognised organisations to take it into account in their management decisions, while at the same time giving the Commission the opportunity to evaluate its functioning and, as appropriate, make the necessary adjustments.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision:\n1. \u2018recognised organisation\u2019 means an organisation recognised in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 94/57/EC;\n2. \u2018Paris Memorandum of Understanding\u2019 (hereinafter Paris MOU) means the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, signed in Paris on 26 January 1982, as it stands at the date of adoption of this Decision;\n3. \u2018Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding\u2019 (hereinafter Tokyo MOU) means the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in the Asia Pacific Region, signed in Tokyo on 1 December 1993, as it stands at the date of adoption of this Decision;\n4. a \u2018recognised organisation-related detention\u2019 means that the ship\u2019s recognised organisation that carried out the relevant survey or that issued a certificate had a responsibility in relation to the deficiencies which, alone or in combination, led to detention, as defined in the applicable instructions of the relevant port State control scheme;\n5. a \u2018marine casualty\u2019 means a marine casualty as defined in IMO resolution A.\u00a0849(20).", "The criteria to be followed in order to decide when the performance of an organisation acting on behalf of a flag State can be considered an unacceptable threat to safety and the environment are set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission, in determining whether an organisation acting on behalf of a flag State must be considered an unacceptable threat to safety and the environment may, in addition to the criteria set out in Annex I, take into account the cases that come to its knowledge where:\n(a) it has been proven in a court of law or in an arbitration procedure that a marine casualty involving a ship in the class of a recognised organisation has been caused by a wilful act or omission or gross negligence of such recognised organisation, its bodies, employees, agents or others who act on its behalf;
