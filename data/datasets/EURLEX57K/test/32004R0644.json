Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2) specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.\n(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.\n(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.\n(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.\n(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(6) Pursuant to Regulations (EC) No 1039/2003(3), (EC) No 1086/2003(4), (EC) No 1087/2003(5), (EC) No 1088/2003(6), (EC) No 1089/2003(7) and (EC) No 1090/2003(8) the Council adopted autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to those countries. Those regulations provide that, from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic, shall not be eligible for export refunds.\n(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(9), from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.\n(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(10), from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta are not eligible for export refunds.\n(9) With a view to enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004, and in order to prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of products in receipt of export refunds, the setting of all remaining export refunds has been discontinued in the sugar sector, in relation to the products concerned when exported unprocessed to the acceding States.\n(10) Therefore, with effect from 7 April 2004 no refund should be set for certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Cyprus and Poland and for the goods which are not referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 when exported to Hungary.\n(11) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n(12) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and in Article 1(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, are fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "1.
