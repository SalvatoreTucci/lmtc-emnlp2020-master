The Agreement was approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision 2012/497/EU\u00a0(3).\n(2) The Agreement provides for new tariff quotas for agricultural and processed agricultural products originating in Morocco. It also provides for changes to existing tariff quotas for those products that are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 747/2001.\n(3) Furthermore, the Agreement no longer provides for tariff concessions applicable in the framework of reference quantities that are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 747/2001.\n(4) It is necessary to implement the new tariff quotas, the changes to the existing tariff quotas and the end of reference quantities, as provided for in the Agreement. Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) For the purpose of calculating the tariff quotas for the first year of application, provision should be made, in accordance with the Agreement, that the volumes of the tariff quotas for which the quota period began prior to the date of entry into force of the Agreement should be reduced by a proportion relating to that part of the period which had elapsed before that date.\n(6) The monthly use of the additional tariff quota that applies from 1 November to 31 May for imports into the European Union of fresh or chilled tomatoes originating in Morocco should, in accordance with the Agreement, be limited to 30\u00a0% of its initial volume of 28\u00a0000 tonnes net weight.\n(7) As the Agreement enters into force on 1 October 2012, this Regulation should apply from that date.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 3a is replaced by the following:\n(2) Annex II is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 September 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 2.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 241, 7.9.2012, p. 4.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 241, 7.9.2012, p. 2.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX II\nMOROCCO\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording for the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by the coverage of the CN codes as they exist in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011(OJ L 282, 28.10.2011, p. 1).
