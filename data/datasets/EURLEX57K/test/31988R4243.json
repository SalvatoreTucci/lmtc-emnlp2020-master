unroasted and not freed of caffeine, falling within subheading 09.01 A I a) of the Common Customs Tariff and of 10 000 tonnes for cocoa beans, whole or broken, falling within heading No 18.01 of the  Common Customs Tariff; whereas these quotas should be opened for their third year of application, namely for the period 1 January to 31 December 1989;\nWhereas the Community has adopted, with effect from 1 January 1988, a combined nomenclature for goods which meets the requirements of the Common Customs Tariff and the Nomenclature of Goods for the External Trade Statistics of the Community and  Statistics of Trade between Member States; whereas in order to accommodate specific Community rules, this nomenclature has been expanded into an integrated tariff of the European Communities (TARIC); whereas, with effect from that date, the combined nomenclature and, where appropriate, the TARIC code numbers, should be used for the  description of the products covered by this Regulation.\nWhereas, in particular, equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all importers, and the rate of duty for the tariff quotas should be applied consistently to all imports until the quotas are used up; whereas, in the light of these  principles, arrangements for the utilization of the tariff quotas based on an allocation among Member States would seem to be consistent with the Community nature of the quotas; whereas, to correspond as closely as possible to the actual trend in the  market in the products in question, allocation of the quotas should be in proportion to the requirements as calculated by reference to statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for  the quota year in question;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports into Member States from third countries which do not benefit from an equivalent tariff preference are as follows:\nMember States Coffee, unroasted and not freed of caffeine Cocoa, beans, whole or broken 1984 1985 1986 1984 1985 1986 Benelux 161 876 148 039 123 203 31 406 50 518 31 511 Denmark  41 793  42 169  37 830     24     27     10 Germany 320 451 587 445 363 398 45 393 63 706 58 885 Greece  22 025  19 765  12 077  2 682  2 708  3 032 Spain (117 191) (121 083)  (86 692) (37 823) (38 923) (15 998) France 103 137 111 283 100 175  2 785  5 355  5 767 Ireland     191     163     162      0      0      0 Italy 129 333 163 912 118 964  2 874  3 851  3 444 Portugal  11 175  12 382  15 831    115    115     23 United Kingdom  46 058  46 098  39 204  6 242  6 782  8 673 Whereas, on the basis of the available data, and taking into account the special nature of the quotas, the initial percentage shares of the quota volumes can be expressed as follows:\nMember States Coffee Cocoa Benelux  0,78  1,69 Denmark  0,22  0,01 Germany  2,29  2,49 Greece  0,10  0,12 Spain 95,00 95,00 France  0,56  0,20 Ireland  0,01  0,01 Italy  0,74  0,14 Portugal  0,07  0,01 United Kingdom  0,23  0,32 Whereas, to take account of the possible import trends for the products concerned, the quota volumes should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent  requirements of Member States which have used up their initial share; whereas, to give importers some degree of certainty, the first part of the Community tariff quotas should be set at a high level, which in this case could be about 99 % of the quota  volumes;\nWhereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas each time its additional share is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until  the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be able to monitor the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member  States accordingly;\nWhereas if, at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused it is essential that the Member State concerned should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve in order to prevent a  part of the Community tariff quotas from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that  economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
