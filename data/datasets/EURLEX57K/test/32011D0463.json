That provision continues to apply to Bulgaria and Romania, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 248/2007.\n(3) The time limits granted to the recipient countries for the submission to the Commission of the requisite documents have expired.\n(4) Due, in the case of Bulgaria, to the late submission of the annual accounts in accordance with Article 5(2) of MAFA, and further to their invalidation by the National Authorising Officer (NAO) due to significant deficiencies identified in the control mechanisms for public measures, and pending additional work still expected from the certifying body, and, in the case of Romania, due to the over-passing of the submission deadline for presenting the annual accounts, and pending the review of supplementary information which had been requested from this country, the Commission decided, by its Decision C(2009) 7496 of 30 September 2009, not to clear the accounts of the Sapard Agencies situated on the territory of Bulgaria and of Romania concerning expenditure effected for the financial year 2008.\n(5) The expected information from Bulgaria and Romania has in the meantime been submitted enabling the Commission to gain additional assurance. Based on the additional checks carried out, the Commission is in the position to take a decision on the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted by the relevant Sapard authorities in Bulgaria and Romania.\n(6) This Decision is adopted on the basis of accounting information.
