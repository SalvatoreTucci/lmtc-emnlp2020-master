However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 of 7 May 2010 fixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2010/2011 marketing year\u00a0(3) fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar at 650\u00a0000 tonnes. This quantity was quickly used. Current high sugar prices provide an incentive for growers to sow additional areas of sugar beet in 2011. Taking into account that the WTO ceiling for exports in the 2010/2011 marketing year has not been fully used, it is appropriate to increase the export quantitative limit by 700\u00a0000 tonnes, to exploit all possible outlet for the product available. This measure will provide additional business opportunities for the Union sugar sector, including prospective opportunities for growers in relation to present sowings, and should further stabilise the market.\n(4) In order to enable economic actors to do the necessary planning of their operations, applications for export licences should be allowed as from the first week of July. It is appropriate to set the period of validity for these licences from 1 September 2011 to 31 December 2011 for this measure to cover only sugar produced under the new, September harvest.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) the following Article 2a is inserted:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 4 July 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 1.7.2006, p. 24.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 8.5.2010, p. 26."}
