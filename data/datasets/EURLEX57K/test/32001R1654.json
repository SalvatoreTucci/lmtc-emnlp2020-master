Under that Article, livestock density is defined taking into account all grazing livestock kept on the farm.\n(2) Because of the difficult situation on the beef and veal market resulting from the sharp drop in demand, due in particular to consumers turning away from beef because of concerns about the increased number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, more cattle are remaining on farms. These animals are taken into account when establishing the holding's stocking density and farmers may accordingly not receive the aid and be penalised for not complying with their undertaking.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 649/2001(6) provides, on the one hand, for the application, until 16 April 2001, of a coefficient to correct the number of livestock units recorded on the holding and, on the other hand, for withdrawal by the farmers concerned from their agri-environmental undertakings without imposition of the penalties that normally apply in such cases. This withdrawal can take place between 1 April and 15 June 2001.\n(4) As the difficult market situation still persists, the period in which farmers can withdraw from their undertakings should be extended by four months.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Regional Development,", "main_body": ["The first paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 649/2001 is replaced by the following: \"In the period between the date of entry into force of this Regulation and 15 October 2001, farmers may withdraw the agri-environment undertaking given under Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 or Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, or the part of that undertaking concerning the extensification of cattle farming, without the penalties provided for in such situations being applied.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 215, 30.7.1992, p. 85.\n(2) OJ L 288, 1.12.1995, p. 35.\n(3) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 80.\n(4) OJ L 214, 13.8.1999, p. 31.\n(5) OJ L 93, 3.4.2001, p. 28.\n(6) OJ L 91, 31.3.2001, p. 49."}
