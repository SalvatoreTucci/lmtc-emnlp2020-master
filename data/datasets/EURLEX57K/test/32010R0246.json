Nevertheless, padded waistcoats, despite the fact that they have no sleeves at all, should be covered by those headings because they are worn over all other clothing for protection against the weather, and because of their padding (See also Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to headings 6101, 6102, 6201 and 6202, second paragraph).\n(3) In order to ensure uniform interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, with regard to the tariff classification of padded waistcoats, it is therefore necessary to specify that padded waistcoats are to be classified in headings 6101, 6102, 6201 or 6202 although they have no sleeves.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 989/89 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 989/89 the following paragraph is added:\n\u2018By derogation from the first paragraph those headings shall include padded waistcoats, despite the fact that they have no sleeves.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 March 2010.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 106, 18.4.1989, p. 25."}
