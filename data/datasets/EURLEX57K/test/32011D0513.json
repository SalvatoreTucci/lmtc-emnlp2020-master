It is also available in liquid form with a clear brown to orange colour. The liquid form contains medium chain triacylglycerides (MCT) as a carrier. It contains lower levels of Phosphatidylserine due to the fact that it includes significant amounts of oil (MCT).\nPhosphatidylserine from soya phospholipids is obtained through enzymatic transphosphatidylation of high-phosphatidylcholine soybean lecithin with the amino acid L-serine. Phosphatidylserine consists of a glycerophosphate skeleton conjugated with two fatty acids and L-serine via a phosphodiester linkage.\nStructural Formula:\nCharacteristics of Phosphatidylserine from soya phospholipids\nParameter Powder Form Liquid Form\nMoisture less than 2\u00a0% less than 2\u00a0%\nPhospholipids not less than 85\u00a0% not less than 25\u00a0%\nPhosphatidylserine not less than 61\u00a0% not less than 20\u00a0%\nGlycerides less than 2\u00a0% not applicable\nfree L-serine less than 1\u00a0% less than 1\u00a0%\nTocopherols less than 0,3\u00a0% less than 0,3\u00a0%\nPhytosterols less than 0,2\u00a0% less than 0,2\u00a0%\nANNEX II\nUse-Level (mg) of Phosphatidylserine from soya phospholipids\nBeverages based on yoghurt 50\u00a0mg/100\u00a0ml\nPowders based on milk powder 3,5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nFoods based on yoghurt 80\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nCereal bars 350\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nChocolate based confectionary 200\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nPhosphatidylserine from soya phospholipids may be used in food for special medical purposes only in compliance with Commission Directive 1999/21/EC\u00a0(1).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 29."}
