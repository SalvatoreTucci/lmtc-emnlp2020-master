Not later than 31 December 1997, each Member State shall establish a list of the fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community to which VMS applies pursuant to Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, as well as a list of the fishing vessels belonging to the categories referred to in Article 3 (1) of that Regulation which are exempted from the VMS pursuant to Article 3 (3) of that Regulation, and shall communicate them to the Commission and, on request, to the other Member States.\n2. Not later than 30 June 1999, each Member State shall establish a list of the fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community to which VMS applies pursuant to Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, as well as a list of the fishing vessels belonging to the categories referred to in Article 3 (2) of that Regulation which are exempted from the VMS pursuant to Article 3 (3) of that Regulation, and shall communicate them to the Commission and, on request, to the other Member States.\n3. When a Member State imposes VMS on vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community which do not fall within the scope of Article 3 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, that Member State shall establish a list of those vessels, and shall communicate it to the Commission and, on request, to the other Member States.\n4. The lists shall contain for each vessel the following information:\n- the flag State,\n- the internal fleet register number,\n- the external identification,\n- the name, and\n- the international radio call sign.\n5. Each Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States which had requested the lists of any changes thereto.", "1. The satellite-tracking devices installed on board the fishing vessels shall ensure the automatic transmission to the fisheries monitoring centre, hereinafter referred to as 'the FMC`, of the flag Member State, at all times, of data relating to:\n- the vessel identification,\n- the most recent geographical position of the vessel, with a position error which shall be less than 500 metres, with a confidence interval of 99 %, and\n- the date and time of the fixing of the said position of the vessel.\n2. Each flag Member State shall take the necessary measures to check the accuracy of the data referred to in paragraph 1.\n3. Without prejudice to the special provisions contained in fisheries agreements concluded between the Community and third countries or in international conventions to which the Community or some of its Member States are a party, each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that its FMC receives through the VMS the information requested in paragraph 1 concerning the fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community, at least every two hours unless otherwise specified in Annex I. The FMC may decide to require the position at shorter time intervals. If a VMS does not offer the possibility of polling the actual position of the fishing vessels, the Member State concerned shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the FMC receives the position of the vessels every hour.\n4. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that its FMC monitors, through the VMS, the date and time of the entry into and the exit from the fishing areas referred to in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 685/95 (3) and the waters of a third country of vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community.", "1. The VMS established by each Member State shall ensure the automatic transmission to the FMC of a coastal Member State of the data relating to the identification and the geographical position of the fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community to which VMS applies and which operate in the waters of the coastal Member State, expressed in degrees and minutes of latitude and longitude, and relating to the date and time of fixing of the said position. Those data shall simultaneously be transmitted to the FMC of the flag Member State in conformity with the format defined in Annex II.\n2. Each Member State shall transmit to the other Member States, before 31 December 1997, a comprehensive list of latitude and longitude coordinates which delimit its exclusive economic zone or exclusive fishery zone.\n3. Coastal Member States monitoring jointly an area may specify a common destination for the transmissions referred to in paragraph 1. They shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.\n4. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure coordination between their competent authorities regarding the establishment and operation of the procedures for transmission to the FMC of a coastal Member State.", "The transmission of data through VMS by a Community fishing vessel, which operates in the fishing areas referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 685/95, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this Regulation, is considered to be the transmission of the effort reports referred to in Articles 19 (b) and 19 (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93.", "1. In the event of technical failure or non-function of the satellite tracking device fitted on board a fishing vessel, the master or the owner of the vessel or their representative shall communicate at least every 24 hours, starting from the time that this event was detected, the data referred to in Article 3 (1) and Article 4 (1) by telex, by fax, by telephone message or by radio, via a radio station approved under the Community legislation for the reception of such reports, to the FMC of the flag Member State and the FMC of the coastal Member State respectively. The same provision applies in the event of technical failure or non-functioning of the VMS of the flag Member State. Such communication is not considered to be the transmission of the effort reports referred to in Articles 19 (b) and 19 (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93.\n2. In the event of technical failure or non-function of the satellite tracking device fitted on board a fishing vessel, the owner of the fishing vessel or the representative of the owner is obliged to have the device repaired or replaced within one month. After that period, the master of a fishing vessel is not authorized to commence a fishing trip with a defective satellite tracking device. However, where a device stops functioning or becomes defective during a fishing trip that lasts more than one month, the repair or the replacement has to take place as soon as the vessel enters a port, and the master of the vessel is not authorized to commence a new fishing trip without the satellite tracking device having been repaired or replaced.\n3. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the master or the owner of the vessel or their representative is informed when the satellite tracking device fitted on board a fishing vessel appears to be defective or non-functioning or, as far as possible, when their VMS is non-functioning.", "Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission shall have, from 1 October 1998 onwards, on specific request, at any time remote access by online sessions to the computer files containing the data recorded by the FMC.", "The name, address, telephone number, telex number and fax number, as well as the X.25 and any other addresses used for electronic data transmission, of the competent authority responsible for a FMC, are listed in Annex III.
