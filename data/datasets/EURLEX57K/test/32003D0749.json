Accordingly, in order to prevent the spread of that disease and contribute to its eradication, the Community should contribute to eligible expenditures incurred by Belgium. It is therefore appropriate that a financial contribution from the Community should be granted to Belgium under the provisions of Decision 90/424/EEC in order to cover the costs related to the outbreak of avian influenza in 2003.\n(3) It is necessary to clarify the concepts of \"swift and adequate compensation of the livestock farmers\" and \"destruction, cleaning, disinfection and disinsectisation costs\" used in Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and the concepts of \"reasonable payments\" and \"justified payments\" mentioned in the present Decision.\n(4) On 13 June 2003, Belgium presented tables with the value of different types of poultry and eggs. These values are the basis for the eligible compensations granted to the owners. They may be adapted on a regular basis in function of the price evolution in Belgium and surrounding Member States.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules are to be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(6) Having regard to the budgetary situation for the emergency fund at this stage of the 2003 exercise, and to the uncertainty on the final eligible amount needed to compensate the outbreak of the disease, the financial contribution at this stage should be limited to an advance covering 50 % of the eligible costs incurred for the obligatory killing of the animals and the obligatory destruction of the eggs.\n(7) The financial contribution from the Community should be granted provided that the actions planned are carried out efficiently and that the competent authorities supply all the necessary information within the time limits laid down in this Decision.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Payment of a financial contribution from the Community to Belgium\nBelgium may obtain a financial contribution from the Community of 50 % of the eligible expenditure for:\n(a) the swift and adequate compensation of the owners for their animals killed and their eggs destroyed pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 92/40/EEC and Article 10 of Council Directive 90/425/EEC(5) under compulsory eradication measures related to outbreaks of avian influenza which occurred in 2003, pursuant to the provisions of the first and seventh indent of Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and in accordance with the present Decision;\n(b) the costs of the destruction of carcases, eggs, contaminated feedingstuffs and equipment, the cleaning, disinsectisation and disinfection of holdings and equipment, pursuant to the provisions of the first, second and third indent of Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and in accordance with the present Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \"swift and adequate compensation\" means payment within 90 days:\n- of the killing of the animals, for compensation corresponding to the market value as defined in Article 3(1),\n- of the destruction of the eggs, for compensation corresponding to the market value as defined in Article 3(1);\n(b) \"reasonable payments\" means payments for the purchase of materials or services at proportionate prices compared to the market prices before the outbreak of the avian influenza;\n(c) \"justified payments\" means payments for the purchase of materials or services of which the nature and the direct link with the compulsory killing of animals or the destruction of the eggs, as referred to in Article 1(a), is demonstrated.", "The eligible expenditure covered by the financial contribution from the Community\n1. The maximum eligible expenditure for the compensation of the owners of the animals and the eggs shall be based on the market value figures for the different types of poultry and eggs at different stages of their lifecycle fixed in the tables presented by Belgium on 13 June 2003. However, if the compensations effectively paid by Belgium are limited to a certain part of those market value figures, the eligible compensation expenditure shall be calculated on the basis of this part.\n2. At the request of the Belgian authorities, based on appropriate justification, it may be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Decision 90/424/EEC to adjust the calculation of the eligible expenditure in order to take account of the evolution of relevant price indexes for poultry and eggs in Belgium and surrounding Member States.\n3. When the compensation payments made by Belgium pursuant to Article 1(a) are effected after the 90-days deadline laid down in Article 2(a), the eligible amounts shall be reduced for expenditure effected after the deadline as follows:\n- 25 % for payments made between 91 and 105 days after the killing of the animals or the destruction of the eggs,\n- 50 % for payments made between 106 and 120 days after the killing of the animals or the destruction of the eggs,\n- 75 % for payments made between 121 and 135 days after the killing of the animals or the destruction of the eggs,\n- 100 % for payments beyond 136 days after the killing of the animals or the destruction of the eggs.\nHowever, the Commission will apply a different time scale and/or lower reductions or none at all, if exceptional management conditions are encountered for certain measures, or if other well-founded justifications are introduced by Belgium.\n4. The costs referred to in Article 1(b) eligible for a financial contribution shall only be those set out in Annex III.\n5. The calculation of the financial contribution from the Community shall exclude:\n(a) value added tax;\n(b) salaries of civil servants;\n(c) use of public material other than consumables.", "Conditions for payment and supporting documentation\n1. Subject to the results of the eventual checks referred to in Article 5, an advance of EUR 1250000 shall be paid on the basis of supporting documents submitted by Belgium concerning the swift and adequate compensation of owners for the compulsory killing of the animals and compulsory destruction of the eggs in 2003 pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 92/40/EEC and Article 10 of Directive 90/425/EEC.\n2. The balance of the financial contribution from the Community shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Decision 90/424/EEC on the basis of:\n(a) a claim submitted in accordance with Annexes I A, I B and II within the time limits provided for in paragraph 3;\n(b) detailed documents confirming the figures in the claim referred to in point (a);\n(c) the results of the eventual on-the-spot checks by the Commission as referred in Article 5.\nThe documents referred to in point (b) as well as relevant commercial information shall be made available for on-the-spot checks by the Commission.\n3.
