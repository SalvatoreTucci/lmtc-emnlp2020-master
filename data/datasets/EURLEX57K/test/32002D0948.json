It is to be deducted from the total amount of the Community contribution.\n(3) Under Article 9(4) of that Regulation, Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(3) apply to the Community contribution to establishing the vineyard register.\n(4) Portugal has sent the Commission the documents needed to decide on the amount to be defrayed as expenditure incurred in establishing the register.\n(5) The Commission has carried out the checks provided for in Article 9(2) of Council Regulations (EEC) No 729/70(4) and (EC) No 1258/1999.\n(6) In the light of the checks carried out, some of the expenditure declared by Portugal does not meet the statutory requirements provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86 and therefore may not be funded by the Community.\n(7) Under Article 4(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86, the final date for establishing the register in Portugal was 31 December 2000. A Community contribution should therefore be refused for expenditure on work completed after that date.\n(8) A breakdown of the amounts to be defrayed and the amounts to be excluded for failure to comply with Community rules was sent to Portugal on 23 October 2002,", "main_body": ["The Community contribution to the expenditure incurred by Portugal in establishing the Community vineyard register shall be as set out in the table annexed to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 208, 31.7.1986, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 210, 28.7.1998, p. 14.\n(3) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 103.\n(4) OJ L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.\nANNEX\n>TABLE>"}
