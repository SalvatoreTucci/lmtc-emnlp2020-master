It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, on 5 September 2011.\n(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of ethoprophos on 30 January 2013\u00a0(5). The draft assessment report, the addendum and the opinion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 3 October 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for ethoprophos.\n(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for ethoprophos.\n(7) The Commission has come to the conclusion that the further confirmatory information showed that a high risk for birds and earthworm eating mammals cannot be excluded except by imposing further restrictions.\n(8) It is confirmed that the active substance ethoprophos is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. In order to minimise the exposure of birds and earthworm eating mammals, it is, however, appropriate to further restrict the uses of this active substance and to provide for specific risk mitigation measures for the protection of those species.\n(9) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing ethoprophos.\n(11) For plant protection products containing ethoprophos, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 18 months after the entry into force of the Regulation.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing ethoprophos as active substance by 11 June 2014.", "Grace period\nAny grace period granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire by 11 June 2015 at the latest.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2007/52/EC of 16 August 2007 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil as active substances (OJ L 214, 17.8.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of confirmatory data submitted for the active substance ethoprophos.

Only one application per season may be authorised, at a rate not exceeding 6\u00a0kg active substance/ha.\nAuthorisations shall be limited to professional users.\nPART B\nIn assessing applications to authorise plant protection products containing ethoprophos for uses other than potatoes not cultivated for human or animal consumption, Member States shall pay particular attention to the criteria in Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and shall ensure that any necessary data and information is provided before such an authorisation is granted.\nFor the implementation of the uniform principles as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the conclusions of the review report on ethoprophos, and in particular Appendices I and II thereof, as finalised in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 16 March 2007, shall be taken into account.\nIn this overall assessment Member States shall pay particular attention to:\n(a) the dietary exposure of consumers;\n(b) the operator safety, ensuring that the conditions of use prescribe the application of adequate personal and respiratory protective equipment and other risk mitigation measures such as the use of a closed transfer system for the distribution of the product;\n(c) the protection of birds, mammals, aquatic organisms, surface and groundwater under vulnerable conditions.\nConditions of authorisation shall include risk mitigation measures, such as buffer zones and the achievement of complete incorporation of granules in the soil.\u2019"}
