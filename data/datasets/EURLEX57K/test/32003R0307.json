The refunds must be fixed taking account of restrictions under agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.\n(3) Refunds must be fixed taking account, in particular, of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand.\n(4) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.\n(5) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons and apples and of classes Extra, I and II of the common trading standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.\n(6) In order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and without discriminating between exporters, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements.
