Under Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 areas set aside must remain so for a period commencing on 15 January at the latest and ending on 31 August at the earliest and, except as otherwise provided for, may not be used for agricultural production or a lucrative purpose.\n(2) In recent months certain regions of the Community have experienced extreme drought that has seriously affected fodder supplies and occasioned livestock farmers severe income loss because obliged to sell their stock when its normal feed has been unavailable.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1360/2003 derogating, for the marketing year 2003/2004, from Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 as regards the use of land set aside in certain regions of the Community(5) authorises use for animal feed purposes of the land declared as set aside in these regions. But since drought conditions have spread to other Community regions it is desirable to find additional feed resources prior to the autumn.\n(4) Since under the present exceptional weather conditions feed supply availability remains highly unpredictable a new derogation from Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 should be urgently introduced whereby the Member States affected may allow arable crop set-aside land to be used for animal feed purposes before expiry of the set-aside period in line with terms and criteria set by them. These rules must however effectively disallow any lucrative utilisation of such land.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1. By way of derogation from Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999, Member States may, in regions of the Community not listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1360/2003, allow land declared as set-aside for the 2003/2004 marketing year to be used for animal feed purposes in line with terms and criteria set by them.\n2.
