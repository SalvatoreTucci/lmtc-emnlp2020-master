For that purpose, where the person enjoys international protection in a Member State other than the one in which that person is currently residing as a long-term resident, it is necessary to provide, unless refoulement is permitted under Directive 2004/83/EC, that that person may be expelled only to the Member State which granted international protection and that that Member State is obliged to readmit that person. The same safeguards should apply to a beneficiary of international protection who has taken up residence but has not yet obtained long-term resident status in a second Member State.\n(11) Where the expulsion of a beneficiary of international protection outside the territory of the Union is permitted under Directive 2004/83/EC, Member States should be obliged to ensure that all information is obtained from relevant sources, including, where appropriate, from the Member State that granted international protection, and that it is thoroughly assessed with a view to guaranteeing that the decision to expel that beneficiary is in accordance with Article 4 and Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(12) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and in particular in Article 7 thereof.\n(13) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Union, their own tables, illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 21) on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(15) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the Position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application,", "main_body": ["Directive 2003/109/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, point (f) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(f) \u201cinternational protection\u201d means international protection as defined in Article 2(a) of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted\u00a0(5);\n(2) Article 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 2, points (c) and (d) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) are authorised to reside in a Member State on the basis of a form of protection other than international protection or have applied for authorisation to reside on that basis and are awaiting a decision on their status;\n(d) have applied for international protection and whose application has not yet given rise to a final decision;\u2019;\n(b) in paragraph 3, point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) the European Convention on Establishment of 13 December 1955, the European Social Charter of 18 October 1961, the amended European Social Charter of 3 May 1987, the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers of 24 November 1977, paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the Protocol signed in New York on 31 January 1967, and the European Agreement on Transfer of Responsibility for Refugees of 16 October 1980.\u2019;\n(3) Article 4 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following paragraph is inserted:\n(b) in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added:\n(4) in Article 8, the following paragraphs are added:\n(5) in Article 9, the following paragraph is inserted:\n(6) in Article 11, the following paragraph is inserted:\n(7) Article 12 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following paragraphs are inserted:\n(b) the following paragraph is added:\n(8) the following Article is inserted:\n(9) in Article 22, the following paragraph is inserted:\n(10) in Article 25, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 May 2013.
