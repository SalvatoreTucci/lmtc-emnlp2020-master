Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provide that the production refund applying to raw sugar, sucrose syrups and unprocessed isoglucose is to be derived from the refund fixed for white sugar in accordance with a method of calculation specific to each basic product.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 also lays down provisions for establishing the production refund. Article 9 of that Regulation provides that the production refund on white sugar is to be fixed at monthly intervals commencing on the first day of each month. It may be adjusted in the intervening period where there is a significant change in the prices for sugar on the Community and/or world markets. The application of those provisions results in the production refund fixed in Article 1 of this Regulation for the period shown.\n(4) As a result of the amendment to the definition of white sugar and raw sugar in Article 1(2)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, flavoured or coloured sugars or sugars containing any other added substances are no longer deemed to meet those definitions and should thus be regarded as \"other sugar\". However, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001, they attract the production refund as basic products. A method should accordingly be laid down for calculating the production refund on these products by reference to their sucrose content.\n(5) The period of validity of refund certificates applied for in July 2001 should be limited so that there is no difference in treatment between operators using the refund certificates by 30 September 2001 and those using them after that date.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The production refund on white sugar referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 shall be equal to EUR 33,936/100 kg net.", "Notwithstanding Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001, refund certificates applied for in July 2001 shall expire on 30 September 2001.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 June 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 72."}
