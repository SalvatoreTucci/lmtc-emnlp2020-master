Community demand for the products to which that Regulation applies should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose with effect from 1 January 2009, one new Community tariff quota should be opened at zero rate of duty for the appropriate amount while avoiding any disturbance to the market regarding this product.\n(2) The quota amounts for two autonomous Community tariff quotas are insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period ending on 31 December 2008. Consequently, those quota amounts should be increased with effect from 1 January 2008.\n(3) The quota amount for one autonomous Community tariff quota disturbs the internal market of the Community. Consequently, this quota amount should be reduced.\n(4) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2009 for certain products for which such quotas were established for 2008. Those quotas should therefore be closed with effect from 1 January 2009 and the corresponding products should be removed from the list in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.\n(5) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 to be replaced in its entirety.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community.\n(8) Since the tariff quotas have to take effect from 1 January 2009, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 shall be replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "With effect from 1 January 2008, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96:\n(a) the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number 09.2812 shall be fixed at 4\u00a0000 tonnes;\n(b) the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number 09.2950 shall be fixed at 15\u00a0000 tonnes.", "With effect from 1 January 2009, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96:\n\u2014 the quota volume for the tariff quota for order number 09.2908 shall be fixed at 40\u00a0000 tonnes.", "With effect from 1 January 2009, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, a row for order number 09.2631 shall be inserted.", "With effect from 1 January 2009, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, the rows for the order numbers 09.2618, 09.2713, 09.2719, 09.2771 and 09.2775 shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2009.\nHowever, Article 2 shall apply from 1 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
