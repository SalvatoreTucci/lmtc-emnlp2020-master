Those rules need to be supplemented as regards the conditions for recognising transnational producer organisations and transnational associations of recognised producer organisations, clarifying the responsibility of the Member States involved and, while respecting the freedom of establishment, ensuring that the applicable rules are those of the Member State where a significant share of the activities of such organisations or associations takes place.\n(2) In addition, rules should be laid down relating to the establishment and the conditions of administrative assistance to be given in the case of transnational cooperation. Such assistance should in particular include the transfer of information that would allow the competent Member State to assess whether a producer organisation or association of recognised producer organisations complies with the terms of recognition. Such information is necessary to allow the competent Member State to take action in case of non-compliance.\n(3) Additional rules should be laid down regarding the calculation of the volume of raw milk covered by the negotiations between recognised producer organisations and processors or collectors of raw milk. To take into account the seasonal variability of milk production, the calculation should compare the milk volume covered by the negotiation for the time period of delivery with the estimated volume of milk production representative for that period, to assess compliance with the maximum ceilings laid down in Article 126c of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007,", "main_body": ["Headquarters\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A transnational producer organisation shall establish its headquarters in the Member State in which it has a significant number of members or a significant volume of marketable production.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A transnational association of recognised producer organisations, hereinafter referred to as \u2018transnational association\u2019, shall establish its headquarters in the Member State where it has a significant number of member organisations or a significant volume of marketable production.", "Responsibilities of the Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member State in which the headquarters of the transnational producer organisation or transnational association are established shall be responsible for the following:\n(a) recognising the transnational producer organisation or the transnational association in accordance with Article 126a of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and carrying out the tasks referred to in Article 126a(4) of that Regulation;\n(b) establishing the necessary administrative collaboration with the other Member States in which the members or member organisations are located with respect to verifying compliance with the terms of recognition referred to in Article 126a of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007;\n(c) providing, on request of the other Member States, all relevant information and documentation to the other Member States in which the members or member organisations are located.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, the other Member States shall give all necessary administrative assistance to the Member State in which the headquarters of the transnational producer organisation or transnational association are established, including the transfer of all relevant information.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a producer organisation or an association of recognised producer organisations conducts negotiations as referred to in Article 126c of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in a Member State other than that in which its headquarters are established, the Member States involved shall ensure that all necessary mutual administrative assistance is given.", "Calculation of amounts of raw milk for negotiation\nFor the purposes of Article 126c(2)(c) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the negotiation ceilings shall be calculated taking into account the delivery period of the raw milk covered by contractual negotiations and the seasonal variability in milk production, where that variability is significant.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 94, 30.3.2012, p. 38."}
