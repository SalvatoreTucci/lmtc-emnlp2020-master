As a consequence, Bulgaria has taken measures in the framework of the Directive.\n(3) In accordance with Article 85(4) of the Directive, as soon as the competent authority of Bulgaria had confirmation of the primary case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals, it applied the measures provided for in Part A of Annex XVIII to the Directive in order to reduce the spread of disease.\n(4) In addition, Bulgaria drew up a plan for the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals in the area defined as infected and specified the measures applied on the holdings in that area in accordance with Part B of Annex XVIII to the Directive.\n(5) On 4 April 2011, within 90 days following the confirmation of foot-and-mouth disease in wildlife, Bulgaria submitted a plan for the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in wildlife in parts of the regions of Burgas, Yambol and Haskovo.\n(6) Following evaluation by the Commission, the plan submitted by Bulgaria complies with the requirements laid down in Part B of Annex XVIII to the Directive and appears to permit the desired objectives to be attained.
