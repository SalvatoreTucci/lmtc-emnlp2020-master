SAMPLING METHOD\nThe following procedure shall be used to take samples of hop cones for determining the moisture content and, where applicable, the extraneous matter content:    1. Sampling      (a) Packed hops\nA weight of hops proportional to the weight of the package shall be taken from the number of packages specified in Article 4. Enough samples should be taken to ensure that there are enough cones to be representative of the package.\n(b) Hops in a loose pile\nTake equal portions from 5 to 10 different places in the pile both at the surface and at various depths. Place sample in the container as soon as possible. To avoid rapid deterioration, the quantity of hops must be sufficiently large to be highly compressed when the container is closed.\nThe sample must weigh at least 100 g.\n2. Mixture\nThe samples must be carefully mixed to be representative of the consignment.\n3. Sub-sampling\nAfter mixing take one or more representative samples and place them in a waterproof, airtight container such as a metal box or glass jar, except where only the extraneous matter content is to be checked.\n4. Except during transport, samples must be stored in a cold place. Care should be taken to allow the samples to return to room temperature inside the container before opening for examination or analysis.\nB. METHOD FOR CHECKING THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF HOPS      1. Method (i)\nSamples for moisture content should not be ground. It is important that they should be exposed to the air only for the minimum time necessary for their transfer from the container to the weighing vessel (which must have a lid).\nApparatus\nBalance sensitive to 0 7005 g.\nDrying oven electrically heated and thermostated to 105 to 107 \u0e22\u0e1aC (the efficacy of the oven should be checked by the copper sulphate test).\nMetal dishes 70 to 100 mm in diameter, 20 to 30 mm deep and provided with well-fitting lids.\nOrdinary desiccator, suitable for accommodating the dishes and containing a desiccant such as indicator silica gel.\nMethod\nTransfer 3 to 5 g of hops to a dish and close the lid before weighing. Weigh as quickly as possible. Remove the lid and place the dish in the oven for one hour exactly. Replace the lid, place the dish in a desiccator to cool for at least 20 minutes and then weigh the dish.\nCalculation\nCalculate the loss of weight as a percentage of the original weight of hops. The maximum deviation for individual estimation is 1 %.\n2. Method (ii)\nMethod using either an electronic weighing machine which dries the hops with infra-red rays or hot air, or an electric measuring apparatus, which registers on a scale the degree of humidity of the sample taken.\nC. METHOD FOR CHECKING THE EXTRANEOUS MATTER CONTENT        1. Determination of the leaf and stalk, bract and waste content\nSieve five 100 g samples using a 2 mm sieve. Collect the lupulin, waste and seeds and separate the seeds by hand. Place the samples on one side. Transfer the contents of the 2 mm sieve to a 10 mm sieve and sieve again.\nThe hop cones, leaves, stalks and extraneous matter are collected by hand from the sieve while cone leaves, seeds, lupulin waste and some leaves and stalks pass through. All this is sorted by hand and divided into the following groups:  1. Leaves and stalks,\n2. Hops (cone leaves, hop cones and lupulin),\n3. Waste,\n4. Seeds,\n5. Bracts, in the case of unprepared hops.\nThe waste and the lupulin cannot be separated. The relative percentage of each must therefore be estimated by an objective assessment of the colour and the weight is calculated on the assumption that their density is identical.\nThe various groups are weighed and the percentage which each group represents in the weight of the original sample is determined.\n2. Determination of the seed content\nPlace the 25 g sample in a metal container with a lid and heat in a drying oven for two hours at 115 \u0e22\u0e1aC in order to neutralize the sticky resin.\nWrap the dried sample in coarse cotton cloth and rub vigorously or beat mechanically in order to detach the seeds from the hops. Separate the dried and finely fragmented hops from the seeds with a grinder or a 1 mm metal sieve.\nSeparate any items remaining with the seeds using either a sloping surface covered with emery paper or any other method which gives the same result, i.e. retains the stems and other matter and permits the seeds to roll off.\nWeigh the seeds and determine the percentage of seeds relative to the weight of the original sample.\nANNEX III CODING AND COMPOSITION SEQUENCE OF CERTIFICATE REFERENCE NUMBERS\n1. Certification centre\nA number between 0 and 100 communicated by the Member States.\n2. Member States carrying out certification >PIC FILE= \"T0013676\">\n3. Year of harvesting\nThe last two figures of the year of harvesting.\n4. Identification of the consignment\nThe number given to the consignment by the certifying body (e.g. 12 B 77 170225)\nANNEX IV MARKING OF PACKAGES\nThe marking shall depend on the type of package:    (a) Hop cones put up in bales or ballots:  - printing on the package.\n(b) Hop powder in packets:  - printing on the packet.\n(c) Hop powder or hop extract in metal tins:  - printing on the box or stamping into the metal.\n(d) A sealed package containing a consignment of packets or boxes of powder or extract:  - printing on the sealed package."}
