The competent authority of Thailand has provided the appropriate guarantees. In particular they have guaranteed that all the consignments certified by the competent authority after the date of 21 September 2002 are submitted to a systematic pre-shipment check to control the presence of nitrofurans and their metabolites. Only consignments which are free of such substances are authorised for export to the Community. Therefore, the systematic checks imposed by Decision 2002/251/EC to all the consingments of shrimps should be revoked for consingments certified by the Thai authority after the date of 21 September 2002 as having been submitted to a systematic pre-shipment check.\n(4) Decision 2002/251/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Article 2 paragraph 1 of Decision 2002/251/EC is replaced by the following:\n\"1.
