Greenland and the Faroe Islands therefore comply with the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01781/2006.\n(5) Payment services providers in Greenland and the Faroe Islands participate directly in payment and settlement systems in Denmark, namely either Kronos or Sumclearing. They therefore comply with the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01781/2006.\n(6) Both Greenland and the Faroe Islands have incorporated in their legal orders provisions corresponding to those of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01781/2006, in particular, for Greenland through Act No\u00a0399 of 21 April 2010 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and Act No\u00a06 of 19 May 2010 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, and for the Faroe Islands through Act No\u00a0467 of 17 June 2008 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, with amendments in Act No\u00a0579 of 1 June 2010.\n(7) Greenland and the Faroe Islands have issued legislation which contributes to the building of a sound anti-money laundering regime. In Greenland, this legislation consists particularly of the Royal Decree No\u00a01034 of 30 August 2010 on Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism and the Act No\u00a05 of 19 May 2010 on Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. In the Faroe Islands, the anti-money laundering legislation comprises particularly the Royal Decree No\u00a079 of 29 January 2010 on Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism and the Act on Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, Act No\u00a056 of 9 June 2008 with amendments of 26 May 2010.\n(8) Greenland and the Faroe Islands have in place appropriate legislation to impose financial penalties vis-\u00e0-vis entities or persons listed by the United Nations or the European Union.\n(9) Therefore, both Greenland and the Faroe Islands have adopted the same rules as those established under Regulation (EC) No\u00a01781/2006 and require their respective payment services providers to apply them, thus fulfilling the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(c) of that Regulation.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to grant to Denmark the requested derogation.\n(11) The agreements to be concluded between Denmark and Greenland should make provision to ensure compliance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2) and in particular Articles 25 and 26.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Denmark shall be authorised to conclude agreements with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, to the effect that the transfers of funds between Denmark and Greenland and between Denmark and the Faroe Islands are treated as transfers of funds within Denmark for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01781/2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nMichel BARNIER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 345, 8.12.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31."}
