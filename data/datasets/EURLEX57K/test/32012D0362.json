The main subject issue of the Communication is the increased mortality of bees observed worldwide.\n(2) In 2009 the EFSA project \u2018Bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe\u2019 concluded that the surveillance systems in the EU are, in general, weak and that there is a lack of data at Member States level and a lack of comparable data at EU level.\n(3) In order to improve the availability of data on bee mortality it is appropriate to assist and support certain surveillance studies in Member States on honeybee losses.\n(4) Commission Implementing Decision 2011/881/EU of 21 December 2011 concerning the adoption of a financing decision to support voluntary surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses\u00a0(3) set aside EUR 3\u00a0750\u00a0000 as contribution of the European Union for the implementation of the surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses.\n(5) The EU reference laboratory (EURL) for bee health presented the document \u2018Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses\u2019 (available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/liveanimals/bees/bee_health_en.htm) providing guidance to Member States to elaborate their surveillance studies.\n(6) Member States were invited to send to the Commission their programmes for surveillance studies based on the technical document of the EURL for bee health. Twenty Member States have sent their proposals for the surveillance studies. These proposals have been technically and financially evaluated to assess their conformity with the technical document \u2018Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses\u2019.\n(7) Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have drawn up surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses in line with the technical document \u2018Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses\u2019 and have requested EU financial support.\n(8) A financial contribution should be granted as from 1 April 2012 to the voluntary surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses implemented by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n(9) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4), veterinary measures are to be financed under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation are to apply.\n(10) The payment of the financial contribution should be subject to the condition that the surveillance study programmes planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission and to the EU reference laboratory for bee health.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union shall grant Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom financial assistance for their surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution by the Union:\n(a) shall be at the rate of 70\u00a0% of the eligible costs to be incurred by each Member State referred to in paragraph 1 for the surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses and specified in Annex I for the period from 1\u00a0April 2012 to 30\u00a0June 2013;\n(b) shall not exceed the following:\n1.
