Moreover, experience has been gained from information collected by the Member States in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 2002/887/EC, as well as on the basis of contacts with Japan. Furthermore, appropriate mechanisms are established in this Decision to ensure the monitoring of the conditions of application of the derogations. Therefore it is appropriate to extend the authorisations for derogations granted in this Decision for a longer period than the ones granted by previous Decisions, and namely until 31 December 2020.\n(4) However, and due to phytosanitary reasons, the import of naturally or artificially dwarfed plants of Juniperus L. originating in Japan should take place only during a specific period of each year until 31 December 2020.\n(5) Decision 2002/887/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/887/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
