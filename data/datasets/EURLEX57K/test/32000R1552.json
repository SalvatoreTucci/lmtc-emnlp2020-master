The purpose of this \"note verbale\" was threefold: (i) to inform these countries of the Community's new regulations; (ii) to ask for confirmation of the respective positions as outlined in the annexes of both regulations; and (iii) to have an answer from those countries which did not reply in 1994.\n(2) Among the countries that replied, the following notified the Commission that the import of certain wastes listed in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 is accepted either without any control procedure or is subject to control pursuant to the control procedure which applies to Annexes III or IV to the said Regulation:\n1. Estonia (reply of 10 February 2000),\n2. Hong Kong (reply of 25 February 2000),\n3. Hungary (reply of 9 February 2000),\n4.
