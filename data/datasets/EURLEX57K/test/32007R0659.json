However, it is appropriate to manage these import tariff quotas by attributing import rights as a first step and issuing import licences as a second, as provided for in Article 6(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(2). In this way, operators that have obtained import rights should be able to decide, during the course of the import tariff quota period, the moment when they wish to apply for import licences, taking into account their actual trade flows. In any case, Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period.\n(4) Rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given in the applications and licences, where necessary in addition to or by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed provisions on the applications for import rights, the status of applicants and the issue of import licences. The provisions of that Regulation should apply, from 1 July 2007, to import licences issued pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n(6) In order to prevent speculation, the quantities available within the import tariff quotas should be made accessible to operators which are able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import on a significant scale from third countries. Therefore, in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 25 animals during each of the two reference periods referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, provided that a consignment of 25 animals may be considered to be a commercially viable consignment. Moreover, for administrative reasons, Member States should be allowed to accept certified copies of the documents proving the existence of trade with third countries.\n(7) In addition, a security should be fixed for import rights. Import licences should not be transferable and licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(8) In order to oblige operators to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, submission of the licence application for the quantities allocated should constitute, with regard to the import rights security, a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(9) Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(6) provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their end-use. The animals imported under the import tariff quotas provided for in this Regulation should be monitored for a certain period in order to ensure that they are not slaughtered during that period.\n(10) To this end, a security should be lodged, the amount of which should cover the difference between the Common Customs Tariff duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of animals in question.\n(11) For the sake of clarity, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1081/1999 of 26 May 1999 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for imports of bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 and amending Regulation (EC) No 1143/98\u00a0(7), should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation as of 1 July 2007.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["The import tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds referred to in Annex I are hereby opened every year for the period from 1 July to 30 June of the following year (import tariff quota periods).\nThe tariff quotas shall have order numbers 09.4196 and 09.4197.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, animals as referred to in Article 1 shall be other than for slaughter where they are not slaughtered within four months of the date of acceptance of the declaration of release for free circulation.\nDerogations may be granted in duly proven cases of force majeure.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To qualify under the import tariff quota covered by order number 09.4197, the following documents must be presented:\n(a) for bulls: a pedigree certificate,\n(b) for cows and heifers: a pedigree certificate or a certificate of registration in a herdbook certifying the purity of the breed.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The import tariff quotas referred to in Annex I shall be managed by attributing import rights as a first step and issuing import licences as a second.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) No 1445/95, (EC) No 1291/2000 and (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of application of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, applicants shall demonstrate that they have imported at least 25 animals covered by CN code 0102\u00a090 during each of the two reference periods referred to in that Article.\nMember States may accept as proof of trade with third countries copies of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, duly certified by the issuing authority.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A company formed by the merger of companies each having reference imports complying with the minimum quantity referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may use those reference imports as proof of trade.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for imports rights shall be submitted no later than 13:00, Brussels time, on 20 June preceding yearly import tariff quota period.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A security of EUR 3 per head relating to the import rights shall be lodged with the competent authority together with the application for import rights.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No later than 16:00, Brussels time, on the fifth working day following the end of the period for the submission of applications referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall notify the Commission of the total quantities applied for each order number.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import rights shall be awarded starting from the seventh and no later than the sixteenth working day following the end of the period for the notifications referred to in Article 5(3).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If application of the allocation coefficient referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 results in fewer import rights to be allocated than had been applied for, the security lodged in accordance with Article 5(2) of this Regulation shall be released proportionally without delay.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The release for free circulation of the quantities awarded under the quotas referred to in Annex I is subject to the presentation of an import licence.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications shall cover the total quantity allocated.
