This corresponds to 458202 tonnes for Greece, 972130 tonnes for Spain, 3357 tonnes for France, 686338 tonnes for Italy and 28459 tonnes for Portugal. The amount withheld from production aid for this olive oil marketing year serves as the basis for financing measures to improve the quality of oil during the production cycle commencing on 1 May 2004.\n(3) The financial ceilings for the measures that are eligible for reimbursement from the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund should be fixed.\n(4) As the measures have relatively fixed minimum costs, the ceilings on total financing laid down in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 528/1999 for some Member States may therefore prove to be too low. Appropriate limits should therefore be established in those cases.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["For the production cycle from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the ceilings on financing for the measures laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 528/1999 shall be:\n>TABLE>", "Notwithstanding Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 528/1999, the additional national financial contribution from Member States whose ceiling on financing laid down in Article 1 is EUR 100000 or less shall be no more than EUR 250000.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.
