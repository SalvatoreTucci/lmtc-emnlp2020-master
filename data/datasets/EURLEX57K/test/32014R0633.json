It provides, inter alia, requirements for the production and placing on the market of meat from wild game. Food business operators are to ensure that such meat is placed on the market only if it is produced in compliance with Section IV of Annex\u00a0III to that Regulation.\n(2) Council Directive 89/662/EEC\u00a0(3), provides that Member States are to ensure that veterinary checks at origin and at destination are carried out on products of animal origin subject to intra-Union trade.\n(3) The audits performed at Union level by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission in Member States have shown that trade in unskinned large wild game from a hunting site to an approved game-handling establishment situated in the territory of another Member State is a common practice which accounts for a significant part of the wild game meat produced in the Union.\n(4) This practice has created uncertainties on the practical application of the current provisions of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and the need of compliance with the provisions of Directive 89/662/EEC in particular how to comply with the obligation to ensure the appropriate level of official controls at origin.\n(5) Therefore, in order to ensure that the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, and of Directive 89/662/EEC are complied with, it is necessary to supplement the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 concerning the transport and trade of unskinned large wild game with a certification of compliance with the EU provisions at the place of origin. In order to avoid a disproportionate administrative burden, an alternative approach based on a declaration of a trained person should be allowed if the game handling establishment, close to the hunting area is in another Member State.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Chapter VIII of Section IV of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 sets out the specific requirements for official controls concerning wild game meat. According to the provisions set out in that Chapter, during the post-mortem inspection, the official veterinarian of the game-handling establishment is to take account of the declaration or information that the trained person involved in hunting the animal has provided in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. In cases where unskinned large wild game is transported from a hunting site in another Member State, it is appropriate that the official veterinarians also check that the relevant certificate accompanies the consignment and take into account the information contained in that certificate.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2014 for all consignments arriving at the Member States of destination from that date on.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a055.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a0206.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013).\nANNEX I\nIn Chapter II of Section IV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, point 8 is replaced by the following:\n\u20188. In addition, unskinned large wild game:\n(a) may be skinned and placed on the market only if:\n(i) before skinning, it is stored and handled separately from other food and it is not frozen;\n(ii) after skinning, it undergoes a final inspection in a game-handling establishment in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004;\n(b) may be sent to a game handling establishment in another Member State only if, during transport to that game-handling establishment, it is accompanied by a certificate conforming to the specimen set out in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 636/2014\u00a0(1) issued and signed by an official veterinarian, attesting that the requirements set out in point 4 as regards the availability of a declaration, when relevant, and the accompaniment of relevant parts of the body, have been complied with.\nANNEX II\nIn part A of Chapter VIII to Section IV of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 the following point 2a is added:\n\u20182a. The official veterinarian is to check that a health certificate conforming to the specimen set out in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 636/2014\u00a0(1) or the declaration(s) accompanies the unskinned large wild game transported to the game-handling establishment from the territory of another Member State, in accordance with point 8(b) of Chapter II of Section IV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The official veterinarian is to take into account the content of that certificate or declaration(s)."}
