Such obligatory breaks in the long-distance transport of animals take place at control posts, as defined in Article 1(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 of 25 June 1997 concerning Community criteria for control posts\u00a0(4).\n(3) The increase in the number of animals being transported by road over long journeys has led to the need for improved control posts. It is necessary to determine, by consulting stakeholders and using their technical expertise, quality criteria for control posts and to determine which strategies should be developed within the Union.\n(4) In addition, there is a lack of control posts in certain locations and a number of existing control posts are of poor quality. A preparatory action, including the building or renovating of certain control posts, should therefore be carried out.\n(5) In 2008, a call for proposals was published by the Commission for a similar preparatory action, but none of the proposals received met the minimum criteria of the call, due to the lack of sufficient information regarding the economic viability of the projects as well as the source of co-financing.\n(6) Commission Decision 2009/755/EC of 13 October 2009 concerning the adoption of a financing decision towards a preparatory action on control posts for 2009\u00a0(5) established two phases of the preparatory action for 2009: firstly a preliminary study by a procurement procedure and another one by grants.\n(7) In 2009, the preliminary study provided for in Decision 2009/755/EC was initiated to collect information on the current status of control posts as well as to define quality criteria for high quality control posts. That study will also establish economic criteria for providing subsidies to properly renovate or build high quality control posts. The results of the study are expected by May 2010 and the procedure for grants provided for by Decision 2009/755/EC will be initiated on the basis of the criteria established in the study.\n(8) It is appropriate to maintain financing by the Union for that preparatory action. In the general budget of the European Union for 2010, the budgetary authority allocated EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000 to a preparatory action on control posts.\n(9) This Decision constitutes a financing decision within the meaning of Article 75(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and Article 90 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.\n(10) Pursuant to Article 83 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, the validation, authorisation and payment of expenditure should be completed within the time limits laid down in the Implementing Rules.\n(11) For the application of this Decision, it is appropriate to define the term \u2018substantial change\u2019, within the meaning of Article 90(4) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002,", "main_body": ["The preparatory action, as set out in the Annex, (the preparatory action) is hereby adopted.", "For the purposes of this Decision, the definition of \u2018control post\u2019 in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 shall apply.", "The maximum contribution of the European Union for the implementation of the preparatory action is set at EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000, to be financed from budget line 17\u00a004\u00a003\u00a003 of the general budget of the European Union for 2010.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The authorising officer may adopt any changes to this Decision which are not considered substantial within the meaning of Article 90(4) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002, in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and of proportionality.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cumulated changes of the allocations to the actions covered by the preparatory action not exceeding 10\u00a0% of the maximum contribution provided for in Article 3 of this Decision shall not be considered to be substantial within the meaning of Article 90(4) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002, provided that they do not significantly affect the nature and objective of the preparatory action."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0248, 16.9.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0357, 31.12.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0COM(2006) 13 final.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0174, 2.7.1997, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0269, 14.10.2009, p.\u00a026.\nANNEX\nPREPARATORY ACTION FOR CONTROL POSTS FOR 2010\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\nThis preparatory action contains one implementing measure for 2010.\nOn the basis of the objectives given in the preparatory action, the allocation of the budget is for grants for the building or the renovation of control posts (to be implemented in direct centralised management) and is set at: EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grants for the building or the renovation of control posts\nGrants shall be awarded by means of a written agreement (grant agreement).\nLEGAL BASIS\nPreparatory action within the meaning of Article 49(6)(b) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.\nBUDGETARY LINE\n17 04 03 03\nPRIORITIES OF THE YEAR, OBJECTIVES TO BE FULFILLED AND PLANNED RESULTS\nThe increased number of animals being transported by road over long journeys has increased the need for improved control posts where animals are to rest. In the interest of animal health and welfare, it has been necessary to introduce specific measures to avoid stress to the animals and the spread of infectious diseases. The objective of the preparatory action is to increase the use of control posts and promote high quality control posts. This preparatory action is a follow up of a previous preparatory action provided for in Decision 2009/755/EC.\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE OF THE IMPLEMENTING MEASURE\nThe preparatory action shall consist in building or renovating high quality control posts in order to validate an experimental certification scheme based on the results of the feasibility study launched in 2009 pursuant to Decision 2009/755/EC. The preparatory action is expected to encourage an economically viable certification scheme for high quality control posts in order to improve the welfare of animals transported over long journeys.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe implementation shall be carried out directly by the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers.\nTIMETABLE AND INDICATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS/DIRECT AWARD\nA single call for proposals of EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000 shall be published.\nThe preparatory action shall be performed within 24 months from the date of the signature of the grant agreement.\nThe call for proposals shall be launched after the completion of the study on the evaluation of the feasibility as referred to in Section 1.2 of Decision 2009/755/EC foreseen by the end of May 2010.\nMAXIMUM POSSIBLE RATE OF CO-FINANCING\n70\u00a0%\nESSENTIAL SELECTION AND AWARD CRITERIA\nSelection criteria\n\u2014 Financial capacity of the applicant:\n\u2014 applicants must show that they have the financial capacity to carry out the action to be financed,\n\u2014 applicants must provide evidence that they have available own resources needed for the Union co-financing requested and to manage the necessary cash-flow for the management of the project.
