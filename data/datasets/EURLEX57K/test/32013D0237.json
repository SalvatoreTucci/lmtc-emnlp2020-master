By letter dated 10 December 2012, the Commission notified the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland that it had all the information necessary to consider the requests.\n(3) With respect to the supply of goods or services and intra-Community acquisition of goods intended for the maintenance of border bridges and common road sections listed in Annex I and for the construction and subsequent maintenance of border bridges listed in Annex II, the bridges and common road sections, as well as their construction sites, should be regarded as being entirely within the territory either of the Czech Republic or of the Republic of Poland in accordance with an agreement to be concluded between them on the construction and maintenance of bridges and maintenance of common road sections on the Czech-Polish State border. In the absence of special measures, it would be necessary, for each supply of goods or services and intra-Community acquisition of goods, to determine whether the place of taxation is the Czech Republic or the Republic of Poland. Work at a border bridge and common road section carried out within the territory of the Czech Republic would be subject to value added tax (VAT) in the Czech Republic while that carried out within the Republic of Poland\u2019s territory would be subject to VAT in the Republic of Poland.\n(4) The purpose of the request for the derogation from Article 5 of Directive 2006/112/EC is therefore to simplify the procedure for collecting VAT with respect to the construction and maintenance of the border bridges and of common road sections of the two Member States.\n(5) The derogation could affect the overall amount of the tax revenue of the Member States collected at the stage of final consumption only to a negligible extent and has no negative impact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from valued added tax,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject to the entry into force of an agreement to be concluded between the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland on the maintenance of bridges and common road sections on the Czech-Polish State border, as referred to in Annex I to this Decision, and on the construction and subsequent maintenance of bridges on the Czech-Polish State border, as referred to in Annex II to this Decision, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland are hereby authorised to apply, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3, measures derogating from Article 5 of Directive 2006/112/EC in relation to the construction and maintenance of those border bridges and common road sections, all of which are partly within the territory of the Czech Republic and partly within the territory of the Republic of Poland.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This authorisation shall also apply to any additional bridges and common road sections which are brought within the scope of the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 by an exchange of diplomatic notes.
