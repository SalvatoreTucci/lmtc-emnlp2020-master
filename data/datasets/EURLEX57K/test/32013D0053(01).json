The weighting of Latvijas Banka in the ECB\u2019s capital key is 0,2821\u00a0%, pursuant to Article 2 of Decision ECB/2013/28 of 29 August 2013 on the national central banks\u2019 percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank\u2019s capital\u00a0(3). Latvijas Banka has already paid up part of its share in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital, pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/20 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\u00a0(4). The outstanding amount is therefore EUR 29\u00a0424\u00a0263,59, which results from multiplying the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital (EUR 10\u00a0825\u00a0007\u00a0069,61) by the capital key weighting of Latvijas Banka (0,2821\u00a0%), minus the part of its share in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital that has already been paid up.\n(3) Article 48.1, in conjunction with Article 30.1, of the Statute of the ESCB provides that the NCB of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated must also transfer foreign reserve assets to the ECB. Pursuant to Article 48.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the sum to be transferred is determined by multiplying the euro value at current exchange rates of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the NCB concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the NCBs of the other Member States whose currency is the euro. When determining the \u2018foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB in accordance with Article 30.1\u2019, due account should be taken of previous capital key adjustments\u00a0(5) pursuant to Article 29.3 of the Statute of the ESCB and the ECB capital key expansions pursuant to Article 48.3 of the Statute of the ESCB\u00a0(6). As a result, pursuant to Decision ECB/2013/26 of 29 August 2013 laying down the measures necessary for the contribution to the European Central Bank\u2019s accumulated equity value and for adjusting the national central banks\u2019 claims equivalent to the transferred foreign reserve assets\u00a0(7), the euro equivalent of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the ECB under Article 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB is EUR 50\u00a0715\u00a0061\u00a0570,77.\n(4) The foreign reserve assets to be transferred by Latvijas Banka should be in or be denominated in Japanese Yen and gold.\n(5) Article 30.3 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that the ECB must credit each NCB of a Member State whose currency is the euro with a claim equivalent to the foreign reserve assets that it has transferred to the ECB. The provisions regarding the denomination and remuneration of the claims that have already been credited to the NCBs of the Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(8) should also apply to the denomination and remuneration of the claims of Latvijas Banka.\n(6) Article 48.2 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that the NCB of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated must contribute to the ECB\u2019s reserves, to those provisions equivalent to reserves, and to the amount still to be appropriated to the reserves and provisions corresponding to the balance of the profit and loss account as at 31 December of the year prior to the abrogation of the derogation. The amount of this contribution is determined in accordance with Article 48.2 of the Statute of the ESCB.\n(7) By analogy with Article 3.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank\u00a0(9), the Governor of Latvijas Banka has had the opportunity to make observations on this Decision before its adoption,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n(a) \u2018foreign reserve assets\u2019 means gold or cash;\n(b) \u2018gold\u2019 means fine troy ounces of gold in the form of London Good Delivery bars, as specified by the London Bullion Market Association;\n(c) \u2018cash\u2019 means the lawful currency of Japan (Japanese yen).", "Extent and form of paid-up capital\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 January 2014, Latvijas Banka shall pay up the remaining parts of its share in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital, which correspond to EUR 29\u00a0424\u00a0263,59.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Latvijas Banka shall pay the amount specified in paragraph 1 to the ECB on 2 January 2014 by means of a separate transfer via the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Latvijas Banka shall pay to the ECB on 2 January 2014, by a separate TARGET2 transfer, the interest accrued on 1 January 2014 on the amount due to the ECB under paragraph 2.
