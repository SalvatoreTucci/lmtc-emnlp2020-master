whereas those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat is granted (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86 (6);\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and to enable an advance payment to be made to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers, the foreseeable loss of income should be estimated in the light of the foreseeable trend in market prices;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the amount of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that Article by a coefficient expressing the annual average production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs expressed per 100 kg of carcase weight; whereas the coefficient for 1998 has not yet been fixed in view of the lack of full Community statistics; whereas, pending the fixing of that coefficient, a provisional coefficient should be used; whereas Article 5(3) of that Regulation also fixes the amount per ewe for producers of light lambs and per female of the caprine species and at 80 % of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article; whereas that coefficient is fixed by Article 8(4) at 7 %;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 5(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the half-yearly advance payment is fixed at 30 % of the expected premium;

whereas it lays down that the aid is to be granted under the same conditions as those for the grant of the premium for producers of sheepmeat and goatmeat; whereas, in view of the present uncertainty of the market situation in certain Member States, the Member States should be authorised, for the 1998 marketing year, to pay immediately an amount equal to 90 % of the aid;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application of specific measures relating to agricultural production in the Canary Islands; whereas those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the ewe premium to producers of light lambs and she-goats on the same conditions as those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89; whereas those conditions provide that Spain is authorised to pay an advance on the said supplementary premium;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["A difference is hereby estimated between the basic price, reduced by the impact of the coefficient laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, and the foreseeable market price for 1998 is ECU 146,285 per 100 kg.", "1.
