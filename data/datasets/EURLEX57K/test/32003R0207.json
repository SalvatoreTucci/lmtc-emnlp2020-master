Italy still has intervention stocks of paddy rice from harvests earlier than 1999, the quality of which is in danger of deteriorating if kept in prolonged storage. The quantities initially planned for this invitation to tender should therefore be increased by authorising the sale of this at-risk quantity.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1940/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
