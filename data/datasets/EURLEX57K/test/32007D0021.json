Those measures included in particular Commission Decision 2005/760/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries for the import of captive birds\u00a0(4). Commission Decision 2005/760/EC currently applies until 31 December 2006.\n(2) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on animal health and welfare (AHAW) has adopted on 27 October 2006 a Scientific Opinion on the animal health and welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds other than poultry into the Community (\u2018the Opinion\u2019). The Opinion became officially available on 14 November 2006.\n(3) The Opinion has identified a number of areas whereby improvements would significantly reduce any identified health risk related to the import of birds other than poultry. In particular, the Opinion points to the risks of the spreading of viral diseases such as avian influenza and Newcastle Disease via the import of birds other than poultry and identifies possible tools and options which can reduce any identified animal health risk related to the import of these birds. Because this Scientific Opinion will guide the future policy of the EU on the animal health and welfare aspects of these imports, it is important to properly assess the scientific input received by the Commission by giving careful consideration to the conclusions and recommendations laid down in the Opinion, in order to put in place a coherent system for these imports.\n(4) With regard to the measures laid down in Decision 2005/760/EC, the Commission has started the evaluation of the Opinion immediately after its release and a first analysis of the Opinion and the possible modifications to these measures has taken place during an expert working group meeting in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 14 November 2006 and in the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 27 November 2006. However, in the light of the current world animal health situation regarding avian influenza, in order to allow the Member States as they indicated at the meeting of 27 November 2006 and the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, to finalise this evaluation and to prepare the measures to be laid down, the restrictions provided for in Decision 2005/760/EC should be continued for a short transitional period.\n(5) Decision 2005/760/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Decision 2005/760/EC the date \u201831 December 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 March 2007\u2019.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
