At the request of Spain and France, that date should be fixed for those Member States.\n(3) An error was made when new paragraphs were added to Article 48a of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1701/2005\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2183/2005\u00a0(4) both added a paragraph 10. In the interests of clarity, those paragraphs whose numbering was affected should be replaced by correctly numbered paragraphs, since they could lead to confusion.\n(4) An error was also made in the wording of the paragraph 10 added by Regulation (EC) No 2183/2005, which authorises Malta and Slovenia to grant aid for olive groves in 2006. The maximum amounts provided for in that paragraph are not correct, since these should be the amounts that should have been calculated for the single payment. They should therefore correspond to the olive oil component for those Member States for 2006 given in Annex VIIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. The above provision should therefore be amended.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Paragraph 10 as added by Regulation (EC) No 2183/2005 and paragraph 11 of Article 48a of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 are replaced by the following:\n\u201811.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Malta and Slovenia may grant aid for olive groves per olive GIS-ha in 2006 of a minimum of EUR 47\u00a0000 and a maximum of EUR 120\u00a0000 for a maximum of five categories of olive grove areas as defined in Article 110i(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Slovenia, Articles 12 and 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71\u00a0(5) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/98 shall continue to apply, respectively, in respect of the 2006 harvest and until 31 December 2006\u00a0(6).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "shall apply from 1 January 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
