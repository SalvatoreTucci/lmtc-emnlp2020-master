in the peace process, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2229/97\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 73g and 228a,\nHaving regard to Common Positions 97/759/CFSP (1) and 98/425/CFSP (2) defined by the Council on the basis of Article J.2 of the Treaty on European Union, with regard to Angola and aimed at inducing the 'Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola` (UNITA) to fulfil its obligations in the peace process in view of the relevant decisions of the Security Council of the United Nations, in particular its Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1130 (1997), 1173 (1998) and 1176 (1998),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas the United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, decided in its Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173 (1998) that all States should take certain measures with regard to their economic relations with Angola in order to obtain the implementation by the 'Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola` (UNITA) of its obligations under the 'Acordos de Paz`, the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council Resolutions;\nWhereas certain of these measures fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the territory of the Community is concerned, such territory being deemed to encompass, for the purposes of this Regulation, the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty;\nWhereas the Security Council has also called upon the United Nations Member States to apply these measures notwithstanding the existence of any right or obligations conferred or imposed by any international agreement signed, any contract entered into or any licence or permit granted before the adoption of the aforementioned Resolutions;\nWhereas, therefore, the fourth ACP-EC Convention, signed at Lom\u00e9 on 15 December 1989, to which the Community and Angola are parties, does not pose an obstacle to the application of the said Security Council measures;\nWhereas the data contained in the Annexes to this Regulation concerning areas of Angola to which that State's administration has not been extended, points of entry in Angola for supplies of petroleum, petroleum products, aircraft and aircraft components, aircraft registered in Angola and places in Angola for aircraft to take off or land should be based on the data provided by the Government of Angola to the Committee created pursuant to Resolution 864 (1993) of the Security Council (the 'said Committee`) and notified to the Member States of the United Nations by the said Committee;\nWhereas the aforesaid Resolutions provide for certain exceptions to the restrictions imposed on the condition of prior approval of the said Committee;\nWhereas the approval of the said Committee should be obtained through the competent national authorities of the Member States, whose names and addresses should, therefore, be made available and annexed to this Regulation;\nWhereas, for reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to supplement and/or amend the Annexes to this Regulation on the basis of pertinent notifications from the relevant Security Council Committee or, in the case of Annex VIII, the competent authorities of Member States;\nWhereas the competent authorities of the Member States should be empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation on the freezing of funds and financial resources;\nWhereas there is a need for the Member States and the Commission to inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation;\nWhereas, for reasons of transparency and simplicity, the interruption of certain economic relations with Angola should be governed by only one legal instrument;\nWhereas therefore, the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 2229/97 of 30 October 1997 concerning the interruption of certain economic relations with Angola in order to induce the 'Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola` (UNITA) to fulfil its obligations in the peace process (3), should be incorporated in this Regulation, and that Regulation should be repealed,", "main_body": ["TITLE I\nTrade and provision of services", "The following shall be prohibited:\n1. to import, be it directly or indirectly, diamonds originating in or coming from
