of the Convention establishing a Customs Cooperation Council, in particular the provisions of Article III concerning measures for attaining the highest possible degree of harmony and uniformity in

cooperation between all developed and developing countries and that it should expand its general policy in technical cooperation,\nNoting that a steady growth of world trade implies constant adaptation of customs methods of work,\nNoting that while under its auspices a substantial number of international customs conventions have been concluded, further steps besides promoting accession to

governmental and non-governmental international organizations,\nConvinced that it is also in the interest of international trade to promote technical cooperation,\nConvinced that adequate training of customs officials is one of the prerequisites for the smooth functioning of international trade and tourism,\nDesiring that its secretariat should continue    1. to collaborate with member and non-member States which so wish in organizing, on a bilateral or multilateral basis, seminars, training courses and symposia in customs matters, in particular concerning the conventions and other international instruments administered by the Council,\n2. to cooperate with regional and international organizations in organizing regional and interregional seminars on customs matters,\nRECOMMENDS\nThat States whether or not Members of the Council, and customs or economic unions should:      1. provide for the possibility of receiving trainees, and receiving, supplying, or exchanging customs experts and lecturers, utilizing the channels of the Council for these purposes so far as may be possible,\n2. consider, where appropriate and in so far as may be possible, admitting customs officers of other customs administrations to their national customs training schools,\n3. organize seminars, courses or symposia open to or intended for participants of other

date from which they will apply the recommendation, and of the conditions of its application.
