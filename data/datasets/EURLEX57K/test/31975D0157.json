Consequently, SOLMER is concentrated within the meaning of Article 66 (1) with each of the undertakings SOLLAC, USINOR and ATH.\nOn 13 December 1973, SOLLAC, USINOR and ATH (hereinafter called the \"members\") initialled an agreement concerning the coal-producing undertaking SA Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Marseillaise de Cok\u00e9faction (MARCOKE), Paris, with a capital of FF 263 000 000 as at 31 December 1976.\nATH is to acquire in the first instance a holding of 5 % in the capital of MARCOKE with an option of increasing its holding to a probable 25 %, the holdings of SOLLAC and USINOR being simultaneously reduced.\nThe members are to entrust the management and operation of the MARCOKE coking plant to SOLMER.\nAll matters relating to the application and interpretation of the agreement, including relations between the members themselves and with MARCOKE and relations between MARCOKE and SOLMER are to be examined and settled at the members' meeting of SOLMER. The members meeting must reach its decisions by agreement.\nMARCOKE will thus be jointly controlled by the three members. Following the transaction there will therefore be a concentration between MARCOKE SOLLAC, USINOR, and ATH, though there will be no concentration between the members.\nMARCOKE is to set up a coking plant with related installations in Fos-sur-Mer. MARCOKE is to provide metallurgical coke supplies for SOLMER. MARCOKE's coking potential in 1978 is estimated at 1 200 000 metric tons of coke (about 3 % of Community production), which it will supply entirely to SOLMER at cost.\nMARCOKE, although legally separate, constitutes economically a division of SOLMER and will supply one of the raw materials necessary for SOLMER's pig iron production on terms which can be considered normal for iron and steel companies in the Community.\nMARCOKE will neither sell coke on the market nor supply coke to the other works of its members.\nMARCOKE will be a new buyer on the Community coke and coking coal market, which is characterized by market interpenetration, high imports and effective competition. In 1973, 34 % of the 11 800 000 metric tons of metallurgical coke used in France was supplied by French steel works' own coke ovens, 37 % was purchased from French collieries and 29 % was imported.\nThe members are under no other obligation regarding the purchase, production and sale of coke, other than those incumbent upon them for the purposes of the proper operation of the joint company ; the joint production of coke for SOLMER can in no way affect the actions taken independently by the three members to secure their own coke supplies.  (1)OJ No 9, 11.5.1954, p. 345.\nHaving regard to all these considerations, the proposed transaction will not give the parties the power to determine prices, to control or restrict production or distribution or to hinder effective competition in a substantial part of the market for coal and steel, or to evade the rules of competition instituted under the Treaty, in particular by establishing an artificially privileged position involving a substantial advantage in access to supplies or markets.\nConsequently, the proposed transaction satisfies the conditions for authorization set out in Article 66 (2) and may therefore be authorized,", "main_body": ["The establishment of joint control over SA Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Marseillaise de Cok\u00e9faction (MARCOKE) by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lorraine de Laminage Continu SA (SOLLAC), Union Sid\u00e9rurgique du Nord et de l'Est de la France SA (USINOR) and August Thyssen-H\u00fctte AG is hereby authorized.", "This Decision is addressed to SOLLAC, Paris, to USINOR, Paris, and to August Thyssen-H\u00fctte AG, Duisburg-Hamborn."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 1975.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier ORTOLI"}
