OBJECTIVE\nTo adjust production potential to the likely growth in consumption and thereby prevent the structure of production in Belgium from falling further behind that of its partners.\n2. DURATION OF THE PROGRAMME\nThe programme covers a period of three years from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1985.\n3. AREAS CONCERNED\nThe whole of Belgium.\n4. DEVELOPMENT POLICY\nFuture activity will be concentrated on species with well-established rearing technology. Among these species the most important are:\n(a) trout;\n(b) carp;\n(c) tench and roach;\n(d) pike, perch and pike-perch;\n(e) eel.\n5. PRODUCTION TARGETS\nThe target to be achieved by the end of the programme in 1985 is a stable level of carp production and a significant increase in other products, in particular, trout.\n6. INVESTMENT\nInvestments of about Bfrs 60 million or 1,35 million ECU are envisaged during the period covered by this programme.\nANNEX  II\nFinal conclusions\n1. The Commission notes that the programme submitted by the Belgian Government as a framework for future Community and national financing schemes, constitutes an initial measure to guide investments in aquaculture.\nHowever, taking account of the existing situation at Community level in the market for trout and carp reared in fresh water, and pending results of an in-depth analysis of the feasible development of the market, the Commission cannot approve that part of the programme.\n2. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in the programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n3. The Commission considers that the programme targets and their attainment should form the subject of a more detailed analysis within the framework of the annual review referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2908/83 in the light of developments in the structural and economic situation of fish farms in Belgium."}
