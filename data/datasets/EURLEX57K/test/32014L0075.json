The total negative environmental, health and consumer safety impacts caused by substitution of mercury containing CCFLs in industrial monitoring and control instruments are likely to outweigh the total environmental, health and consumer safety benefits thereof.\n(3) To enable the repair and prolong the service life of products, an exemption from the restriction of mercury in CCFLs for back-lighting liquid crystal displays in IMCIs should be granted. In accordance with the repair-as-produced principle, the exemption should apply to all products placed on the market before 22 July 2017, which is the compliance date for IMCIs, and the validity period of the exemption should be 7 years from that date. It is unlikely that the exemption will have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
