It is likely that this will also be the case in 1999 making it necessary to assign placing on the market quotas for HCFCs for 2000;\n(7) Whereas the Commission is required under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 to allocate quotas for controlled substances to undertakings each year in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16;\n(8) Whereas the Commission has published a notice to importers in the European Community of controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer(2) and has thereby received applications for import quotas';\n(9) Whereas import into the Community of chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons is prohibited except for feedstock, destruction and essential uses; whereas import for feedstock and destruction is not quota limited under Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94; Whereas quotas for essential uses are authorised by a separate Commission Decision;\n(10) Whereas the allocation of individual quotas to producers and importers is based on the principles of continuity, equality and proportionality; whereas, in establishing quotas, the Commission has been guided by the need to reduce further the production, import and use of substances which damage the ozone layer while interfering in the market as little as possible;\n(11) Whereas for methyl bromide the import quotas are allocated to the primary importers, considered by the Commission to be the importers who deal directly by way of invoicing with the producers outside the Community reserve of 100,6 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide is retained for allocation during 2000 in accordance with the Article 16 procedure;\n(12) Whereas it is appropriate to retain part of the total HCFC placing on the market quota for allocation to importers in the Community who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas in 1998 and 1999, the level of imports is 4 % of the total quota available; whereas it is appropriate in 2000 to retain 4 % of the total quota for allocation to importers who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas this corresponds to a quantity of 323 ODP tonnes;\n(13) Whereas the HCFC placing on the market quota for each producer in the Community in 2000 shall reflect the market share which that producer reached in 1996, calculated in ODP tonnes; whereas it is appropriate to retain 1996 as a base-year; whereas it is considered appropriate to allocate the total available HCFC quantity of 7756 ODP tonnes between producers without leaving a reserve;\n(14) Whereas Import licenses shall be issued by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of the aforesaid Regulation, after verification of compliance by the importer with Articles 7, 8 and 12;\n(15) Whereas the release for free circulation in the Community of chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons imported from any State not Party is prohibited in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) 3093/94;\n(16) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established by Article 16 of the same Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
