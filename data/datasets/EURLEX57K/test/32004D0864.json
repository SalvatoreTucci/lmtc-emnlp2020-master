An advisory committee (ACF) was created in the fisheries sector by Commission Decision 71/128/EEC\u00a0(1), replaced by Decision 1999/478/EC of 14 July 1999 renewing the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA)\u00a0(2). The membership of ACFA is defined in Article 3 of Decision 1999/478/EC.\n(2) Decision 1999/478/EC set up four working groups to prepare the opinions of the Committee; working group 2 is in charge of Aquaculture.\n(3) Given the rapid growth of European aquaculture in recent years, it is appropriate that the interests of this sector are better represented within ACFA. The membership of this Committee should therefore be extended in order to include the vice-chairman of working group 2.
