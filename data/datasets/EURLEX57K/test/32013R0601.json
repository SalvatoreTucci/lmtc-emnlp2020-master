Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Cobaltous acetate, basic cobaltous carbonate and cobaltous sulphate were authorised without a time limit by Directive 70/524/EEC. These products were subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as existing products, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of cobaltous acetate, basic cobaltous carbonate and cobaltous sulphate as feed additives for all animal species. Additionally, an application based on Article 10(2) was submitted for the re-evaluation of basic cobaltous carbonate in a film granulated form for all animal species. Thirdly, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the authorisation of cobalt carbonate for ruminants, horses and rabbits. For all five compounds of cobalt it was requested that the additives to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019. The three applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinions of 12 June 2012\u00a0(3)\n\u00a0(4) and 22 May 2012\u00a0(5) that, under the proposed conditions of use, cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, cobalt(II) carbonate, cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate, cobalt(II) sulphate heptahydrate and coated granulated cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate do not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment, and that they are an effective sources of cobalt in the respective target species. The Authority also concluded that no safety concerns would arise for users provided that appropriate protective measures are taken to avoid inhalation. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, cobalt(II) carbonate, cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate, cobalt(II) sulphate heptahydrate and coated granulated cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of these substances should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications for the already authorised cobalt compounds, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe substances specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018compounds of trace elements\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Transitional measures\nThe substances specified in the Annex which were authorised by Directive 70/524/EEC and feed containing them, which are produced and labelled before 15 January 2014 in accordance with the rules applicable before 15 July 2013 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(7):2791.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(7):2782.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2727.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nContent of element (Co) in mg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of nutritional additives.
