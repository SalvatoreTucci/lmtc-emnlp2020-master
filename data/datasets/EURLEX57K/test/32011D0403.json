Following an extensive reassessment of the measures taken by that Member State to control BKD in the territory of Great Britain, it was concluded that it is no longer appropriate to apply restrictions on movements of consignments of certain aquaculture animals into the United Kingdom as provided for by that programme. Consequently, the territory of Great Britain should be removed from the list of areas with approved eradication programmes for BKD as set out in Annex II to Decision 2010/221/EU.\n(4) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU currently lists parts of the territories of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as areas of the United Kingdom with approved surveillance programme as regards ostreid herpesvirus 1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar). The United Kingdom has now submitted a surveillance programme as regards OsHV-1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar for Guernsey. That surveillance programme aims to demonstrate that the areas in Guernsey where OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar has not been detected are free of that virus and to prevent its introduction into those areas. The content of that surveillance programme is equivalent to the surveillance programmes which are already approved and listed in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU.\n(5) There have been no detections of increased mortalities in the farms and relaying areas keeping Pacific oysters in Guernsey during the last 2 years. According to information submitted by the United Kingdom, Pacific oyster business operators have applied a voluntary ban on movements of pacific oysters into Guernsey since April 2010. That information suggests that Guernsey is free of OsHV-1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar. Movement restrictions to protect the health status of Pacific oysters in that territory should be approved.\n(6) The surveillance programme for Guernsey should therefore be approved and Guernsey should be included in the list set out in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU.\n(7) Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Decision 2010/221/EU are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 24.11.2006, p. 14.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 98, 20.4.2010, p. 7.\nANNEX\nANNEX II\nMember States and parts thereof with eradication programmes as regards certain diseases in aquaculture animals, and approved to take national measures to control those diseases in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the area with approved national measures\nBacterial kidney disease (BKD) Finland FI The continental parts of the territory\nSweden SE The continental parts of the territory\nInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPN) Sweden SE The coastal parts of the territory\nANNEX III\nMember States and areas with surveillance programmes regarding ostreid herpesvirus 1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar), and approved to take national measures to control that disease in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the areas with approved national measures (Member States, zones and compartments)\nOstreid herpesvirus 1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1\u00a0\u03bc\u03bdar) Ireland IE Compartment 1: Sheephaven and Gweedore bays.\nUnited Kingdom UK The territory of Great Britain except Whitstable Bay, Kent."}
