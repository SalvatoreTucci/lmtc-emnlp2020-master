It appears that in practice the procedure for the import and the sale of the goods under the system have become far more differentiated. Where previously a single operator was in general dealing with the purchase in the third country, the release into free circulation and the sale in the Community, nowadays several operators are involved in the different operations making often impossible the respect of those time-limits. It is therefore appropriate to extend those time-limits.\n(5) Regulations (EC) No 1484/95 and (EC) No 504/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1484/95, paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case referred to in paragraph 2, the importer must lodge the security referred to in Article 248(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, equal to the difference between the amount of additional import duty calculated on the basis of the representative price applicable to the product in question and the amount of additional import duty calculated on the basis of the cif import price of the consignment in question.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importer shall have two months from the sale of the products in question, subject to a limit of nine months from the date of acceptance of the declaration of release for free circulation, to prove that the consignment was disposed of under conditions confirming the correctness of the prices referred to in paragraph 2.
