Since the provisions relating to an import quota of cheese originating in Jordan are no more compatible with the free and unlimited access into the Community of that product as provided for in Protocol 1 of the Association Agreement as replaced by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters referred above, they should be deleted.\n(3) Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 provides for a yearly tariff quota of butter originating in New Zealand.\n(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2175/2005 of 21 December 2005 concerning the implementation of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and New Zealand pursuant to Article XXIV.6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedules of the Czech republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic in the course of their accession to the European Union, supplementing Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(4), provides for an additional allocation of 735 tonnes of butter originating in New Zealand under the annual import tariff quota.
