This is the case for pesticides or metabolites of pesticides with an acceptable daily intake lower than 0,0005 mg/kg body weight.\n(4) Directive 91/321/EEC establishes the principle of the prohibition of the use of these pesticides in the production of agricultural products intended for infant formulae and follow-on formulae. The pesticides in question should be listed in Annex IX to Directive 91/321/EEC. However, this prohibition does not necessarily guarantee that products are free from such pesticides, since some pesticides contaminate the environment and their residues may be found in the products concerned.\n(5) The health of infants and young children can be better protected by applying additional requirements which can be enforced by analysis regardless of a product's origin.\n(6) Most of the pesticides which have acceptable daily intake values lower than 0,0005 mg/kg body weight are already prohibited in the Community or will be prohibited by July 2003. The prohibited pesticides should not be detectable in infant formulae and follow-on formulae by state of the art analytical methods. However, some pesticides degrade slowly and still contaminate the environment. They might be present in infant formulae and follow-on formulae even if they have not been used. For the purposes of control, a harmonised approach has to be followed.\n(7) Pending Commission decisions on whether they satisfy the safety requirements of Article 5 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/5/EC(6), the continued use of authorised pesticides should be permitted as long as their residues comply with the maximum residue levels established in the present Directive. The latter should be set at levels ensuring that their respective acceptable daily intake values are not exceeded by infants and young children under worst-case intake conditions.\n(8) Directive 91/321/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 91/321/EEC is amended as follows:\n1. Article 6 is amended as follows:\n- Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\"1. Infant formulae and follow-on formulae shall not contain any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants and young children. Necessary maximum levels for substances other than those referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be established without delay.\"\n- Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\"3. (a) Those pesticides listed in Annex IX shall not be used in agricultural products intended for the production of infant formulae and follow-on formulae. However, for the purpose of control:\n(i) pesticides listed in Table 1 of Annex IX are considered not to have been used if their residues do not exceed a level of 0,003 mg/kg. This level which is considered to be the limit of quantification of the analytical methods shall be kept under regular review in the light of technical progress;\n(ii) pesticides listed in Table 2 of Annex IX are considered not to have been used if their residues do not exceed a level of 0,003 mg/kg. This level shall be kept under regular review in the light of data on environmental contamination.\n(b) By derogation of paragraph 2, for the pesticides listed in Annex X, the maximum residue levels specified therein shall apply.\nFor pesticides listed in Annex X, where a decision concerning the non-inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is taken, Annex IX and Annex X to this Directive shall be amended accordingly.\n(c) The levels referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall apply to the products as proposed ready for consumption or as reconstituted according to the instructions of the manufacturers.\"\n2.
