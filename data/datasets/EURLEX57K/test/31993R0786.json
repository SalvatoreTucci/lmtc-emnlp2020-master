whereas such aid is  fixed at an amount equal to the export refund for the product in question plus a fixed component to take account of small deliveries;\nWhereas export refunds for malt, and groats and meal of durum wheat are fixed, during certain periods of each marketing year, by reference to the prices for cereals and cereal products on the Community market and on the world market; whereas, during  other periods, the refunds remain fixed at a non-operational level; whereas, owing to this seasonal aspect, during the latter periods, the amount of supply aid calculated in this way means that Community products are not competitive in relation to  products originating in third countries;

whereas Regulations (EEC) No 2027/92, (EEC) No 1961/92 and (EEC) No 1962/92 fixing the amount of aid for the supply respectively to the FOD,  the Azores and Madeira, and the Canary Islands of certain cereal products of Community origin should therefore be amended;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2027/92 is hereby replaced by the following:\n'Article 2\n1.
