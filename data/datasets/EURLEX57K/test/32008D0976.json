This decentralisation of mutual legal assistance is now widely implemented.\n(3) The principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is being implemented gradually. It not only confirms the principle of direct contacts between competent judicial authorities, it also accelerates the procedures and makes them entirely judicial.\n(4) The impact of these changes on judicial cooperation was further increased by the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007. Because of this evolution, the European Judicial Network is even more necessary than at the time of its creation and should therefore be strengthened.\n(5) By Decision 2002/187/JHA\u00a0(4), the Council set up Eurojust to improve coordination and cooperation between competent authorities of the Member States. Decision 2002/187/JHA provides that Eurojust is to maintain privileged relations with the European Judicial Network based on consultation and complementarity.\n(6) Five years of coexistence of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network have demonstrated both the need to maintain the two structures and the need to clarify their relationship.\n(7) Nothing in this Decision should be construed to affect the independence that contact points may have under national law.\n(8) It is necessary to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States and to allow contact points of the European Judicial Network and Eurojust for this purpose to communicate, whenever needed, directly and more efficiently through a secure telecommunications connection.\n(9) Joint Action 98/428/JHA should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Decision,", "main_body": ["Creation\nThe network of judicial contact points set up between the Member States under Joint Action 98/428/JHA, hereinafter referred to as the \u2018European Judicial Network\u2019, shall continue to operate in accordance with the provisions of this Decision.", "Composition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Judicial Network shall be made up, taking into account the constitutional rules, legal traditions and internal structure of each Member State, of the central authorities responsible for international judicial cooperation and the judicial or other competent authorities with specific responsibilities within the context of international cooperation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One or more contact points of each Member State shall be established in accordance with its internal rules and internal division of responsibilities, care being taken to ensure effective coverage of the whole of its territory.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall appoint, among the contact points, a national correspondent for the European Judicial Network.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall appoint a tool correspondent for the European Judicial Network.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall ensure that its contact points have functions in relation to judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adequate knowledge of a language of the European Union other than its own national language, bearing in mind the need to be able to communicate with the contact points in the other Member States.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the liaison magistrates referred to in Council Joint Action 96/277/JHA of 22 April 1996 concerning a framework for the exchange of liaison magistrates to improve judicial cooperation between the Member States of the European Union\u00a0(5) have been appointed in a Member State and have duties analogous to those assigned by Article 4 of this Decision to the contact points, they shall be linked to the European Judicial Network and to the secure telecommunications connection pursuant to Article 9 of this Decision by the Member State appointing the liaison magistrate in each case, in accordance with the procedures to be laid down by that Member State.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall designate a contact point for those areas falling within its sphere of competence.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Judicial Network shall have a Secretariat which shall be responsible for the administration of the Network.", "Manner of operation of the Network\nThe European Judicial Network shall operate in particular in the following three ways:\n(a) it shall facilitate the establishment of appropriate contacts between the contact points in the various Member States in order to carry out the functions laid down in Article 4;\n(b) it shall organise periodic meetings of the Member States representatives in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 5 and 6;\n(c) it shall constantly provide a certain amount of up-to-date background information, in particular by means of an appropriate telecommunications network, under the procedures laid down in Articles 7, 8 and 9.", "Functions of contact points\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contact points shall be active intermediaries with the task of facilitating judicial cooperation between Member States, particularly in actions to combat forms of serious crime.
