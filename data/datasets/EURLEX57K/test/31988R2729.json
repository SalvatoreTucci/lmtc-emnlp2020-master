Applications for premiums shall include the following information:\n(a) as regards the holding:\n- the applicant's name and address,\n- the area he has under vines, whether these be a specialized crop or grown in a mixed system,\n- the areas under vines, in hectares, ares and centiares, to be grubbed up,\n- the age and method of training of the vines to be grubbed up,\n- the varieties concerned,\n- the date of scheduled grubbing up,\n- the request for an advance, if applicable; if this is the case, proof that the secujrity has been furnished shall accompany the request;\n(b) as regards the owner(s):\n- his/her/their name(s) and address(es),\n- the information needed to identify the plot on which wine growing is to cease definitively and for which the premium is being requested,\n- the written agreement of the owner of the area, as mentioned in Article 4 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88, where applicable.\n2.

For the purpose of calculating the exemption provided for in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88:\n- the decrease in the production potential of the grower who has grubbed up his vines shall be the product of the yield determined in accordance with Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88 and the corresponding grubbed-up area,\n- the percentage decrease in potential table-wine shall be as described in Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88.\nThe average table-wine production declared for the holding in question over the five years preceding the grubbing-up operation shall be calculated by multiplying the grower's total wine-growing area at the time the application for grubbing up is made by the average wine yield for the holding as a whole; the average shall be obtained using the harvest declarations, production declarations or declarations of deliveries to wine cooperatives, as appropriate, covering the five wine years preceding grubbing up, but disregarding the highest and lowest yield figures for that period.\n2. The size of the exemption entitlement for decreases in production potential as provided for in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88 shall be calculated by multiplying the decrease in production potential by the exemption factor corresponding to the percentage of capacity that decrease represents, as listed in Annex II hereto.\nThe size of the exemption shall under no circumstances exceed that of the potential remaining once grubbing up has been carried out. 3. The exemption provided for in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88 shall apply with effect from the wine year following that in which grubbing up has taken place, and shall be granted to the grower who performed this operation and submitted an application by the end of the August preceding the beginning of that wine year.\nFor each wine year, the obligation referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall apply to the size of the grower's output less the size of the exemption.", "By way of derogation from Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88 and from Article 7 of this Regulation, the period of five wine years shall be decreased, in the case of Spain, to three wine years for the 1988/89 wine year, and to four wine years for the 1989/90 wine year. The requirement that the highest-producing and lowest-producing years be disregarded shall also be waived.", "In the case of wine cooperatives or associations of wine-growers which make a single production declaration for their members as a body, the size of the exemption from the obligation referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall be equal to the sum of the individual exemptions granted to each of the members who has grubbed up; in cases where a member has not turned his entire production over to the cooperative, each exemption shall be weighted according to the average annual contribution the member has made to the cooperative expressed as a percentage of the quantity declared as harvested over the five wine years preceding grubbing up. However, the highest and lowest percentages shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the average.", "0\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the total extent of exemption from the obligation referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 at the latest by 31 October of the year in which grubbing up has taken place.
