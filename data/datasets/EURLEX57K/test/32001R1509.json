Application of the euro conversion rate throughout the 2000/01 marketing year would therefore result in the retroactive application of a different rate from that which would be fixed if the method established by Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93 were applied to Greece, and would fail to recognise the legitimate expectations operators have concerning the calculation method for conversion rates applicable to certain payments in the sugar sector.\n(3) Two conversion rates should therefore be applied to the 2000/01 marketing year in the case of Greece, one for the period 1 July to 31 December 2000 equivalent to the average, pro rata temporis, of the agrimonetary conversion rates and the euro conversion rate during that marketing year, and, for the period 1 January to 30 June 2001, the euro exchange rate fixed by Regulation (EC) No 2866/98.\n(4) To permit application to those payments of the rate resulting from the average pro rata temporis of the above conversion rates, special operative events for the amounts due under the minimum sugarbeet prices and the production and additional levies should also be fixed.\n(5) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The following Article 1b is inserted in Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93: \"Article 1b\nFor the 2000/01 marketing year and for Greece,\n1. the following rates are applicable for the conversion of the minimum sugarbeet prices referred to in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999(9) and the production levies and additional levy referred to, respectively, in Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation:\n- for the period 1 July to 31 December 2000 the special agricultural conversion rate: EUR 1 = GRD 339,771,\n- for the period 1 January to 30 June 2001 the conversion rate fixed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2866/98(10);\n2. the following operative events shall be established for the application of the rates referred to in point (1):\n- for the amounts due as payment of the minimum sugarbeet prices referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999: the first day of the marketing year,\n- for the amounts due as payment of the production levy and the additional levy referred to, respectively, in Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation: the first day of the marketing year.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to the amounts due as minimum sugarbeet prices and production and additional levies during the 2000/01 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 July 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 94.\n(3) OJ L 195, 28.7.1999, p. 3.\n(4) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n(5) OJ L 127, 9.5.2001, p. 28.\n(6) OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1.\n(7) OJ L 359, 31.12.1998, p. 1.\n(8) OJ L 167, 7.7.2000, p. 1.\n(9) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n(10) OJ L 359, 31.12.1998, p. 1."}
