whereas these derogations are subject to approval, under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 14 (2) and must also comply with the conditions laid down in Annex IV, part A (24);\nWhereas in Greece, Italy and Portugal the growing of potatoes of certain North American varieties has been an established practice; whereas part of the supply of seed potatoes of these varieties has been ensured by imports from Canada;\nWhereas, by Decisions 86/120/EEC (3), 87/154/EEC (4), as amended by Decision 87/311/EEC (5), 88/176/EEC (6), as amended by Decision 88/496/EEC (7), 89/32/EEC (8) and 89/599/EEC (9), as last amended by Decision 92/468/EEC (10), the Commission approved  derogations based on the concept of 'area freedom', subject to certain technical conditions to prevent the risk of harmful organisms spreading; whereas that approval expired on 31 December 1992; whereas the Commission also provided that those  derogations would provide for the opportunity to seek confirmation of the proper functioning of the concept of 'area freedom';\nWhereas Greece, Italy and Portugal have stated that they intend to provide for derogations for the next seed-potato marketing season;\nWhereas it is known that Canada is still not free from potato spindle tuber viroid or from Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas Canada has further developed its programme to eradicate these harmful organisms in the provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; whereas there are good reasons to believe that the programme to eradicate potato spindle tuber viroid has  become fully effective in these provinces, and that the programme to eradicate Corynebacterium sepedonicum has become fully effective in certain areas of these provinces; whereas there have been no findings of the disease on samples drawn from seed  potatoes imported pursuant to Decision 91/592/EEC; whereas it has not been established that there are sufficient elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'area freedom' and therefore against the  recognition of the provisions implemented there as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas it can therefore be established that there is no risk of the harmful organisms in question spreading, provided that the seed potatoes originate in areas declared, on scientific evidence, free from both potato spindle tuber viroid and from  Corynebacterium sepedonicum, and that certain improved special technical conditions are complied with; whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada makes all technical information available which is necessary to monitor the functioning of the  protective measures required under the aforementioned technical conditions and to assess the functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'area freedom';\nWhereas, therefore, the derogations provided for by Greece, Italy and Portugal should be approved for the next seed-potato marketing season, provided that they include the aforementioned conditions and without prejudice to Council Directive 66/403/EEC  (11), as last amended by Directive 92/17/EEC (12), and to Directive 70/457/EEC (13), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (14);\nWhereas the conditions laid down in the said Annex IV, part A point 24 have been subjected to a review taking into account a pest risk assessment to adapt the relevant Annex entry to the single market concept;\nWhereas that pest risk assessment has been the basis for an amendment and revision of the relevant Annex IV to the said Directive;\nWhereas, however, according to the provisions of Council Directive 91/683/EEC (15) Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 91/683/EEC six months after the revisions of  Annexes I to V to Directive 77/93/EEC;\nWhereas it appears that the revision has been delayed;\nWhereas the authorization is applicable without prejudice to the abolition of the intra-Community border controls from 1 January 1993;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 89/599/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1 (2) (f), '15 January 1993' is replaced by '15 April 1993';\n2. in Article 2, '1 March 1993' is replaced by '1 June 1993';\n3. in Article 3, '1 November 1992 until 31 December 1992' is replaced by '31 March 1993';\n4. in Article 3, '31 December 1992' is replaced by '31 March 1993'.", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic, to the Italian Republic and to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 1992.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 26, 31. 1. 1977, p. 20.\n(2) OJ No L 363, 11. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 99, 15. 4. 1986, p. 31.\n(4) OJ No L 65, 10. 3. 1987, p. 12.\n(5) OJ No L 159, 19. 6. 1987, p. 19.\n(6) OJ No L 80, 25. 3. 1988, p. 48.\n(7) OJ No L 266, 27. 9. 1988, p. 39.\n(8) OJ No L 15, 19. 1. 1989, p. 21.\n(9) OJ No L 344, 25. 11. 1989, p. 31.\n(10) OJ No L 264, 10. 9. 1992, p. 25.\n(11) OJ No 125, 11. 7. 1966, p. 2360/66.\n(12) OJ No L 82, 27. 3. 1992, p. 69.\n(13) OJ No L 225, 12. 10. 1970, p. 1.\n(14) OJ No L 353, 17. 12. 1990, p. 48.\n(15) OJ No L 376, 31. 12. 1991, p. 29."}
