The contribution of EEA/EFTA countries was estimated at EUR 912\u00a0000. The contribution of one Applicant Country (Turkey) was estimated at EUR 958\u00a0000. The total budget for 2007 was estimated at EUR 41\u00a0870\u00a0000. The total indicative amount for the call for proposals was estimated at EUR 33\u00a0888\u00a0000. The overall indicative amount for the call for tenders was EUR 4\u00a0064\u00a0000.\n(3) The contribution received from EEA/EFTA countries amounted to EUR 884\u00a0640. The contribution to be received from one Applicant Country (Turkey) amounted to EUR 957\u00a0697. The following former candidate countries, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia contributed to the Public Health Programme on the basis of the Enlargement Protocols for an amount of EUR 7\u00a0133\u00a0382,18, of which EUR 1\u00a0226\u00a0395,90 were committed in the previous years of the abovementioned Programme. The amount of EUR 5\u00a0906\u00a0986,28 is therefore still available for financing actions in 2007.\n(4) The total budget available for 2007 is therefore EUR 47\u00a0749\u00a0323,28. The total amount for the call for proposals is EUR 37\u00a0888\u00a0963. The total amount for the call for tenders is EUR 5\u00a0324\u00a0000.\n(5) The actions initially foreseen for 2007 with the cooperation of the OECD will be postponed to 2008, therefore a part of the budget allocated to finance direct grant agreements with the OECD is now available for other actions in 2007. Three actions are foreseen with the cooperation of the WHO and one action with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for a total amount of EUR 2\u00a0550\u00a0000 instead of the initial amount estimated at EUR 2\u00a0032\u00a0000.\n(6) In the light of the increased budget made available, it is therefore necessary to amend the Work Plan for 2007 to finance a larger number of tenders, projects under the 2007 Call for Proposals and of direct grant agreements with international organisations.\n(7) Furthermore, since in 2007 final budget item 17\u00a003\u00a001\u00a001 did not have the necessary commitment allocation, the relevant amount available under budget article 17\u00a003\u00a006 was transferred to item 17\u00a003\u00a001\u00a001 at the beginning of the budget year.\n(8) The expenditure for administrative management of the programme is covered by budget item 17\u00a001\u00a004\u00a002\u00a0(4).\n(9) The Public Health Programme Committee gave a favourable opinion on this draft Decision.\n(10) Commission Decision 2007/102/EC\u00a0(5) should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2007/102/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
