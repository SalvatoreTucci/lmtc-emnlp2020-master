whereas these duties are reduced to 62,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1988 and to 50 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1989; whereas, by way of derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Council Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 443/86 of 24 February 1986 concerning the basic duties to be adopted in the Community of Ten for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal(1), provides that the basic duties are those actually applied on 1 January 1986; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the import of these wines, Community tariff quotas should be opened for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 for:\n-358 120 hectolitres for quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 41 and ex 2204 21 51, and\n-435 000 hectolitres for quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez falling within CN codes ex 2204 29 41 and ex 2204 29 51 at duties as shown in the list in Article 1;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade in agricultural products between Spain and Portugal(2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question, coming from Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quotas are applicable only in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for these quotas to all imports of the product concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quotas can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quotas among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the actual trend of the market in the product concerned, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports of the said product from Spain over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports of sherry into Member States are broken down as shown in the following table:\n>TABLE>\nWhereas in the last three years the products in question were imported regularly only by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be allocated to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports actually take place in those Member States; whereas these allocation arrangements will equally ensure the uniform application of the combined nomenclature duties;\nWhereas, in view of these factors and of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:\n>TABLE>\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, each quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover the subsequent requirements of those Member States which have used up their initial share and also any additional requirements which might arise in other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first part of the Community quotas should, under the circumstances, be fixed at 67 % respectively of each quota volume;\nWhereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up one of its initial shares must draw an additional share from the corresponding reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost entirely used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volumes have been used up and inform the Member States thereof;\nWhereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a considerable quantity is left over in one or other Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve to prevent a part of the Community quotas from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["From 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 the customs duties applicable on the following quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez shall, in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985, be partially suspended at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas indicated for each of them:\n>TABLE>", "1.
