A \"complete industrial plant\" shall be regarded as meaning a combination of machines, apparatus, appliances, equipment, instruments and materials, hereinafter referred to as \"component parts\", which normally fall under various headings of the Customs Cooperation Council nomenclature, hereinafter referred to as the \"CCCN\", and which are designed to function together as a large-scale unit to produce goods or to provide services.\n2. All other goods within the meaning of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75 which are to be used in constructing a complete industrial plant may be treated as component parts thereof, provided they are not excluded from the statistical compilation by virtue of that Regulation.", "1. The procedure set out below may be followed only for the exportation of a complete industrial plant of which the total value exceeds 1 75 million European units of account, unless plant other than new plant is involved or unless other criteria justify the use of this procedure.\nMember States shall inform the Commission of other criteria which have been applied. The Commission shall conveny such information to the other Member States.\n2.

The Commission shall inform the other Member States of such authorizations.\n2. Component parts falling within a given chapter shall be classified under the complete industrial plant heading for that chapter unless the competent department as specified in Article 7 decides to classify the goods under the appropriate complete industrial plant headings at the level of the headings of the CCCN or to apply the provisions of paragraph 3.\nHowever, the simplified procedure shall not prevent the competent department from classifying certain component parts under the relevant ordinary NIMEXE headings. Each Member State shall submit a list of these headings annually to the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States thereof.\n3. Complete industrial plant headings are hereby created at the level of Chapter 99 of the NIMEXE for the purposes of declaring component parts and other goods whose value is considered by the competent department specified in Article 7 to be too low to justify their inclusion under the complete industrial plant headings of the chapters under which they fall.", "The component department specified in Article 7 shall prescribe the description and the code number to be used in the statistical information media to distinguish the component parts of a complete industrial plant.", "Code numbers for complete industrial plant headings shall be composed in accordance with the following rules:    1.

In other cases, the competent department of each Member State shall authorize application of the simplified procedure in respect of its own exports which concern it. However, such authorization may be issued only on presentation of documentary evidence that the total statistical value specified in Article 3 (1) is reached or that other criteria justify the use of the simplified procedure.\n4.
