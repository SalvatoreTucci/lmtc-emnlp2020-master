Consequently, imports are only allowed for those specific uses. Member States can decide which of those uses allowed under Directive 98/8/EC they authorise in their territory.\n(6) Fluoroacetamide and pentachlorophenol and its salts and esters are not included as active substances in Annex\u00a0I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15\u00a0July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market\u00a0(6) or in Annex\u00a0I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC, with the effect that those active substances are banned for pesticide use. Consequently, it is prohibited to import fluoroacetamide and pentachlorophenol and its salts and esters for use as pesticides.\n(7) Since 1\u00a0July 2008 methamidophos is no longer included in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC, with the effect that all authorisations for plant protection products containing methamidophos had to be withdrawn by Member States and that any placing on the market of plant protection products containing methamidophos is prohibited. Furthermore, methamidophos has not been identified or notified under the Community review programme for evaluation of existing substances under Directive\u00a098/8/EC and is therefore not allowed to be placed on the market for use as a biocidal product.\n(8) The production, placing on the market and use of lindane and HCH (mixed isomers) were prohibited by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC\u00a0(7) and the derogation allowed for under that Regulation expired on 31\u00a0December 2007. Consequently, any import of those chemicals is prohibited as from that date.\n(9) Any production, placing on the market and use of hexabromo-1,1\u2019-biphenyl is banned. Furthermore, that chemical belongs to the group of PBBs, which is included in Annex\u00a0III to the Rotterdam Convention and subject to the PIC procedure.\n(10) Bulgaria and Romania became Member States of the European Union on 1\u00a0January 2007. Since Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006 allows the Member States to authorise specific uses of PCTs in their territory, the import decision should be revised to reflect national legislation in those two new Member States.\n(11) It is therefore appropriate to replace the import decisions for ethylene oxide, fluoroacetamide, HCH (mixed isomers), lindane, methamidophos, pentachlorophenol and its salts and esters, PBBs and PCTs set out in Commission Decision 2000/657/EC of 16\u00a0October 2000 adopting Community import decisions for certain chemicals pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02455/92 concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals\u00a0(8), Commission Decision 2001/852/EC of 19\u00a0November 2001 on adopting Community import decisions pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02455/92 concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals and amending Decision 2000/657/EC\u00a0(9), Commission Decision 2003/508/EC of 7\u00a0July 2003 adopting Community import decisions for certain chemicals pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Decisions 2000/657/EC and\u00a02001/852/EC\u00a0(10) and Commission Decision 2005/416/EC of 19\u00a0May 2005 adopting Community import decisions for certain chemicals pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Decisions 2000/657/EC, 2001/852/EC and\u00a02003/508/EC\u00a0(11).\n(12) Benomyl is not included as active substance in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC or in Annex\u00a0I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC, with the effect that that active substance is banned for pesticide use. Consequently, dustable powder pesticide formulations containing a combination of benomyl, carbofuran and thiram are banned for placing on the market and use as pesticide. The import decision for dustable powder pesticide formulations containing a combination of benomyl, carbofuran and thiram set out in Commission Decision 2004/382/EC of 26\u00a0April 2004 adopting Community import decisions for certain chemicals pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(12) should therefore be replaced.\n(13) The placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing mercury compounds as an active substance is prohibited pursuant to Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21\u00a0December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances\u00a0(13). Furthermore, the placing on the market and use of biocidal products containing mercury compounds in accordance with Directive 98/8/EC is not allowed. The import decision for mercury compounds published in PIC Circular X should therefore be replaced.\n(14) Decisions 2000/657/EC, 2001/852/EC, 2003/508/EC, 2004/382/EC and\u00a02005/416/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The decisions on the import of lindane, methamidophos and pentachlorophenol and its salts and esters as set out in the Annex to Decision 2000/657/EC are replaced by the import decisions set out in the forms for import response in Annex\u00a0I to this Decision.", "The decision on the import of ethylene oxide as set out in Annex\u00a0I to Decision 2001/852/EC is replaced by the import decision set out in the form for import response in Annex\u00a0II to this Decision.", "The decision on the import of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) as set out in Annex\u00a0III to Decision 2003/508/EC is replaced by the import decision set out in the form for import response in Annex\u00a0III to this Decision.", "The decisions on the import of fluoroacetamide, HCH (mixed isomers) and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs) as set out in Annex\u00a0I to Decision 2005/416/EC are replaced by the import decisions set out in the forms for import response in Annex\u00a0IV to this Decision.", "The interim decision on the import of dustable powder formulations containing a combination of benomyl, carbofuran and thiram as set out in Annex\u00a0III to Decision 2004/382/EC is replaced by the import decision set out in the form for import response in Annex\u00a0V to this Decision.", "The decision on the import of mercury compounds published in PIC Circular X is replaced by the import decision set out in the form for import response in Annex\u00a0VI to this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30\u00a0November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0204, 31.7.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0396, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0299, 28.10.2006, p.\u00a023.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a03.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0158, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a07.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0275, 27.10.2000, p.\u00a044.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0318, 4.12.2001, p.\u00a028.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0174, 12.7.2003, p.\u00a010.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0147, 10.6.2005, p.\u00a01.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a0144, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a011.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a033, 8.2.1979, p.\u00a036.\nANNEX\u00a0I\nRevised import decisions for lindane, methamidophos and pentachlorophenol and its salts and esters replacing the import decisions set out in Decision 2000/657/EC\nANNEX\u00a0II\nRevised import decision for ethylene oxide replacing the import decision set out in Decision 2001/852/EC\nANNEX\u00a0III\nRevised import decision for polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) replacing the import decision set out in Decision 2003/508/EC\nANNEX\u00a0IV\nRevised import decisions for fluoroacetamide, HCH (mixed isomers) and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs) replacing the import decisions set out in Decision 2005/416/EC\nANNEX\u00a0V\nRevised import decision for dustable powder formulations containing a combination of benomyl, carbofuran and thiram replacing the import decision set out in Decision 2004/382/EC\nANNEX\u00a0VI\nRevised import decision for mercury compounds replacing the import decision published in PIC Circular X"}
