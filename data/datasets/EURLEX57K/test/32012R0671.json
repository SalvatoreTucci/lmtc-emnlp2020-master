Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(4) should continue to form the basis on which to grant income support for farmers in calendar year 2013.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 established a system of compulsory, progressive reduction of direct payments (\u2018modulation\u2019) including an exemption of direct payments of up to EUR 5\u00a0000 which is to apply until calendar year 2012. As a consequence, the total net amounts of direct payments (\u2018net ceilings\u2019) which may be granted in a Member State, after the application of modulation, have been fixed until calendar year 2012. In order to maintain the amount of direct payments in calendar year 2013 on a level similar to that of 2012, with due account being taken of phasing-in in the new Member States, within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, it is appropriate to establish an adjustment mechanism for calendar year 2013 with an effect equivalent to that of modulation and the net ceilings. Due to the special characteristics of the support in the outermost regions under the common agricultural policy, this adjustment mechanism should not be applied to farmers in those regions.\n(3) For the smooth functioning of the direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013, it is necessary to extend the net ceilings set for calendar year 2012 to 2013 and to adjust them, where necessary, in particular as regards the increases resulting from the phasing-in of direct payments in the new Member States.\n(4) In parallel with compulsory modulation, Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 of 27 March 2007 laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(5) made it possible for Member States to apply a reduction (\u2018voluntary modulation\u2019) to all amounts of direct payments to be granted in their territory in respect of a given calendar year until calendar year 2012. In order to maintain the amount of direct payments to be made in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013 on a level similar to that of 2012, Member States which made use of voluntary modulation in respect of calendar year 2012 should continue to have the possibility to reduce direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013 and to use the funds generated thereby to finance rural development programmes. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to further reduce the amount of direct payments by applying a system of voluntary adjustment of direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013. Such reduction should be in addition to the compulsory adjustment of direct payment foreseen in respect of calendar year 2013.\n(5) Where a Member State has applied regionally differentiated voluntary modulation rates in respect of calendar year 2012, it should also have that possibility in respect of calendar year 2013. In order to safeguard the level of direct support to farmers, the combined application of the compulsory and voluntary adjustment of direct payments in calendar year 2013 should not lead to a reduction of direct payment in excess of the reductions applied in 2012, through both compulsory and voluntary modulation. Therefore, the maximum rate of adjustment of direct payments to be applied in respect of calendar year 2013 in each region should not exceed the reductions resulting from both compulsory and voluntary modulation, as applied in respect of calendar year 2012.\n(6) Where a Member State made use of the option provided for in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 378/2007 by deciding not to apply the maximum rate for the contribution from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to the net amounts resulting from the application of voluntary modulation in the programming period 2007 to 2013, the same option should be made available to that Member State in respect of the funds raised through the voluntary adjustment of direct payments, in order to ensure continuity in the financing of public expenditure of the rural development measures in 2014. For reasons of consistency, the prefinancing arrangements for the rural development programmes should not apply to such funds.\n(7) According to the phasing-in mechanism provided for in the Act of Accession of 2005, the level of direct payments in Bulgaria and Romania continues to be below the level of direct payments applicable in the other Member States in 2013 after application of the adjustment of payments to farmers in the transitional period. Therefore, the adjustment mechanism should not apply to farmers in Bulgaria and Romania.\n(8) The new Member States were allowed to grant complementary national direct payments as a consequence of the phasing-in of direct payments in those Member States. Such possibility will no longer be available in 2013, when the schedule for the gradual introduction of direct payments in the new Member States will be complete. In the new Member States applying the single area payment scheme, the complementary national direct payments have played an important role in supporting the income of farmers in specific sectors. As regards Cyprus, the same can be said of State aids. For that reason, and in order to avoid a sudden and substantial decrease of support in 2013 in those sectors benefiting, until 2012, from complementary national direct payments and, in the case of Cyprus, from State aids, it is appropriate to provide, in those Member States, for the possibility to grant, subject to authorisation by the Commission, transitional national aids to farmers in 2013. In order to ensure the continuity of the level of support to farmers in 2013, only those sectors that benefited, in 2012, from complementary national direct payments and, in the case of Cyprus, from State aids should be eligible for the transitional national aid, and if that transitional aid is granted, it should be granted under the same conditions as the ones applied to those payments in 2012.\n(9) The financial transfers to the EAFRD provided for in Articles 134 and 135 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 relate to the 2007-13 multiannual financial framework. The direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in calendar year 2013 will have effects in financial year 2014, thereby falling under the next multiannual financial framework. Under that framework, the amounts available for rural development programming already include the amounts corresponding to the financial transfers provided for in Articles 134 and 135 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. Therefore, such financial transfers should be abolished.\n(10) In order to facilitate the more efficient use of the funds, Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 provided for the possibility for Member States to grant support above their national ceilings up to an amount the level of which ensures that it remains within the margins of the under-execution of the national ceiling. That Regulation provided for those amounts either to be used for the funding of specific support or to be transferred to the EAFRD under Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. As the possibility to grant support above the national ceilings will be abolished when the new direct support system becomes applicable, the financial transfer to the EAFRD provided for in Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should be maintained only until 31 December 2013.\n(11) The possibility to make the amounts resulting from the application of voluntary adjustment available as an additional Union support under rural development programming and financing under EAFRD for financial year 2014 and the prolongation of the financial transfers provided for in Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should not affect the future adjustment of the level of direct payments with a view to a more equal distribution of direct support among Member States which is foreseen to be part of the new direct support system.\n(12) In the context of respecting budget discipline, it is necessary to define, for the financial year 2014, the ceiling for the expenditure financed by the EAGF, by taking into account the maximum amounts set in the Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 312(2) of the Treaty and the amounts resulting from the voluntary adjustment, along with the amounts resulting from the application of Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for that financial year.\n(13) In order to ensure the correct application of the adjustments of direct payments to be made by the Member States in respect of applications made in 2013 and financial discipline for calendar year 2013, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the relevant rules concerning the basis of calculation for reductions to be applied to the farmers by the Member States. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(14) Under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Member States had the possibility to decide to use, from the following year, a certain percentage of their national ceiling for specific support for their farmers as well as to review a previous decision by deciding to modify, or put an end to, such support. It is appropriate to provide for an additional review of those decisions with effect for calendar year 2013.\n(15) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the presentation of the amounts resulting from the voluntary adjustment. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers\u00a0(6).\n(16) In respect of fixing the amounts resulting from voluntary adjustment, setting the net balance available for EAGF expenditure in respect of financial year 2014 and authorising the granting of transitional national aids, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(17) Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Article 8 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(b) in paragraph 2, point (d) is deleted;\n(2) the following Articles are inserted:\n(a) the rate of voluntary adjustment for the whole territory and, where applicable, for each region;\n(b) the total amount to be reduced under voluntary adjustment for the whole territory and, where applicable, for each region.\n(3) in Article 11(1), the following subparagraph is added:\n(4) in Article 11, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(5) the following Article is inserted:\n(6) in Article 68(8), the introductory phrase is replaced by the following:\n(7) Article 69(1) is replaced by the following:\n(8) Article 131(1) is replaced by the following:\n(9) the following Article is inserted:\n(a) the total direct support which may be granted to farmers in the relevant sector in 2012, including all payments received pursuant to Article 132; and\n(b) the total amount of direct support that would be available for the same sector under the single area payment scheme in 2013.\n(a) setting the financial envelope per sector;\n(b) setting the maximum rate of transitional national aid where appropriate;\n(c) setting the conditions for the granting thereof; and\n(d) defining the applicable exchange rate to be used for the payments.\n(10) Articles 134 and 135 are deleted;\n(11) Article 136 is deleted;\n(12) Article 139 is replaced by the following:\n(13) the following Articles are inserted:\n(14) in Annex IV, the following column is added:\n\u20182013\n569\n903\n964,3\n5\u00a0329,6\n101,2\n1\u00a0255,5\n2\u00a0344,5\n5\u00a0055,2\n7\u00a0853,1\n4\u00a0128,3\n53,5\n146,4\n379,8\n34,7\n1\u00a0313,1\n5,5\n830,6\n715,7\n3\u00a0043,4\n566,6\n144,3\n385,6\n539,2\n708,5\n3\u00a0650\u2019\n(15) the following Annex is inserted:\n(EUR)\nSector 2013\nCereals (durum wheat excluded) 141\u00a0439\nDurum wheat 905\u00a0191\nMilk and dairy 3\u00a0419\u00a0585\nBeef 4\u00a0608\u00a0945\nSheep and goats 10\u00a0572\u00a0527\nPig sector 170\u00a0788\nPoultry and eggs 71\u00a0399\nWine 269\u00a0250\nOlive oil 3\u00a0949\u00a0554\nTable grapes 66\u00a0181\nDried grapes 129\u00a0404\nProcessed tomatoes 7\u00a0341\nBananas 4\u00a0285\u00a0696\nTobacco 1\u00a0027\u00a0775\nDeciduous fruit including stone fruit 173\u00a0390\nTotal 29\u00a0798\u00a0462\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nBy way of derogation from the second paragraph:\n(a) the following provisions shall apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation:\n(i) Article 10b(5), Article 10c(1) and (4) and Article 10d(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, as inserted by point (2) of Article 1 of this Regulation;\n(ii) Article 133a(5) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, as inserted by point (9) of Article 1 of this Regulation;\n(iii) points (5), (6), (7), (8) and (13) of Article 1 of this Regulation;\n(b) points (1)(b) and (11) of Article 1 of this Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 July 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
