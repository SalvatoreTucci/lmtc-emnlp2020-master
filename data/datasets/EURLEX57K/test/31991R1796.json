Warp-knit fabric.\nThe warp consists of:\n- a yarn of white colour which forms the loops;\n- translucent strips of synthetic textile material of an apparent width not exceeding 5 mm.  6002 43 31  Classification is determined by virtue of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, by Subheading Notes 1 (c) (i)  and 2.A of Section XI and by the wording of CN codes 6002, 6002 43 and 6002 43 31.  The weft is formed by one yearn of white colour. The yarns (warp and weft) of synthetic fibre represent 54 % by weight of the fabric. The translucent strips represent 46  % by weight of the fabric. This fabric is of the kind used for the manufacture of screens for greenhouses. (see sketch A) (*)    2. Warp-knit fabric.\nThe warp consists of:\n- a yarn of white colour which forms the loops;\n- strips of synthetic material covered with aluminium of an apparent width not exceeding 5 mm.  6002 49 00  Classification is determined by virtue of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, by Subheading Notes 1 (c)  (i) and 2.A of Section XI and by the wording of CN codes 6002 and 6002 49 00.  The weft is formed by one yarn of white colour. The yarns (warp and weft) of synthetic fibre represent 36 % by weight of the fabric. The strips of synthetic material covered  with aluminium represent 64 % by weight of the fabric. This fabric is of the kind used for the manufacture of screens for greenhouses.

Warp-knit fabric.\nThe warp consists of:\n- a yarn of white colour which forms the loops;\n- translucent strips of synthetic textile material of an apparent width not exceeding 5 mm\n- strips of synthetic material covered with aluminium of an apparent width not exceeding 5 mm.  6002 43 31  Classification is determined by virtue of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, by Subheading Notes 1 (c)  (i) and 2./A of Section XI and by the wording of CN codes 6002, 6002 43 and 6002 43 31.  The weft is formed by one yarn of white colour. The yarns (warp and weft) of synthetic fibre represent 50 % by weight of the fabric. The translucent strips  represent 33 % by weight of the fabric. The strips made of synthetic textile covered with aluminium represent 17 % by weight of the fabric. This fabric is of the kind used for the manufacture of screens for greenhouses (see sketch C) (*)    4. Pieces of  non-wovens and of stitch-bonded goods, of various textile fibres, of small dimensions, roughly cut, either square or rectangular (generally 30-35 cms) or irregularly shaped. The pieces, some of which are worn, soiled or torn, are put up unsorted in  bales (rags).  6310 90 00  Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the texts of CN codes 6310 and 6310 90 00. These goods cannot be re-used as such and are fit only  for the recovery of the fibres, the manufacture of paper or plastics, the manufacture of polishing materials, or for use as industrial wipers.  5. Pieces of non-wovens and of stitch-bonded goods, of various textile fibres, roughly cut. These pieces,  some of which are worn, soiled or torn, are put up unsorted in bales. The bales contain small irregularly shaped pieces (approximately 30-35 cms) and a negligible quantity of larger dimensions (rags).  6310 90 00  Classification is determined by the  provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the texts of CN codes 6310 and 6310 90 00.
