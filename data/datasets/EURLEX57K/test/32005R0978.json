At present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 2001/870/EC\u00a0(2) with the ACP States referred to in Protocol No 3 on ACP sugar\u00a0(3) attached to Annex V to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and with the Republic of India.\n(2) The agreements in the form of an exchange of letters concluded by Decision 2001/870/EC lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question. This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2005/2006 marketing year.\n(3) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance. The balance indicates the need to import raw sugar and to open for the 2005/2006 marketing year tariff quotas at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the above agreements so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met for part of the year.\n(4) In view of the forecasts for raw cane sugar production which are now available for the 2005/2006 marketing year and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorise imports for the period 1 July 2005 to 28 February 2006.\n(5) It should be stipulated that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 of 30 June 2003 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2003/2004, 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 marketing years for the import of cane sugar under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements and amending Regulations (EC) No 1464/95 and (EC) No 779/96\u00a0(4) applies to the new quota.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The following quotas are hereby opened for the period 1 July 2005 to 28 February 2006 pursuant to Decision 2001/870/EC in respect of imports of raw cane sugar for refining falling within CN code 1701\u00a011\u00a010:\n(a) a tariff quota of 90\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the ACP States parties to the agreements in the form of an exchange of letters approved by Decision 2001/870/EC;\n(b) a tariff quota of 10\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in India.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The special reduced duty per 100\u00a0kg of standard-quality raw sugar applying to imports of the quantities referred to in Article 1 shall be EUR\u00a00.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The minimum purchase price to be paid by Community refiners for the period referred to in Article 1 shall be EUR\u00a049,68 per 100\u00a0kg of standard-quality raw sugar.", "Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 shall apply to the tariff quota opened by this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.
