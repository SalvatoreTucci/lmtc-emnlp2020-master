Developments in the best available and economically justifiable technology which were observed during the period covered by this analysis indicate that for the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity, a distinction should be drawn relating to the year of construction of a cogeneration unit. Furthermore, correction factors relating to the climatic situation should be applied to these reference values because the thermodynamics of generating electricity from fuel depend on the ambient temperature. In addition correction factors for avoided grid losses should be applied to these reference values to take account of the energy savings obtained when grid use is limited due to decentralised production.\n(3) By contrast, the analysis showed that concerning the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of heat a distinction relating to the year of construction was not necessary as the net energy efficiency of boilers has hardly improved in the period covered by the analysis. No correction factors relating to the climatic situation were required because the thermodynamics of generating heat from fuel do not depend on the ambient temperature. In addition correction factors for heat grid losses are not required as heat is always used near the site of production.\n(4) The harmonised efficiency reference values have been based on the principles mentioned in Annex III (f) of Directive 2004/8/EC.\n(5) Stable conditions for investment in cogeneration and continued investor confidence are needed. In this perspective it is appropriate to maintain the same reference values for a cogeneration unit for a reasonably long period of ten years. However, taking into consideration the main aim of Directive 2004/8/EC to promote cogeneration in order to save primary energy, an incentive for retrofitting older cogeneration units should be given in order to improve their energy efficiency. For these reasons the efficiency reference values for electricity applicable to a cogeneration unit should become stricter from the eleventh year after the year of its construction.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Cogeneration Committee,", "main_body": ["Establishment of the harmonised efficiency reference values\nThe harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat shall be as set out in Annex I and Annex II respectively.", "Correction factors for the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall apply the correction factors set out in Annex III(a) in order to adapt the harmonised efficiency reference values set out in Annex I to the average climatic situation in each Member State.\nThe correction factors for the average climatic situation shall not apply to fuel cell-based cogeneration technology.\nIf on the territory of a Member State official meteorological data show differences in the annual ambient temperature of 5\u00a0oC or more, that Member State may, subject to notification to the Commission, use several climate zones for the purpose of the first subparagraph using the method set out in Annex III(b).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall apply the correction factors set out in Annex IV in order to adapt the harmonised efficiency reference values set out in Annex I to avoided grid losses.\nThe correction factors for avoided grid losses shall not apply to wood fuels and biogas.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Member States apply both the correction factors set out in Annex III(a) and those set out in Annex IV, they shall apply Annex III(a) before applying Annex IV.", "Application of the harmonised efficiency reference values\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall apply the harmonised efficiency reference values set out in Annex I relating to the year of construction of a cogeneration unit.
