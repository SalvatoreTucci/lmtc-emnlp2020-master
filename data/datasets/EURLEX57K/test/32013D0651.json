That plan was approved by Commission Decision 2008/838/EC\u00a0(5). Further preventive vaccination plans against low pathogenic avian influenza submitted by Portugal were approved by Commission Decision 2010/189/EU\u00a0(6) and Commission Implementing Decision 2012/110/EU\u00a0(7).\n(7) The plan for preventive vaccination against low pathogenic avian influenza approved by Implementing Decision 2012/110/EU was implemented by Portugal until 31 July 2013. As provided for in Article 8 of that Decision, Portugal submitted a report on the implementation of that plan to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. That report demonstrated that virus circulation was successfully prevented in the vaccinated mallard flocks as well as in poultry holdings located in the surrounding area.\n(8) On 26 August 2013, Portugal submitted a new plan for preventive vaccination against low pathogenic avian influenza to the Commission for approval. That plan is to be applied until 31 December 2014 (\u2018the preventive vaccination plan\u2019).\n(9) Scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority in 2005\u00a0(8), 2007\u00a0(9) and 2008\u00a0(10) have confirmed that preventive vaccination is a valuable tool to complement control measures for avian influenza.\n(10) In addition in order to detect a potential silent virus circulation in vaccinated birds, surveillance and laboratory testing in the holding keeping the vaccinated mallard ducks and unvaccinated sentinel birds should be carried out as set out in the preventive vaccination plan including individual identification of that poultry.\n(11) It is also appropriate to introduce certain restrictions on the movement of vaccinated mallard ducks, their hatching eggs and mallard ducks derived from such ducks in accordance with the preventive vaccination plan. Due to the small number of mallard ducks present on the holding where preventive vaccination is to be carried out, as well as for reasons of traceability and logistics, vaccinated mallard ducks should not be moved from that holding, but killed after the end of their reproductive cycle in accordance with the requirements of Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009\u00a0(11) and safely disposed of in accordance with the requirements set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011\u00a0(12).\n(12) Portugal has taken additional measures pursuant to Commission Decision 2006/605/EC\u00a0(13) for trade in poultry intended for restocking supplies of game.\n(13) To reduce the economic impact on the holding concerned, certain derogations from movement restrictions for mallard ducks derived from vaccinated mallard ducks should be allowed provided that such movements do not increase the risk for the spread of avian influenza and provided that official surveillance is carried out and that the specific animal health requirements for trade within the Union are complied with.\n(14) Considering the epidemiological situation as regards low pathogenic avian influenza in Portugal, the risk associated with the type of holding concerned and the limited scope of the preventive vaccination plan, the plan should be approved and implemented until 31 December 2014.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision lays down certain measures to be applied in Portugal in one holding in the municipality of Vila Nova da Barquinha, region of Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Ribatejo Norte, where preventive vaccination of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) intended for restocking supplies of game (\u2018mallard ducks\u2019) is carried out in a holding, which is exposed to the risk of the introduction of the avian influenza virus.\nThose measures include:\n(a) certain restrictions on the movement within and dispatch from Portugal of the vaccinated mallard ducks, their hatching eggs and mallard ducks derived therefrom;\n(b) the disposal of vaccinated mallard ducks.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision shall apply without prejudice to the protection measures to be taken by Portugal in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC and Decision 2006/605/EC.", "Approval of the preventive vaccination plan\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plan for preventive vaccination against low pathogenic avian influenza in Portugal, as submitted by Portugal to the Commission on 26 August 2013, until 31 December 2014 (\u2018the preventive vaccination plan\u2019) is approved.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall publish the preventive vaccination plan on its website.", "Conditions for implementing the preventive vaccination plan\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Portugal shall ensure that the preventive vaccination plan is implemented by using a monovalent inactivated vaccine containing the avian influenza subtype H5 authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Portugal shall ensure that the preventive vaccination plan is implemented as notified.", "Marking and restrictions on the movement and dispatch and disposal of vaccinated mallard ducks\nPortugal shall ensure that vaccinated mallard ducks on the holding referred to in Article 1(1) are:\n(a) marked individually;\n(b) not moved to other poultry holdings within Portugal;\n(c) not dispatched from Portugal.\nAfter their reproductive period, those mallard ducks shall be killed on the holding referred to in Article 1(1) of this Decision in accordance with the requirements of Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009, and their carcases safely shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 142/2011.", "Restrictions on the movement and dispatch of hatching eggs derived from mallard ducks on the holding referred to in Article 1(1)\nPortugal shall ensure that hatching eggs derived from mallard ducks on the holding referred to in Article 1(1):\n(a) are only moved to a hatchery in Portugal;\n(b) are not dispatched from Portugal.", "Restrictions on the movement and dispatch of mallard ducks derived from vaccinated mallard ducks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Portugal shall ensure that mallard ducks derived from the vaccinated parent mallard ducks are only moved after hatching from the holding referred to in Article 1(1) to a holding located in an area surrounding that holding.\nThat area shall be established and identified by Portugal as set out in the preventive vaccination plan.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, mallard ducks derived from vaccinated parent mallard ducks and provided they are older than four month may be:\n(a) released into the wild in Portugal;
