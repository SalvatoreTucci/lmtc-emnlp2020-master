However, the current published text of Article 6(3) could be interpreted as imposing a less ambitious obligation which could in effect significantly reduce, for the Member States with more than one area control centre, the task of generating additional frequencies.\n(3) The aim of the amendment is to clarify Article 6(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1079/2012, therefore the original date of application of that act should be maintained.\n(4) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1079/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee,", "main_body": ["Article 6(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1079/2012 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States listed in Annex I shall implement, by 31 December 2014 at the latest, a number of new 8,33 kHz channel spacing conversions equivalent to at least 25\u00a0% of the total number of the 25 kHz frequency assignments in the central register and allocated to area control centres (\u201cACC\u201d) in the Member State.
