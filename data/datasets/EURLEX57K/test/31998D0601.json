whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approved certification body is required;\nWhereas Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;\nWhereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;\nWhereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for harmonised standards.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 October 1998.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30. 8. 1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAncillary products (e.g. dowels, joint fillers, joint sealants)\nFor uses in concrete roads\nANNEX II\nBitumen (e.g. pure bitumen, polymer modified bitumen, fluxed bitumen, fluxed polymer modified bitumen, cut-back bitumen, bitumen emulsion, fluxed bitumen emulsion, polymer modified bitumen emulsion, fluxed polymer modified bitumen emulsion, naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen)\nFor uses in road construction and surface treatment of roads\nBituminous mixtures (e.g. asphalt concrete including very soft asphalt and those for very thin layers, porous asphalt, mastic asphalt (Gussasphalt), stone mastic asphalt, hot rolled asphalt)\nFor uses in road construction and surface treatment of roads\nSurface treatments (e.g. slurry for surfacing, microsurfacing, surface dressing)\nFor uses in surface treatment of roads\nBridge deck waterproofing products and kits (e.g. mastic asphalt, prefabricated membranes, preformed bituminous sheets, resins/polyurethane)\nFor uses in bridge decks\nANNEX III\nNote: For products having more than one of the intended uses specified in the following families, the tasks for the approved body, derived from the relevant systems of attestation of conformity, are cumulative.\nPRODUCT FAMILY\nROAD CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS (1/2)\n1.
