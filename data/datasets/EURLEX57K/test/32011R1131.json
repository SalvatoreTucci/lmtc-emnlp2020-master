The Authority established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for steviol glycosides, expressed as steviol equivalents, of 4\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight/day. Conservative estimates of steviol glycosides exposure, both in adults and in children, suggest that it is likely that the ADI would be exceeded at the maximum proposed use levels.\n(3) Taking into account the conclusion of the Authority, the applicants submitted, in September 2010, revised uses and the Authority was requested to consider those uses. A statement on a new exposure assessment was published in January 2011\u00a0(3). Despite the revised uses, the conclusion was very similar, namely that both in adults and children the ADI can be exceeded for high-level consumers. The main contributors to the total anticipated exposure to steviol glycosides are non-alcoholic flavoured drinks (soft drinks).\n(4) While considering the need for new products which are energy-reduced to be placed on the market, the use of steviol glycosides as sweetener should be authorised at appropriate maximum use levels. Taking into account the potential significant contribution of soft drinks to the intake of steviol glycosides, a reduction in the use level for flavoured drinks, compared to the previously proposed use levels considered by the Authority, should be established.\n(5) The Commission will request from producers and users of steviol glycosides information about the actual use of the food additive after its authorisation. The Commission will make such information available to the Member States. When necessary, the Commission will ask the Authority to perform a new refined exposure assessment, taking into account the real uses of steviol glycosides in the different subcategories of foodstuffs and the consumption of normal versus energy-reduced foodstuffs.\n(6) The Authority expressed in its opinion the ADI for steviol glycosides as steviol equivalents. The dietary exposure to the steviol glycosides was also expressed as steviol equivalents. It is therefore appropriate that the maximum permitted use levels should also be expressed as steviol equivalents. Maximum levels of steviol glycosides are expressed as the sum of all named steviol glycosides mentioned in the specifications and can be converted to steviol equivalents using the conversion factors mentioned in the specifications.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional provision\nBy way of derogation to Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(4), the entries in Parts B and E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 concerning steviol glycosides (E 960) shall apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to food on the safety of steviol glycosides for the proposed uses as a food additive.
