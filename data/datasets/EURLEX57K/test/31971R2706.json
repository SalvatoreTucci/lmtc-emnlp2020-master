Transfer the mixture to a 100 ml calibrated round-bottomed flask and fill to the mark with distilled water. Let the mixture stand for thirty minutes ; then filter through a fluted filter.\nWith a pipette, transfer 5 ml of the clarified solution to a test tube. Add 1 ml of a 10 % solution of crystalline guaiacol and 96 % ethanol and 1 ml of 1 % H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). The solutions of the two reagents must be freshly prepared. Check the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution. After half an hour, there should be no change in colour or only an insignificant change to reddish-brown, as compared with a blank test carried out at the same time.\nThe colour test shall be carried out twice."}
