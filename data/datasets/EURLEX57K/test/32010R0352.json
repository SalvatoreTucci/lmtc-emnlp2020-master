Fruit, vegetables and cereals, fresh or processed\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the product to which the name in (1) applies\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is an early potato which is small in size (less than 70 mm).\nPotatoes qualifying for the designation of origin \u2018Pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 must come from the varieties for human consumption Alcmaria, Goulvena, P\u00e9n\u00e9lope, Starlette or Carrera or the varieties for human consumption with firm flesh Amandine, BF15, Charlotte or Roseval.\nThey are known for their firm texture and specific aromas with vegetable overtones. Their dry matter content is between 15 and 19\u00a0% for the Alcmaria, Goulvena, P\u00e9n\u00e9lope, Starlette and Carrera varieties and between 16 and 19,5\u00a0% for the Amandine, BF15, Charlotte and Roseval varieties.\nHarvested before they are completely mature, their skin is fine and comes off easily with simple scrubbing (flaky-skinned tubers).\nThey are seasonal produce and can only be sold up to 31 July inclusive of the year of the harvest and they are not suitable for long-term storage.\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is a fresh vegetable which must be marketed quickly after harvesting.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nNot applicable\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nNot applicable\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe potatoes are produced, sorted, sized and packaged in the region.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is packaged in the region in which it grows for the following reasons:\nPreserving the authenticity of the product:\nPreserving the characteristics of the potato:\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is a product marketed fresh only: it must therefore be packed promptly after harvesting.\nAdditionally the \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is harvested before it is completely mature and for this reason it is a fragile product. It is therefore necessary to avoid any blows which could lead to a change in the skin, e.g. bruises and browning. As a consequence producers take particular care at the stage of harvesting, but also during sorting and packaging, to preserve the characteristics of the potato.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe labels of potatoes using the protected designation of origin \u2018Pomme de terre de l'\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 include in the same visual field the name of the designation and the words \u2018appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2019 or \u2018AOC\u2019 which must feature directly below the name of the designation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe restricted area of production for potatoes qualifying for the protected designation of origin \u2018Pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is located on the \u00eele de R\u00e9 and consists of certain parcels located on the territory of the following municipalities: Canton d\u2019Ars-en-R\u00e9: Ars-en-R\u00e9, La Couarde-sur-Mer, Loix, Les Portes-en-R\u00e9, Saint-Cl\u00e9ment-des-Baleines; Canton de Saint-Martin de R\u00e9: Le Bois-Plage en R\u00e9, La Flotte, Rivedoux-Plage, Sainte-Marie-de-R\u00e9, Saint-Martin de R\u00e9.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nIle de R\u00e9, situated on the Atlantic coast, is a good location from a climatological point of view and is characterised by:\n\u2014 significant amounts of sun and light,\n\u2014 low rainfall between February and May,\n\u2014 exposure to warm and violent winds.\nThese climatic factors typical of a Mediterranean-type climate are favourable for the growth of an early potato as they allow early development (thanks to light, heat and water).\nThe effects of less rainfall than the average for the mainland together with the evapotranspiration are compensated for by the existence of sufficient hydrogeological reserves which allow the crops to be irrigated when the tubers are forming and developing.\nOn Ile de R\u00e9 the land reserved for the production of potatoes is located on coastal soil which is calcolsol with a sandy texture on a limestone base. This is light, dry, filtering soil which heats up quickly and this is beneficial for the early production of potatoes. The producers of \u2018pommes de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 were able to take advantage of these favourable climatological and soil conditions to successfully grow the tuber in accordance with established local practices. The originality of the cultural practices is characterised by:\n\u2014 fertilisation methods: adding organic material in autumn, in particular in the form of kelp (organic compost made of marine algae harvested on the beaches of the island). This organic compost, which is one of the island's veritable treasures, has for a long time been the sole organic compost used. The kelp decomposes more quickly than bovine manure and is said to lead to less disease,\n\u2014 planting in close rows, not very deep, under very shallow layers of soil. The two objectives are to both protect against the wind and to promote growth.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 owes it reputation to its early growth in comparison with the other early potatoes on the mainland.\nIt is characterised by its small size: 70\u00a0% of the quantities harvested are between 30 and 60 mm.\nIt is known for its firm texture and specific aromas with vegetable overtones.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe early growth of the \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 is due both to the nature of the particular climate of the Ile de R\u00e9 and a choice of particularly appropriate soil.\nThe \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 grows earlier than on the mainland without a need of cultivation under glass or shelter as the climate of the island and, in particular, its mild temperatures, allow early crops which will then profit from good quantities of sun and mildness to grow rapidly.\nThe nature of the soil chosen by the producers also helps this early growth. The light and filtering soils heat up very quickly and also evacuate the excess humidity which is harmful to the root development of the potato and to the development of the tuber.\nIn order to benefit from these favourable conditions, the \u2018pommes de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 are planted at shallow depths.\nLight soil also aids the quality of the tubers which, harvested before they are fully mature, are fragile and therefore sensitive to the slightest blows including those received at the time of harvesting. The parcels chosen are therefore sandy and not stony.\nThe crops are densely planted and in close rows under a slight furrow in order to resist the sometimes violent winds on the island.\nThese planting conditions, in particular the density, produce the characteristically small-sized \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019.\nThe organoleptic characteristics of the \u2018pomme de terre de l\u2019\u00eele de R\u00e9\u2019 play a role both in the choice of the varieties and in the early character of this potato which, together with the soil on the island, ensure that this potato remains firm after cooking and emits vegetable and spring aromas.\nReference to the publication of the specification\nhttp://www.inao.gouv.fr/repository/editeur/pdf/CDC-AOP/CDCPommeDeTerreDeLIleDeRe.pdf"}
