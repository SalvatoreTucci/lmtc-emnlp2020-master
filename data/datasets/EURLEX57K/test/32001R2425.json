Therefore, the fishing possibilities for 2001 on this stock need to be revised.\n(2) The Community, on behalf of Sweden, has agreed with Poland that the right to fish for herring allocated to Sweden in Polish waters shall be transferred to Community waters.\n(3) A definitive catch limitation for capelin in the North Atlantic has been fixed and, consequently, the definitive Community catch quota for this stock within the waters of Greenland should be fixed.\n(4) The area of distribution of redfish in the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) area overlaps with certain areas of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Regulatory Area; it is therefore necessary to introduce a mechanism to consider catches in both areas as part of the same stock, as recommended by NEAFC and NAFO at their meetings in March 2001.\n(5) Within the framework of NAFO, new limits on the number of days to fish for northern prawn have been established in March 2001.\n(6) The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) adopted, at its annual meeting in June 2001, catch limitations for yellowfin tuna. Although the Community is not a member of this organisation, it is necessary to implement those catch limitations to ensure sustainable management of this fish resource.\n(7) In the framework of NEAFC, new protected areas were recommended in March 2001 to protect haddock.\n(8) Within the framework of the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC), new technical conservation measures have been recommended in March 2001 for the cod fishery. Those recommendations should be implemented by the Community.\n(9) Agreements have been reached between the European Community, Norway and the Faroe Islands on the arrangement of fishing licences.\n(10) The biological situation of the blue whiting stock does not allow any additional fishing in areas outside national jurisdiction in ICES subarea II. Consequently, a TAC of 0 should be introduced for this year for the areas in ICES subareas I and II that belong to the NEAFC Regulatory area.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 2848/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) In order to ensure the long-term livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to implement fisheries legislation involving TACs and quotas during the year to which they apply. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in paragraph 1(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaties establishing the European Communities,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2848/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the entry in Annex I to this Regulation shall replace the corresponding entry in Annex IB;\n2. the entry in Annex Ia to this Regulation shall replace the corresponding entry in Annex IA;\n3. the entries in Annex II to this Regulation shall replace the corresponding entries in Annex IC;\n4. the entry in Annex IIa to this Regulation shall be inserted in Annex IC;\n5.

There shall be only one window. The window shall not be obstructed in any way by either internal or external attachments.\nSize of the codend, extension piece and the rear end of the trawl\nThe codend shall be constructed of two panels of equal size, joined together by selvedges one on each side.\nThe carrying on board of a net having more than 100 open diamond meshes in any circumference of the codend, excluding the joining or the selvedges shall be prohibited.\nThe number of open diamond meshes, excluding those in the selvedges, at any point on any circumference of any extension or lengthening piece shall not be less or more than the maximum number of meshes on the circumference of the front end of the codend stricto sensu and the rear end of the tapered section of the trawl excluding meshes in the selvedges (Figure 1).\nLocation of the window\nThe window shall be inserted into the top panel of the codend. The window shall terminate not more than 4 meshes from the codline, inclusive of the hand braided row of meshes through which the codline is passed (Figure 2).\nSize of the window\nThe width of the window, expressed in number of mesh bars, shall be equal to the number of open diamond meshes in the top panel divided by two. If necessary, it will be allowed to maintain at the most 20 % of the number of open diamond meshes in the top panel divided evenly on the both sides of the window panel (Figure 3).\nLength of the window shall be at least 3,5 meters.\nThe netting of the window\nThe meshes shall have a minimum mesh opening of 120 millimetres. The meshes shall be square meshes i.e. all four sides of the window netting will be cut all bars. The netting shall be mounted such that the bars run parallel and perpendicular to the length of the codend. The netting shall be knotless braided single twine or a netting with similar proven selective properties (stiffness, strengths and stability). The diameter of the single yarn shall be at least 4,9 millimetres.\nOther specification\nThe mounting specifications are defined in Figures 4a to c. The length of the lifting strap shall not be less than 4 m.\nFigure 1\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001401.TIF\">\nA trawl gear can be divided into three different sections according to their shape and function. Trawl body is always a tapered section often between 10 and 40 m long. Extension piece is untapered section normally manufactured of either one or two pieces of 49,5 mesh long nets giving a stretched length between 6 or 12 m. Codend is also an untapered section often made of double twine in order to have a better resistance against heavy wearing. The length of codend is often 49,5 meshes i.e. ca 6 meter although shorter codends (2 to 4) exists in smaller vessels. The part below lifting strap is called lifting bag.\nFigure 2\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001402.TIF\">\nThe distance of window panel from codline is 4 meshes. There are 3,5 diamond meshes in the upper panel and one 0,5 mesh deep hand-braided \"codline\" row.\nFigure 3\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001501.TIF\">\nTwenty percent of diamond meshes in the upper panel along a perpendicular row running from one selvedge to another may be maintained. For example (like in figure) if the upper panel would be 30 open meshes wide 20 % of that would be 6 meshes. Then three open meshes is divided on both sides of the window panel. Consequently the width of the window panel would then become 12 mesh bars (30 - 6 = 24 diamond meshes divided by two is 12 mesh bars).\nFigure 4a\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001601.TIF\">\nShowing the construction of lower panel made of 49,5 meshes deep netting\nFigure 4b\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001701.TIF\">\nThe construction of upper panel, size and position of the window panel in case where the escape panel runs from selvedge to selvedge\nFigure 4c\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001328EN.001801.TIF\">\nThe construction of upper panel in case 20 % of diamond meshes in the upper panel are maintained and equally divided on both sides of the window\nANNEX VII\nPART I\nQUANTITATIVE LIMITATIONS OF LICENCES AND FISHING PERMITS FOR COMMUNITY VESSELS FISHING IN THIRD COUNTRY WATERS\n>TABLE>\nPART II\nQUANTITATIVE LIMITATIONS OF LICENCES AND FISHING PERMITS FOR THIRD COUNTRIES VESSELS IN COMMUNITY WATERS\n>TABLE>"}
