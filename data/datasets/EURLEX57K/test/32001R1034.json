That decision was taken on 19 January 2001. Therefore, the quota was opened on 24 January 2001.\n(2) In the light of the knowledge of the definitive date of the opening of the quota, the quota amount should be modified pro rata to the length of time during which it will be open, namely 128 days from 24 January 2001 to 31 May 2001. Therefore, the amount of the quota should be modified to 128/365ths of the quantity of the 2730000 tonnes foreseen in Council Regulation (EC) No 1804/98 for a full quota year, which is 957370 tonnes.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 6/2001 is replaced by the following:\n\"ANNEX\n>TABLE>\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 233, 20.8.1998, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 2, 5.1.2001, p. 4."}
