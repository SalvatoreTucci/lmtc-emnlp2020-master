Where no such choice is granted the Member State concerned shall indicate in the draft PAIA the non-capitalized basis upon which the capitalized payments are to be made.\n(b) A capitalized aid may also include one which is partially capitalized where the payments are spread over a number of years provided the pattern of payments over the years in question reflects costs per work unit greater than ECU 1 000 in the first  year. The degressivity of such payments shall comply with Article 6.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
