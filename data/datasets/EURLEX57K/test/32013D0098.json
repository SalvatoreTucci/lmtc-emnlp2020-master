It was therefore necessary for the Commission to recommend to the Member States, by means of Commission Recommendation 2013/99/EU\u00a0(2), a coordinated control plan with a view to establish the prevalence of these fraudulent practices in the marketing of such foods. The coordinated control plan should be carried out for a period of one month starting from the date of the adoption of the Commission Recommendation, or at the latest by 1 March 2013.\n(2) In order to facilitate smooth and fast application of this plan, the Union should financially support the Member States which carry out this plan at the most appropriate level. Taking into account the exceptional character of the situation, the urgent need to reassure consumers, to prevent disruption of trade in the concerned market and ensure that Union exports are not affected, it is duly justified to fix the rate of eligible costs borne by the Union at 75\u00a0%.\n(3) Based on current information the cost for carrying out DNA tests on foods marketed and/or labelled as containing beef and for detecting phenylbutazone (PBZ) residues in horse meat are estimated at EUR 400 per test or detection.\n(4) With a Union co-financing rate of 75\u00a0%, the maximum Union contribution for carrying out DNA and PBZ tests would be EUR 300 per test.\n(5) In accordance with Article 84 of the Financial Regulation and Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union\u00a0(3) (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Rules of Application\u2019), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.\n(6) The measures eligible for Union financial support are defined within the current Commission Implementing Decision.\n(7) The financial contribution from the Union should be granted subject to the condition that the tests and analyses have been carried out and that the competent authorities supply all the necessary information within the time limits laid down in this Decision.\n(8) For reasons of administrative efficiency all expenditure submitted for a financial contribution by the Union should be expressed in euro. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4), the conversion rate for expenditure in a currency other than the euro should be the most recent exchange rate set by the European Central Bank prior to the first day of the month in which the application is submitted by the Member State concerned.\n(9) Under Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, financial contribution to these kind of plans are to be financed under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
