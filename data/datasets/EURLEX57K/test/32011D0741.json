The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission of any such measure, indicating the reason for its decision.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 7(2) of Directive 94/9/EC, the Commission is required, after entering into consultation with the parties concerned, to declare whether it finds such a measure justified or not. If the measure is found justified, the Commission shall inform the Member States so that they can take all appropriate measures with respect to the equipment or protective system concerned, in accordance with their obligations under Article 2(1) of Directive 94/9/EC.\n(4) On 17 March 2011, the authorities of Germany formally notified to the European Commission a prohibition measure concerning the placing on the market and the withdrawal from the market/retailers of a Mobile Phone, mark and type XP-Ex-1, manufactured by Experts Intrinsic Safety Specialists, Groningsewet 7, 2994 LC Barendrecht, Netherlands. According to the documents submitted to the Commission, this product was subject to the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 8(1)(b) of Directive 94/9/EC, attested by the EC-Type Examination Certificate No BKI09ATEX0014 X issued by BKIEx \u2014 ExV\u00c1 Robban\u00e1sbiztos Berendez\u00e9sek Vizg\u00e1l\u00f3 \u00c1llom\u00e1sa Kft., Mikoviny Samuel u. 2-4, 1037 Hungary \u2014 Notified Body No 1418.\n(5) The German authorities indicated that their measure was based on the non-conformity of the product with the essential health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 94/9/EC and set out in Annex II, in particular in points 1.0.5 (Marking) and 1.3 (Potential ignition sources), related to the incorrect application or shortcomings of the harmonised standard EN 60079-11:2007 Explosive atmospheres \u2014 Part 11 \u2014 Equipment protection by intrinsic safety \u2018i\u2019 (IEC 60079-11:2006), which is referred in the EC-Type Examination Certificate issued by BKIEx \u2014 ExV\u00c1:\n\u2014 paragraph 5.3 (energy and power limitation not in accordance)\n\u2014 paragraph 6.3.1.1 (minimum distances not kept: voltage 4,2\u00a0V needs a distance of 1,5\u00a0mm; the existing distance is about 0,2\u00a0mm)\n\u2014 paragraph 10.5.3 (power supply not in accordance)\n\u2014 diagram/table (capacitance of the main circuit board without limiting elements; maximum amount 299 \u03bcF is a multiple of 3\u00a0000 of the permissible limit).\n(6) The German authorities submitted the Order of Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Darmstadt Unit IV/Wiesbaden informing about sales ban concerning Mobile Phone Expert XP-Ex-1, with the related grounds, reports and letters, and a Quality report by KEMA No 211518000/A on Mobile Phone XP-Ex-1, to substantiate their findings.\n(7) According to the German authorities, the Mobile Phone does not meet the essential health and safety requirements of Directive 94/9/EC for electrical equipment of Category 2: it can produce hazardous sparks in case of faults, therefore the requirements of the intrinsic safety protection mode are not fulfilled. The German authorities conclude that this product is not safe for use in Zone 1 environments (Category 2G) and represents a real ignition danger in the case of intended use.\n(8) On 8 April 2011, the Commission wrote to the manufacturer \u2014 Experts Intrinsic Safety Specialists \u2014 and to the Notified Body who issued the EC-Type Examination Certificate \u2014 BKIEx \u2014 ExV\u00c1 Robban\u00e1sbiztos Berendez\u00e9sek Vizg\u00e1l\u00f3 \u00c1llom\u00e1sa Kft. \u2014 inviting them to communicate their observations regarding the measure taken by the German authorities.\n(9) To date, no reply has been received.\n(10) In light of the documentation available, and the comments or the absence of comments of the parties concerned, the Commission considers that the Mobile Phone \u2018Expert XP-Ex-1\u2019 fails to comply with the essential health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive 94/9/EC and set out in Annex II, in particular in points 1.0.5 (Marking) and 1.3 (Potential ignition sources).
