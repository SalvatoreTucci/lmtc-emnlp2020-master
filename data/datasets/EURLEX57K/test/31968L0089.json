COUVE de MURVILLE\nANNEX\n1. MEASUREMENT\n1.1 General      1.1.1 Measurement shall be either by volume (true or stacked cubic metres) or by weight.\n1.1.2 Only the metric system shall be used for measuring.\n1.1.3 Measuring instruments shall be officially inspected and maintained in good condition.\n1.2 Wood in the full length      1.2.1 Wood in the rough whose volume is usually expressed in true cubic metres shall be called wood in the full length.\n1.2.2 Wood in the full length shall usually be measured in individual units. Wood in the full length of irregular shape shall be measured by sections.\n1.2.3 The volume of an individual unit shall be determined from the length and the diameter measured over or under bark. Volume shall be calculated to the nearest two decimal places at least, using customary cube tables.\n1.2.4 Diameter measurements shall be rounded off to the centimetre below. Where diameter is measured over bark, a reasonable reduction shall be made. The reduction made shall be stated.\n1.2.5 In the case of measurements up to and including 19 cm, the diameter under bark shall be measured in one operation using a forestry caliper on the felled trunk (horizontal diameter). In the case of measurements over 20 cm under bark, however, the diameter shall be determined by two intersecting measurements made perpendicularly one to the other (as far as possible, at the narrowest diameter and the widest diameter). If the place to be measured is situated on a whorl of branches or at another irregular part of the trunk, the diameter shall be obtained by taking the average of the measurements made on either side and at an equal distance from the place to be measured.\n1.2.6 Length measurements shall be rounded off to the decimetre below. For wood in the full length with a middle diameter of 20 cm or less under bark, the length may be rounded off to the metre below. If there is a felling bevel, the length shall be measured from the middle of that bevel.\n1.3 Wood in stacked cubic metres      1.3.1 Wood in the rough whose volume is usually expressed in stacked cubic metres shall be called wood in stacked cubic metres.\n1.3.2 Wood in stacked cubic metres shall be over-measured in height by at least 3 %.\n2. CLASSIFICATION\n2.1 General      2.1.1 Wood in the rough may be classified:        (i) by species and common name,\n(ii) by dimensions,\n(iii) by quality.\n2.2 Classification by dimensions      2.2.1 For measuring the diameter and the length for purposes of classification, items 1.2.4, 1.2.5 and 1.2.6 shall apply.\n2.2.2 Dimension classification shall be made, irrespective of length, according to the middle diameter under bark using the following classifications: >PIC FILE= \"T0050827\">\n2.2.3 Further classes may be formed above class 6, maintaining however the same graduation. Subdivision into a and b subclasses may be disregarded or extended to all classes.\n2.2.4 Wood in the full length may also be classified by minimum length and minimum top diameter under bark corresponding to that length using the following classifications: >PIC FILE= \"T0050828\">\nBy way of derogation from the provisions of item 1.2.3, the top diameter shall be measured only once.\n2.2.5 Certain groups made up of different types of wood in the full length (poles, posts etc) shall be divided into classes according to the diameter over bark 1 cm from the butt-end using the following classifications: >PIC FILE= \"T0050829\">\n2.2.6 Wood in stacked cubic metres shall be divided into classes according to the top diameter over bark using the following classifications: >PIC FILE= \"T0050830\">\nWhen wood in stacked cubic metres is stripped of its bark, the diameters given above shall be reduced by 1 cm.\n2.3 Classification by quality      2.3.1 Quality classification shall take into consideration the following criteria:  - Bending: bending shall be measured by dividing the total bow, expressed in centimetres to the nearest centimetre, by the distance separating the two extremities of the bend, expressed in metres to one decimal place.\nBending shall be expressed in centimetres per metre.\n- Twisted grain: the extent of this defect shall be measured by determining the distance, expressed in centimetres to the nearest centimetre per metre length, between the direction of the fibres and a generating line parallel to the axis of the wood in the full length.\nTwist shall be expressed in centimetres per metre.\n- Taper: taper shall be measured by dividing the difference between the diameters of the wood in the full length 1 m from the extremities, measured in centimetres and rounded to the centimetre below, by the distance separating them, expressed in metres to one decimal place.\nTaper shall be expressed in centimetres per metre to one decimal place.\n- Exposed knots, sound (or light) knots, decayed (or black) knots. The diameter of knots shall be measured in millimetres at their smallest dimension.\n- Overgrown knots, knobs.\n- Eccentric heart.\n- Reaction wood: tension wood in the case of broad-leaved trees, compression wood or red striped in the case of conifers.\n- Irregularity of contour.\n- Ring shakes, heart shakes, felling shakes, frost cracks.\n- Wood derived from trees seasoned on the stump and defects due to seasoning, checks.\n- Discoloration.\n- Other defects caused by harmful organisms.\n2.3.2 When classification is by quality, wood in the rough shall be divided into quality classes according to the following classifications: >PIC FILE= \"T0050831\">\n2.3.3 Wood in the full length in quality classes A/EEC and C/EEC must bear an indelible class identification mark. The class identification mark is not necessary for wood in the full length of class B/EEC."}
