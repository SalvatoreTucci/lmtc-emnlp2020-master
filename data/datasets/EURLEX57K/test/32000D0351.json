General Description\nThe host server for the exchange and processing of messages and other data must be operational by 1 April 2001 at the latest.\nIt must comprise the following elements:\n(a) computers of a suitable number and performance to guarantee the management of large amounts of data, the acceptance of veterinary applications, databases and reference files,\n(b) equipment (hard- and software) guaranteeing multiprotocol communications management between the various networks permitting simultaneous access for many users,\n(c) e-message services conforming to international standards,\n(d) web-type facilities and services,\n(e) file transfer services,\n(f) data storage capacity sufficient for one year,\n(g) archiving facilities during the contract period,\n(h) back-up and immediate reboot facilities in the event of a breakdown.\nThe host server must be able to interoperate with existing systems such as national servers or systems in national veterinary administrations conforming to international standards.\nThe host server must be available around the clock seven days a week.\n2. Format and volume of transmitted data\nMessage format for existing applications must be ASCII with defined characters but must be capable of developing toward other structured formats. The estimated number of messages transmitted per day is approximately 4000. As a result management of the host server will involve some 4000 entry and 8000 dispatch operations per day.\nOther data transmitted will be principally reference and data files and application software.\n3. System capacity\nThe system must be able to manage 2000 potential users. However, since periods of use may vary, the estimated number of simultaneous users (input and output) will be an average of about 70 and a maximum of 100. That capacity must be expandable if necessary to guarantee the level of service. The system must be capable of managing waiting queues.\n4. Message traceability\nThe host server must be able to guarantee and monitor the traceability of messages. It must ensure that operation of communication networks is maintained and that interrupted communications are restored, and that it possesses all the message traceability elements it may be required to have at any time.\n5. System and data security\nThe host server must have a set of strict and coherent provisions for data protection and integrity. Data shall not be useable by the host server.\nAccess to the system must be protected and controlled by a series of security procedures using various methods such as user IDs and message transmitter authentication by the host server.\nA series of measures to back up and restore data in the system must be available and operational at the host server such that no information can be lost because of hardware failure.\nThe host server must have all the skilled staff necessary.\n6. Assistance\nA help service must be available 12 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at the host server premises to deal with any communication problems.\nEach application shall have on-line support.\n7. System management\nThe host server must provide management statistics, concerning message flow, reference file dissemination, communication network breakdowns and all parameters of use for cost management purposes."}
