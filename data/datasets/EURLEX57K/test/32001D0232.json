This objective may be attained by appropriate preventive measures, particularly in regard to hygiene, at the different stages of product processing, and by educating and informing the final consumer in a suitably unambiguous manner.\n(5) Furthermore, a labelling measure in the form of a warning and recommendations to consumers may also help towards attaining the desired objective in so far as it offers guarantees of reliability and can be implemented in a way which can be easily understood by consumers.\n(6) However, the draft regulation submitted by the Netherlands does not meet the abovementioned conditions, as implementation thereof raises questions and could give rise to confusion or misunderstanding on the part of consumers. In particular, since packaging and labelling are only compulsory for contaminated poultry meat, only an exhaustive inspection prior to marketing would ensure the reliability of the measure. In reality, as no specific inspection system is planned, it is possible that a proportion of the contaminated products will not be detected, and therefore not labelled, and that products which are not contaminated at the production stage may be contaminated at the distribution stage, yet will not be labelled.\n(7) There is therefore a significant risk that consumers choosing an unlabelled product, thinking it to be free of contamination, may in fact be in possession of a contaminated product but believe that they need take no precautions.\n(8) Furthermore, the wording envisaged for the warning is complex and liable to be misunderstood by some consumers, particularly with regard to the fact that contaminated products are offered for sale.\n(9) The abovementioned difficulties could be avoided, and the objective attained more readily, if the Netherlands authorities applied the draft regulation notified to all poultrymeat marketed in the Netherlands and clarified it by simplifying the warning label, which should refer to the possibility of contamination rather than affirm that the product is contaminated.\n(10) In the light of the foregoing, the Commission's opinion is negative, in accordance with Article 19, third paragraph, of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(11) The Netherlands authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft regulation in question.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["The Netherlands must not adopt their draft regulation stipulating the prepacking and labelling of poultrymeat in the event of contaminaton by Salmonella or Campylobacter, unless the following amendments are introduced:\n1. application, save in duly substantiated exceptional cases, to all poultrymeat marketed in the Netherlands;\n2. clarification and simplification of the warning on the label, stating that there is a possibility of contamination.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 March 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29."}
