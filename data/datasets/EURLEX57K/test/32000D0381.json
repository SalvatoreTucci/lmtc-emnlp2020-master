The validity of the measures adopted under Decision 1999/815/EC on the basis of Article 9 of Directive 92/59/EEC was prolonged under Commission Decision 2000/217/EC for an additional period of three months, in accordance with the provision of Article 11(2) of the said Directive. Therefore the validity of the Decision was to expire on 6 June 2000.\n(5) The reasons which motivated Decision 1999/815/EC and its first prolongation under Decision 2000/217/EC(3) are still valid and it is therefore necessary to maintain the prohibition of the placing on the market of the products considered.\n(6) Certain Member States have implemented Decision 1999/815/EC as modified by Decision 2000/217/EC by measures applicable until 6 June 2000. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that the validity of these measures is prolonged.\n(7) It is therefore necessary to prolong the validity of Decision 1999/815/EC for a second time in order to ensure that all the Member States maintain the prohibition provided for by that Decision. According to Article 11(2) of Directive 92/59/EEC the validity may be prolonged for a period of three months.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Emergencies Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 5 of Decision 1999/815/EC the words \"6 June 2000\" are replaced by the words \"three months after the date of notification(4)\".", "Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Decision within less than 10 days of its notification.
