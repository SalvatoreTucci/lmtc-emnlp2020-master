Approximately 2624 tonnes of unprocessed dried figs no longer fit for human consumption held by the Greek and Spanish storage agencies must be sold for specific uses within the meaning of Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 626/85 of 12 March 1985 on the purchasing, selling and storage of unprocessed dried grapes and figs by storage agencies(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1437/97(4);\n(2) there are currently outlets for unprocessed dried figs unfit for human consumption in the distillation and animal feed sectors and the products held by the storage agencies should be sold for these two uses. In view of the small amounts for sale and the special characteristics of the markets for which they are intended, sale at a price fixed in advance is most appropriate;\n(3) the appropriate selling price is the same for both intended uses, given that the terms of access to the two markets are similar, and the special security referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 should be fixed on the basis of the difference between the normal market price for dried figs and the selling price fixed by this Regulation;\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1707/85 of 21 June 1985 on the sale of unprocessed dried figs by storage agencies for the manufacture of alcohol(5) lays down the detailed rules for the sale of unprocessed dried figs to distilleries. In the case of dried figs intended for a animal feed, to facilitate checks that they are used for the intended purpose, it is necessary to stipulate the end product to be made and the deadline for its manufacture and to require a commitment on the part of the manufacturer to use the products in question in the manufacture of animal feed;\n(5) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1.
