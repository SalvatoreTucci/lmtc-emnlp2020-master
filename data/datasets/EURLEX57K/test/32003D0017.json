The rules also provide for seed sampling and testing in accordance with the methods of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA), or where appropriate, in accordance with the rules of the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA).\n(3) An examination of those rules and the manner in which they are applied in the aforementioned third countries has shown that the field inspection of seed-producing crops satisfies the conditions laid down in Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in those countries afford the same assurances as regards the seed's characteristics and the arrangements for its examination, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the Community, provided that further conditions for seed-producing crops and seed produced, in particular in respect of packages marking, are satisfied.\n(4) Council Decision 95/514/EC of 29 November 1995 on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries(5) provides that for a limited period field inspections carried out in certain third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species are considered as equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Community legislation and that seed of certain species produced in those countries is considered as equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Community legislation.\n(5) As Decision 95/514/EC will expire on 31 December 2002, a new decision should be adopted and its scope extended in particular by including Estonia, Latvia and Yugoslavia.\n(6) It appears desirable to limit the period for which equivalence is recognised under this Decision to five years.\n(7) It is appropriate to include in this Decision specific rules concerning relabelling and refastening in the Community incorporating rules similar to those provided by Decision 86/110/EEC(6), which is no longer applicable.\n(8) The existing legislation already provides for an obligation for seed, including not finally certified seed, marketed in the Community to indicate whether the seed is chemically treated or the variety has been genetically modified. It is appropriate to provide for detailed rules on the exact indications to be given on the label of certified seed imported under this Decision. It is appropriate for these rules to mirror the ones provided by Decision 95/514/EC. It will be appropriate in future to update the annexes of the present Decision in order to ensure that imported seed is subject to requirements equivalent to any new rules which may be introduced, especially for not finally certified seed.\n(9) Certain amendments to the Annexes to this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),", "main_body": ["Field inspections concerning the seed-producing crops of the species specified in Annex I carried out in the third countries listed in that Annex, excluding seed of generations prior to basic seed, shall be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC provided that they:\n(a) are carried out officially by the authorities listed in Annex I, or under the official supervision of those authorities;\n(b) satisfy the conditions laid down in point A of Annex II.", "Seed of the species specified in Annex I, produced in the third countries listed in that Annex and officially certified by the authorities listed in that Annex, excluding seed of generations prior to basic seed, shall be considered equivalent to seed complying with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC, if it satisfies the conditions laid down in point B of Annex II.", "1.

Seed shall satisfy the following additional conditions in respect of package marking.\n3.1. The following official information shall be given:\n- a statement that the seed satisfies the conditions of Community rules other than those relating to varietal identity and varietal purity: \"EC rules and standards\",\n- a statement that the seed has been sampled and tested in accordance with current international methods: \"Sampled and analysed according to ISTA rules for orange or green certificates by ..., (name or initials of the ISTA seed testing station)\",\n- date of official closing,\n- where seed lots have been \"relabelled and refastened\" within the meaning of the OECD schemes, also a statement that this operation took place, the most recent date of reclosing and the Authorities responsible therefore,\n- country of production,\n- declared net or gross weight or declared number of pure seeds or, in the case of beet seed, clusters, and\n- where weight is indicated and granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives are used, the nature of the additive and also the approximate ratio between the weight of pure seed and the total weight.\nThis information may be given either on the OECD label or on an additional official label which shall give the name of the service and the country. Any suppliers' labels shall be drawn up in such a manner that they cannot be confused with the additional official label.\n3.2. In the case of seed of a variety which has been genetically modified, any label or document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to, or accompanies, the seed lot shall clearly indicate that the variety has been genetically modified and provide for any other information as may be determined in the authorisation procedure required under Community law.\n3.3. An official notice placed inside the package shall give at least the reference number of the lot, the species and the variety; in addition, in the case of beet seed, it shall be stated, where appropriate, whether the seed is monogerm or precision seed.\nThis notice is not necessary if the minimum information is printed indelibly on the package or if an adhesive label or a label of non-tear material is used.\n3.4.
