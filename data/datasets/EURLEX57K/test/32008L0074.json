Consequently, it is also necessary to amend Commission Directive 2005/78/EC\u00a0(3), which implements that Directive.\n(2) As a consequence of the change of scope, it is necessary to introduce new requirements into the heavy-duty emissions legislation set up by Directive 2005/55/EC. These requirements include test procedures to enable type approval of heavy-duty engines and vehicles with petrol engines.\n(3) In addition, it is necessary to introduce existing requirements for measuring the smoke opacity of diesel engines into Directive 2005/78/EC. This is due to the repeal of Council Directive 72/306/EEC of 2 August 1972 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of pollutants from diesel engines for use in vehicles\u00a0(4) as provided by Regulation (EC) No 715/2007.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Directive 2005/55/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
