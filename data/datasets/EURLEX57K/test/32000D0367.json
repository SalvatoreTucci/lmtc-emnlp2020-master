Those documents have been published as the Communication of the Commission with regard to the interpretative documents of Council Directive 89/106/EEC(3).\n(2) Paragraph 4.2.1 of interpretative document No 2 justifies the need for different levels of the essential requirement \"Safety in case of fire\" as a function of the type, use and location of the construction work, its layout and the availability of the emergency facilities.\n(3) Paragraph 2.2 of interpretative document No 2 lists a number of interrelated measures for the satisfaction of the essential requirement \"Safety in case of fire\" that together contribute to define the fire safety strategy that can be developed in different ways in Member States.\n(4) Paragraph 4.3.1.3 of interpretative document No 2 identifies one of these measures prevailing in Member States that relates to the resistance to fire performance of construction products and/or parts of construction works.\n(5) To enable the resistance to fire performance of construction products and construction works or parts thereof to be evaluated, the harmonised solution consists in a system of classes that is included in interpretative document No 2.\n(6) This system of classes has been adapted to technical progress in a mandate from the Commission to the European standardisation bodies, CEN and Cenelec.\n(7) Article 6(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC states that the Member States may determine the performance levels to be observed in their territory only within the classifications adopted at Community level and only subject to the use of all or some classes or one class.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The classification system adopted at Community level for the resistance to fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30.8.1993, p. 1.\n(3) OJ C 62, 28.2.1994, p. 1.\nANNEX\nDEFINITIONS, TESTS AND PERFORMANCE CRITERIA\nThe relevant definitions, tests and performance criteria are fully described in, or referenced from, the European standards referred to in this Annex.\nSYMBOLS\n>TABLE>\nNotes\n1.
