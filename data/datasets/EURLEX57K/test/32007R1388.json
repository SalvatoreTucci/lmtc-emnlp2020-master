This change should also open up the way for new commercial applications and facilitate the development of more efficient and environmentally-sound manufacturing methods. At the same time it should be made clear that the approval of processing undertakings remains subject to the condition that they are capable of producing dried fodder in accordance with the terms of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003.\n(3) For the same reason, the obligations concerning the manufacture of fodder laid down in Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2005\u00a0(3) are also no longer necessary; this should lead to a reduction in administrative and control costs.\n(4) To make on-the-spot checks on processing undertakings more efficient, it should be made clear that certain information must be made available to the competent authorities and that the control reports must make it possible to review the documents examined.\n(5) An additional parameter should be added in order to round out the information relating to the record of energy used in the production of dehydrated fodder.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) Given that the 2007/08 marketing year is already in progress, and in order to prevent operators in the sector from being treated differently depending on the time at which they submit their applications, this Regulation should not apply until the 2008/09 marketing year.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
