That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the preparation Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC Sc 47 (Biosaf Sc 47) as a feed additive for pigs for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC Sc 47 was authorised for dairy cows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1811/2005\u00a0(2), for cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 316/2003\u00a0(3), for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2148/2004\u00a0(4), for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004\u00a0(5), for rabbits for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 600/2005\u00a0(6), for horses by Commission Regulation (EC) No 186/2007\u00a0(7) and for dairy goats and dairy sheep by Commission Regulation (EC) No 188/2007\u00a0(8), for lambs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1447/2006\u00a0(9).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for pigs for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concludes in its opinion of 22 November 2007 that the safety of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Biosaf Sc 47) for the consumer, the user and the environment has already been established by its previous opinions\u00a0(10). It further concludes that the use of the preparation does not present a risk for this additional animal category and that the use of that preparation can improve performance parameters in pigs for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
