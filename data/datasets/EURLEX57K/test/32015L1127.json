This includes incineration facilities dedicated to the processing of municipal solid waste only where their energy efficiency meet the threshold established by using the energy efficiency formula (R1 formula) referred to in Annex II to Directive 2008/98/EC.\n(3) It results from technical evidence that local climate conditions in the Union influence the amounts of energy that can technically be used or produced in the form of electricity, heating, cooling or processing steam by incineration facilities dedicated to the processing of municipal solid waste.\n(4) A report from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has shown that in order to achieve a level playing field in the Union it is reasonable to compensate incineration facilities affected by the impact of local climatic conditions with a climate correction factor (CCF) applicable to the R1 formula. Such factor should be based on the reference document on Best Available Techniques for waste incineration.\n(5) As a result of the application of a CCF some disposal incineration installations would meet the R1 formula threshold and thus automatically become recovery incineration facilities. Notwithstanding that, the application of such a correction factor should remain an incentive for incineration plants to achieve high efficiency of energy production from waste in line with the objectives and the waste hierarchy laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC.\n(6) The CCF applicable to the R1 formula should be based on climatic conditions for the incineration facility location.\n(7) Directive 2008/98/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 2008/98/EC is amended as set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 July 2016, at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 July 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3.\nANNEX\nIn Annex II to Directive 2008/98/EC, the following text is added under footnote (*):\n\u2018The energy efficiency formula value will be multiplied by a climate correction factor (CCF) as shown below:\n1. CCF for installations in operation and permitted in accordance with applicable Union legislation before 1\u00a0September 2015.\n2. CCF for installations permitted after 31 August 2015 and for installations under 1 after 31 December 2029:\n(The resulting value of CCF will be rounded at three decimal places).\nThe value of HDD (Heating Degree Days) should be taken as the average of annual HDD values for the incineration facility location, calculated for a period of 20 consecutive years before the year for which CCF is calculated. For the calculation of the value of HDD the following method established by Eurostat should be applied: HDD is equal to (18\u00a0\u00b0C \u2014 Tm) \u00d7 d if Tm is lower than or equal to 15\u00a0\u00b0C (heating threshold) and is nil if Tm is greater than 15\u00a0\u00b0C; where Tm is the mean (Tmin\u00a0+\u00a0Tmax/2) outdoor temperature over a period of d days. Calculations are to be executed on a daily basis (d\u00a0= 1), added up to a year.\u2019"}
