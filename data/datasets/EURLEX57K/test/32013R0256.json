In order to achieve this, ingredients such as vitamin D preparations are subjected to a heat treatment. Such treatment in turn requires the presence of an antioxidant which is water-soluble and of neutral pH. Sodium ascorbate (E 301) was identified and proved to be the suitable antioxidant to meet that technological need.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(7) The European Food Safety Authority evaluated the use of Sodium ascorbate (E 301) as a food additive in vitamin D preparations intended for foods for infants and young children and expressed its opinion on 8 December 2010\u00a0(4). It concluded that the proposed extension of use of the food additive Sodium ascorbate (E 301) to be used as an antioxidant for the vitamin D preparations for use in infant formulae and follow-on formulae is not of safety concern.\n(8) It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of Sodium ascorbate (E 301) as an antioxidant in vitamin D preparations intended for use in foods for infants and young children.\n(9) For that reason, Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 401, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS); Scientific Opinion on the use of sodium ascorbate as a food additive in vitamin D preparations intended to be used in formulae and weaning food for infants and young children.
