Citizens should, nevertheless, continue to have the possibility to obtain a printed version of the Official Journal from the Publications Office.\n(7) The Commission Communication entitled \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019 highlights that access to online legal content favours the development of a digital internal market, which leads to economic and social benefits.\n(8) Rules ensuring the authenticity, integrity and inalterability of the electronic publication of the Official Journal should therefore be laid down.\n(9) This Regulation should also lay down rules applicable in cases where, due to unforeseen and exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to publish and to make available the electronic edition of the Official Journal.\n(10) Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures\u00a0(4) establishes the legal effects of electronic signatures as a means for authentication. For the purposes of ensuring the authenticity, integrity and inalterability of the electronic edition of the Official Journal, an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate and created by a secure-signature-creation device in accordance with that Directive provides sufficient guarantees to the public. It should be possible to verify the electronically signed Official Journal by readily available means.\n(11) Access to the EUR-Lex website is to be ensured in compliance with the commitments for the protection of persons with disabilities in accordance with Council Decision 2010/48/EC of 26 November 2009 concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\u00a0(5).\n(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective of enabling all European citizens to rely on the electronic publication of the Official Journal, as its scope is limited to making such publication authentic, in the same way as the printed publication is today.\n(13) The TFEU does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers other than those under Article 352,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Official Journal shall be published in electronic form, in accordance with this Regulation, in the official languages of the institutions of the European Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Article 3, only the Official Journal published in electronic form (hereinafter \u2018the electronic edition of the Official Journal\u2019) shall be authentic and shall produce legal effects.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The electronic edition of the Official Journal shall bear an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate and created with a secure-signature-creation device, in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC.
