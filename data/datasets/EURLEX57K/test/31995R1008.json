Where it appears, from the forecast of expenditure arising from Article 2 of Regulation (EC)  No 165/94 and the decisions on applications for co-financing referred to in paragraph 1 of this  Article, that the total appropriations available will not be used, the Commission may reallocate  the remaining appropriations between those applicant Member States financing more than 50  % of the  work approved by the Commission from their own resources. If the total credits requested exceeds  the appropriations still available after the initial allocation, reallocation shall be based on a  coefficient to be applied to the eligible requests of the Member States exceeding the ceiling  resulting from the application of the distribution scale. The coefficient shall be obtained by  dividing by the total amount remaining available the sum of the Member States' forecasts that  exceed not only 50  % of the predicted cost of the work but also the ceiling for each Member State.  The coefficient obtained shall be applied, for each Member State, to the excess amount calculated  as above.` 2.  Article 5 (4) is replaced by the following:\n'4.
