That Directive covers regenerated cellulose films uncoated or coated with coatings manufactured only with substances listed therein.\n(2) Further to technological developments, it is necessary to authorise a new type of regenerated cellulose film with a coating consisting of plastics, which is compostable and biodegradable. This new type of regenerated cellulose film is consistent with the environmental requirements of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003. Accordingly, such authorisation is in the interest of consistency of Community legislation.\n(3) The rules to be applied to the regenerated cellulose films should be specific to the nature of the layer in contact with the foodstuff. Accordingly, the requirements for regenerated cellulose films coated with coatings consisting of plastics should be different from those provided for regenerated cellulose films uncoated or coated with coatings derived from cellulose.\n(4) Only authorised substances should be used in the manufacture of all the types of regenerated cellulose films, including regenerated cellulose films coated with plastics.\n(5) In the case of regenerated cellulose films coated with coatings consisting of plastics, the layer in contact with foodstuffs consists of a material similar to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. Therefore it is appropriate that the rules provided for in Commission Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(6) should be applicable also to such films.\n(6) In the interest of consistency of Community legislation, the verification of compliance of plastic-coated regenerated cellulose films with the migration limits set by Directive 2002/72/EC should be carried out according to the rules laid down in Council Directive 82/711/EEC of 18 October 1982 laying down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of the constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(7), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/48/EC(8), and Council Directive 85/572/EEC of 19 December 1985 laying down the list of simulants to be used for testing migration of constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(9).\n(7) A number of polymers used as coatings should be deleted from the list of authorised substances set out in Directive 93/10/EEC as they are covered by the rules set out in Directive 2002/72/EC which apply to plastic-coated regenerated cellulose films.\n(8) Four solvents should also be deleted from the list of authorised substances set out in Directive 93/10/EEC as new data are available showing a risk for reproduction and because they are no longer used in the manufacture of regenerated cellulose films. In addition, some plasticisers, which are no longer used, should also be deleted from that list.\n(9) In addition, the restriction on the use of 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (synonym: phosphoric acid diphenyl 2-ethylhexyl ester) set out in Directive 93/10/EEC should be amended to take into account the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food of 19 March 1998.\n(10) Directive 93/10/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 93/10/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
