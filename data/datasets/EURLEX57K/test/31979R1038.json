FRAN\u0e23\u0087OIS-PONCET\nANNEX NAD PROJECT\nSituation\nSouth-eastern and eastern part of the continental shelf of Greenland between 59\u0e22\u0e1a N and 78\u0e22\u0e1a N.\nProject description\n- Detailed studies of existing aeromagnetic lines on the continental shelf to the south-east and east of Greenland and necessary exploration feasibility studies (especially of ice conditions in this area).\n- Geophysical work, including seismic surveys.\n- Detailed geophysical work in order to determine possible drilling targets.\nImportance of the project\nInitial aeromagnetic prospecting of a general nature shows the probable existence of a very extensive sedimentary basin with a sediment thickness of up to 10 000 m. If the geological data obtained on shore are extrapolated, there is a case for thinking that these marine sediments are likely to contain excellent oil-bearing structures. Information from the aeromagnetic surveys and from marine geophysical work already done by scientific institutes will be used to define the sedimentary basins as closely as possible and thus to provide the best possible basis for planning the marine geophysical line layout for the project. Because of ice conditions, marine work will be almost entirely restricted to the area south of 72\u0e22\u0e1a N.\nProposed support\n>PIC FILE= \"T0015895\">  The Danish Government is granting support amounting to 25 % of this cost.\nExecution\nThe work described above will be carried out under the auspices of the Geological Survey of Greenland, which will be responsible for the planning and execution of the entire project. The acquisition of data in the field will be entrusted to companies, following an invitation to tender published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nContract\nThe support contract will not be concluded until the licences and rights required for carrying out the project have been granted by the Danish authorities.\nRepayment\nAll data will be made available on payment of a sum covering reproduction costs. If the results of the abovementioned work are not exploited commercially by the Geological Survey of Greenland, there will be no repayment of the subsidies."}
