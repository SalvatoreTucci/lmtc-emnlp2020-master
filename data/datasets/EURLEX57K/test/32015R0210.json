In the absence of a category of spirit drink corresponding to \u2018Pachar\u00e1n\u2019 and in order to convey clear information to non-Spanish consumers and to reflect economic and market developments, a new category named \u2018Sloe-aromatised spirit drink or Pachar\u00e1n\u2019 should be included in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008. In order to ensure the protection of consumers and of the economic interests of producers, the new category should include technical specifications based on evaluation of existing quality and production parameters used in the Union market.\n(2) Given the reputation of \u2018Pachar\u00e1n\u2019, which the consumers link spontaneously to Spain as recognised in the past, the term \u2018Pachar\u00e1n\u2019 may be used as a sales denomination only when the product is manufactured in Spain. When the product is manufactured outside Spain, the term \u2018Pachar\u00e1n\u2019 may only be used to supplement the sales denomination \u2018Sloe-aromatised spirit drink\u2019 and jointly with the indication of the country of the manufacture.\n(3) The geographical indication \u2018Pachar\u00e1n navarro\u2019, which is registered in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 under \u2018Other spirit drinks\u2019, should be transferred under the category \u2018Sloe-aromatised spirit drink or Pachar\u00e1n\u2019 in the same Annex.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Spirit Drinks,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 are amended as follows:\n(1) in Annex II, after point 37 Sloe gin, the following point 37a is inserted:\n\u201837a \u201cSloe-aromatised spirit drink or Pachar\u00e1n\u201d\n(a) which has a predominant sloe taste and is obtained by the maceration of sloes (Prunus spinosa) in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, with the addition of natural extracts of anise and/or distillates of anise;\n(b) which has a minimum alcoholic strength by volume of 25 %;\n(c) for the production of which a minimum quantity of 125 grams of sloe fruits per litre of final product has been used;\n(d) which has sugar content, expressed as invert sugar between 80 and 250 grams per litre of the final product;\n(e) the organoleptic characteristics, colour and taste of which are provided exclusively by the fruit used and the anise.\n(2) Annex III is amended as follows:\n(a) in the product category \u2018Other spirit drinks\u2019, the following entries are deleted:\n\u2018Pachar\u00e1n navarro Spain\nPachar\u00e1n Spain\u2019\n(b) after the product category 34, the following entry is inserted:\n\u201837a.
