The compensatory aid to be granted in respect of 2005 should be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Under the second subparagraph of Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, supplementary aid is granted in one or more producer regions where the average income from production is significantly lower than the average for the Community.\n(5) The annual average production income from the marketing of bananas produced in Martinique, Guadeloupe and Greece has proved to be significantly lower than the Community average during 2005. As a result, supplementary aid should be granted in the producer regions of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Greece. In view of the data for 2005, which point to very difficult production and marketing conditions, supplementary aid covering 75\u00a0% of the difference between the average income in the Community and the average income recorded on selling products in these regions should be fixed.\n(6) The unit amount of the advances and the amount of the relevant security are established, in accordance with Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, on the basis of the aid fixed for the preceding year.\n(7) Given that not all the necessary data were available, it has not hitherto been possible to determine the compensatory aid for 2005. Provision should be made for the balance of the aid for 2005 and of the advances for bananas marketed during January and February 2006 to be paid within two months of the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The compensatory aid provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 for fresh bananas falling within CN code ex\u00a00803, excluding plantain bananas, produced and marketed in the Community in 2005 shall be EUR\u00a05,90 per 100 kilograms.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aid fixed in paragraph 1 shall be increased by EUR\u00a011,27 per 100 kilograms for bananas produced in Martinique, by EUR\u00a012,12 per 100 kilograms for bananas produced in Guadeloupe and by EUR\u00a07,76 per 100 kilograms for bananas produced in Greece.", "The advance for bananas marketed from January to December 2006 shall amount to EUR\u00a04,13 per 100 kilograms.
