When those prices are fixed, account is to be taken of the regional variations in the price of sugar, which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, may be expected to occur under natural conditions of price formation on the market and in view of experience gained and the costs of transporting sugar from surplus areas to deficit areas.\n(3) To establish whether an area is a deficit area, projections should be made based on the data returned by the Member States relating both to the current marketing year as regards consumption trends, and to the prospects for the coming marketing year as regards developments in available production. As a result, areas should be recognised as deficit areas only where the projections clearly indicate that a deficit is likely to occur.\n(4) On this basis, the areas of production in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Finland are likely to be deficit areas.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The derived intervention prices for white sugar in the deficit areas of the Community shall be:\n(a) EUR 64,65/100 kg for all areas in Ireland and the United Kingdom;\n(b) EUR 64,65/100 kg for all areas in Portugal;\n(c) EUR 64,65/100 kg for all areas in Finland;\n(d) EUR 64,88/100 kg for all areas in Spain.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2002.\nIt shall apply for the 2002/03 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26."}
