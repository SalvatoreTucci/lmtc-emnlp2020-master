Such provisional authorisation may be given for a period up to four years in the case of additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to that Directive.\n(2) New data were submitted by the producing company to extend the authorisation of an enzyme preparation described in the Annex to this Regulation and which is listed under No 24 in the Annexes to Directive 70/524/EEC to a new animal category.
