Community demand for the products to which that Regulation applies should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose, with effect from 1 July 2008 new Community tariff quotas should be opened at zero rates of duty for appropriate amounts and any disturbance of the markets for those products should be avoided.\n(2) The quota amounts for five autonomous Community tariff quotas are insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry. Consequently, those quota amounts should be increased.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point 1.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(5) Since the tariff quotas have to take effect from 1 July 2008, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the tariff quotas for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation shall be inserted;\n2. the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2975, 09.2603, 09.2935, 09.2814 and 09.2620 shall be replaced by the rows in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 16 June 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
