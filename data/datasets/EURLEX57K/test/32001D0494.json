The only changes are related to territorial coverage and the appropriate references to national laws.\n(7) The withdrawal of fish shall be carried out with the aim to eradicate the disease from infected farms and to prevent further spread of the disease to other farms as well as to the wild population susceptible to this infection.\n(8) The withdrawal of fish must be based on a case by case analysis of the risks for further spread of the disease, including the seriousness of the outbreak and other circumstances influencing the risks, and must take into account current practical experience and scientific evidence.\n(9) The examination carried out shows that the scheme submitted fulfils the requirements for such a scheme and therefore it shall be approved.\n(10) For the sake of clarity, bearing in mind any future amendments to the United Kingdom schemes, it is appropriate to incorporate the Decision approving the Scottish scheme in the present Decision. Therefore Decision 2001/186/EC shall be repealed.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The schemes submitted by the United Kingdom for the withdrawal of all fish in farms infected with infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) and situated in England, Scotland and Wales are hereby approved.", "Decision 2001/186/EC is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 175, 19.7.1993, p. 23; Directive as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.\n(2) OJ L 99, 10.4.2001, p. 11.\n(3) OJ L 67, 9.3.2001, p. 80."}
