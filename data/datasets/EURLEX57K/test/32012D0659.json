The derogation was extended by Commission Decision 2005/294/EC\u00a0(3) in connection with the Danish action programme 2004-2007 and by Commission Decision 2008/664/EC\u00a0(4) in connection with the Danish action programme 2008-2012.\n(3) The derogation granted by Decision 2008/664/EC concerned approximately (for the year 2009/2010) 1\u00a0507 cattle holdings, 299\u00a0901 livestock units and 134\u00a0698 hectare of arable land, corresponding respectively to 3,3\u00a0%, 12,5\u00a0% and 6,1\u00a0% of the total in Denmark.\n(4) On 20 June 2012, Denmark submitted to the Commission a request for renewal of the derogation under the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC.\n(5) Denmark has established an action programme for the period 2012-2015, in conformity with Article 5 of Directive 91/676/EEC, by means of Order on commercial livestock, livestock manure, silage, etc. (the livestock manure notice) No 764 of 28 June 2012, Consolidated Act on farms\u2019 use of fertiliser and on plant cover No 415 of 3 May 2011 and Order on farms\u2019 use of fertiliser and on plant cover No 845 of 12 July 2011, which applies to the whole Danish territory.\n(6) Monitoring data show that for groundwater, 82\u00a0% of monitoring sites have mean nitrate concentrations below 50\u00a0mg/l, and 67\u00a0% below 25\u00a0mg/l. For water courses, 99\u00a0% of monitoring sites have mean nitrate concentrations below 50\u00a0mg/l and 76\u00a0% of monitoring sites below 25\u00a0mg/l.\n(7) The Commission, after examination of Denmark\u2019s request and in the light of the experience gained from the derogation as provided in Decisions 2002/915/EC, 2005/294/EC and 2008/664/EC considers that the amount of manure envisaged by Denmark, 230\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(8) Decision 2008/664/EC expired on 31 July 2012.
