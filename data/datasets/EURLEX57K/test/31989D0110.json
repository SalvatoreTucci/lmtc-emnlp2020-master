In 1986 the Commission was informed that the Swedish exporter concerned in the proceeding was no longer involved in production of this material. In January 1988 the Commission gave notice (3) of the impending expiry of these undertakings pursuant to Article 15 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 (4), which has subsequently been replaced by Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.\nThe undertaking given by the Swedish exporter duly expired on 22 June 1988 (5).\n(2)\nReview requests and initiation\nThe Commission received in July 1987 a request for review lodged by the Comit\u0102\u0160 de Liaison des Industries de Ferro-Alliages de la CEE, which represents the whole of Community output of the product concerned.\nThe request alleged significant dumping and price undercutting by certain exporters, so that the existing undertakings were proving increasingly inadequate.\nSubsequent to the publication by the Commission in January 1988 of the notice of impending expiry of the measures at present in force, the Commission received a further request for review from the abovementioned complainant.\nThis request alleged that there had been further gains of EC market share by exporters, obtained by substantial price undercutting, and that the ending of anti-dumping measures would lead to increased injury. The evidence presented of dumping and injury was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a review, announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6), and the Commission commenced an investigation, obtaining from the parties involved all information necessary for the\nassessment of dumping and injury. Pursuant to Article 15 of the above Regulation, the undertakings given by the South African, Turkish and Zimbabwean exporters remained in force pending the outcome of this investigation.\n(3)\nProduct\nThe product concerned is low carbon ferro-chromium with a maximum carbon content of 0,5 % and a maximum silicon content of 1,5 %. It falls within CN codes 7202 49 10 and 7202 49 50.\n(4)\nResults of the dumping investigation\nThe investigation carried out by the Commission's services showed that no dumping on the part of exporters could be established for the reference period, which covered the calendar year 1987.\n(5)\nWithdrawal of review requests\nThe complainant advised the Commission by letter dated 29 September 1988 that it was withdrawing the requests for review mentioned under 2.\n(6)\nTermination\nIn these circumstances the Commission considers that this review proceeding should be terminated and that the undertakings remaining in force pending the outcome of the review should lapse forthwith.", "main_body": ["The review of anti-dumping measures concerning imports of low carbon ferro-chromium originating in South Africa, Turkey and Zimbabwe is hereby terminated.", "The undertakings given by the South African, Turkish and Zimbabwean exporters, which remained in force pending the outcome of the review, shall lapse with effect from the day following the publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 1989.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 161, 21. 6. 1983, p. 15.\n(3) OJ No C 1, 5. 1. 1988, p. 3.\n(4) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No C 307, 2. 12. 1988, p. 2.\n(6) OJ No C 57, 1. 3. 1988, p. 3."}
