Within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector, a specific programme of actions in the nuclear sector, relating to the safe transport of radioactive materials and to safeguards and industrial cooperation to promote certain aspects of the safety of nuclear installations in countries participating in the TACIS programme, hereinafter referred to as 'SURE`, shall be implemented by the Community for the period 1998 to 2002.\n2. In addition to the priority objectives listed in Article 1(2) of Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom, the objectives of the SURE programme shall be:\n(a) to review and, if necessary, harmonise safety practice in the transport of radioactive materials in the Community;\n(b) to help to establish in countries participating in the TACIS programme an effective and reliable system of safeguards through cooperation measures;\n(c) to promote industrial cooperation and cooperation among regulatory bodies with those countries and the exchange of know-how within the nuclear industry to help them achieve high safety standards that are consistent with internationally recognised principles of nuclear safety for nuclear equipment and installations.", "The financial reference amount for the implementation of the SURE programme shall be ECU 9 million. Of this amount, ECU 3,6 million is for the period 1998 to 1999.\nThe financial reference amount for the period 2000 to 2002 shall be reviewed if the amount of ECU 5,4 million is not consistent with the financial perspective for that period.\nThe annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.", "In order to achieve the objectives referred to in Article 1, the Community shall contribute in particular to the funding of actions which:\n1. in the field of the safe transport of radioactive materials:\n- help to raise safety standards and facilitate the functioning of the internal market by identifying those harmonisation measures which are called for,\n- help to improve legislation further by developing experimentation and know-how,\n- evaluate technical aspects of incidents which have occurred during transport and learn the lessons for the future,\n- make emergency procedures relating to transport more consistent and give those involved more training,\n- enhance an efficient system of reporting in the event of an incident,\n- cooperate with countries participating in the TACIS programme to help them improve transport safety in these countries,\n- help to improve cooperation and the exchange of information between the relevant bodies in the Community and in the countries participating in the SURE programme as provided for in Article 7,\n- improve public information, comprehension and awareness in this area;\n2. in the field of safeguards in countries participating in the TACIS programme, relate to:\n- training, familiarisation, adding to experience, retraining and technological updating of experts from those countries in the matter of nuclear safeguards,\n- cooperation on the implementation of accounting and control systems for nuclear materials,\n- installation of modern logistical, evaluation and control equipment and the training relating thereto;\n3. in the field of industrial cooperation with the countries participating in the TACIS programme:\n- analyse the industrial, administrative, legal and financial context specific to each of them,\n- encourage industrial cooperation measures capable of transferring European nuclear safety technology and cooperation among regulatory bodies,\n- facilitate the cooperation of partners from the Community and countries participating in the TACIS programme in order to promote safety in nuclear installations, inter alia, in the development of joint industrial projects.", "The level of funding for the actions and measures referred to in Article 3 shall be between 80 and 100 % of their total cost.", "1. The Commission shall be responsible for the financial execution and implementation of the SURE programme.\n2. For the purposes of financial execution and of implementing the SURE programme, the Commission shall be assisted by the Committee referred to in Article 4 of Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom.", "The examination and internal and external assessment of the implementation of the SURE programme shall be carried out in accordance with Article 5 of Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom.", "The SURE programme shall be open to participation by associated central and east European countries in accordance with the conditions, including financial provisions, laid down in the additional protocols to the Association Agreements or in the Association Agreements themselves relating to participation in Community programmes. The SURE programme shall also be open to participation by Cyprus, on the basis of additional appropriations, under the same rules as those applied to EFTA/EEA countries, in accordance with procedures to be agreed with that country.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 1998.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nW.
