Since the release for free circulation would continue to be subject to the presentation of a certificate of origin, this simplification can be attained without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to take the necessary measures to satisfy themselves that the transactions have been carried out correctly.\n(4) In order to ensure a smooth transition to the simplified administrative requirements, it is appropriate to foresee to defer their application to 1 February 2012.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly\n(6) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["In Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 891/2009, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Balkan sugar, import licence applications shall be accompanied by the original of the export licence, in accordance with the model in Annex II, issued by the competent authorities of the third country concerned.
