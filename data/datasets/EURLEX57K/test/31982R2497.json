it houses an unlocking piston actuated likewise by pressure; it has a link at its extremity jutting out of the cylinder for the purpose of securing the cargo door actuator; the actuator opens or closes by extending or retracting; by this means the cargo door is opened or closed,\n- two latch hooks, secured to the cylinder casing, which, when there is no pressure on the unlocking piston, prevent the piston rod from being extended,\n- various springs, rings and other components necessary for the mechanism;\nWhereas the Common Customs Tariff annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 (2), as last amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/82 (3), lists under heading No 84.22 lifting machinery, under heading No 84.07 hydraulic engines and motors, and under heading No 84.08 other engines and motors such as vapour engines and power units, internal combustion piston engines and hydraulic engines and motors;\nWhereas for the classification of the abovementioned mechanism the aforesaid headings merit consideration;\nWhereas the abovementioned mechanism is not a complete lifting machine and has not the essential charactr of a complete lifting machine, because it lacks not only the actuator operating the lifting action but also a support or another auxiliary mechanism, which in combination with the power of the pressure cylinder make the lifting action possible; whereas the aforesaid mechanism is only part of such a lifting machine;\nWhereas by application of note 2 (a) to Section XVI, heading No 84.22 does not cover parts of lifting machinery of a kind described in any of the headings of Chapter 84;\nWhereas ram cylinders, consisting of a cylinder in which a piston is hydraulically or pneumatically set in motion so that the hydraulic or pneumatic energy acting on the piston is converted into a linear movement, are hydraulic or pneumatic engines and motors which fall within heading No 84.07 or 84.08; whereas the presence of certain components, like unlocking pistons, latch hooks, springs and rings does not influence the classification of such engines and motors;\nWhereas the abovementioned mechanism, according to whether hydraulically or pneumatically operated, is therefore to be classified under heading No 84.07 as a hydraulic engine or motor or under heading No 84.08 as a pneumatic engine or motor;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature,", "main_body": ["The mechanism, operated by hydraulic or pneumatic pressure to extend and retract the aircraft cargo door actuator and consisting of:\n- a cylinder, with a connecting piece provided for securing the cargo door at one extremity and a\npiston rod out of the other extremity, linearly extended by hydraulic or pneumatic energy acting on the piston in the cylinder casing,\n- a piston with piston rod, housing an unlocking piston actuated likewise by pressure;
