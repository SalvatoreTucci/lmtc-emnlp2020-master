In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 stipulates that the use of casein and caseinates in the manufacture of cheese is subject to prior authorisation. It is necessary to lay down detailed rules for the grant of such authorisations, having regard to the requirements as regards checks on undertakings. Authorisations should be granted for a limited period, so that the Member States can impose penalties for failure to comply with Community provisions.\n(3) The second paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 stipulates that the maximum percentages of casein and caseinates to be incorporated in cheese must be determined on the basis of objective criteria laid down having regard to what is technologically necessary. It is necessary to determine the said percentages on the basis of data supplied by the Member States. In order to facilitate checks to ensure compliance with this provision, it is advisable to set overall percentages rather than percentages for individual products.\n(4) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 requires Member States to introduce administrative and physical controls. It is necessary to specify the conditions which these controls should fulfil, particularly with regard to their frequency.\n(5) Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 states that a sum equal to 110\u00a0% of the difference between the value of the skimmed milk necessary for producing 100 kilograms of caseins and caseinates resulting from the market price of skimmed milk powder on the one hand and the market price for casein and caseinates on the other hand is due per 100 kilograms for quantities of caseins and caseinates used without authorisation. This sum has to be determined having regard to prices recorded on the markets during a reference period.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorisations referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02204/90 shall be granted for a period of 12\u00a0months, at the request of the undertakings concerned, subject to their giving a prior undertaking in writing to accept and comply with the provisions of Article 3(1)(a) and (b) on the one hand, and Article 3(1)(c) on the other, of that Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorisations shall be issued with a serial number for each undertaking or, where necessary, for each production unit.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorisations may cover one or more types of cheese, in accordance with the application made by the undertaking concerned.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The maximum percentages to be incorporated, as referred to in the second paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90, are given in Annex I to this Regulation.
