That Directive also lays down certain requirements concerning time limits for submission of plans.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC\u00a0(2) lists the third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.\n(3) Certain third countries have presented residue monitoring plans to the Commission for animals and products not listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. The evaluation of these plans and the additional information requested by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring in these countries for the concerned animals and products. These animals and products should therefore be included in the list for these third countries.\n(4) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 12 October 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 September 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 10.
