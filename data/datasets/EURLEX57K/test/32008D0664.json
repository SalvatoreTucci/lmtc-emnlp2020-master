The derogation was extended by Commission Decision 2005/294/EC\u00a0(3) in connection with the Danish action programme 2004-2007.\n(3) On 17 April 2008, Denmark requested a new extension of the derogation. The request was accompanied by a detailed technical motivation.\n(4) Danish legislation transposing Directive 91/676/EEC can be considered to be in compliance with Directive and its provisions apply equally to the derogation.\n(5) In December 2003 Denmark completed the evaluation of its Second Action Plan on aquatic environment which indicated the achievement of the reduction target for nitrate leaching of 48\u00a0% in the period 1985-2003.\n(6) The Danish Parliamentary agreement on the Third Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment 2005-2015 sets the objectives for a further reduction of nitrate leaching by 13\u00a0% and for a reduction of phosphate surplus by 50\u00a0% in the period 2005-2015. In 2007 the Government Platform agreed on the development of a Fourth Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment by 2009 that will serve as a health check of the Third Action Plan and will include adjustments to national legislation in order to ensure achievement of the objectives by 2015.\n(7) Denmark has established an action programme for the period 2008-2011 in conformity with Article 5 of Directive 91/676/EEC. The measures of the action programme form an integral part of the Third Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment.\n(8) Results of monitoring and controls show that, in period 2005-2006, 1\u00a0779 cattle holdings, 220\u00a0839 livestock units and 115\u00a0336 hectare, corresponding respectively to 3,4\u00a0%, 10,3\u00a0% and 4,2\u00a0% of the total in Denmark were encompassed by the derogation.\n(9) Calculations on nitrate leaching based on survey and nutrient analysis in agricultural catchments, show that, in the period 1990-2006, nitrate leaching has been reduced by 40\u00a0% in loamy soils and by 49\u00a0% in sandy soils. Since 2002-2003 leaching rates are almost constant.\n(10) Trend analysis of measured nitrate concentration in water leaving the root zones over the period 1990-2006, shows a reduction of 29\u00a0% and 45\u00a0% respectively for loamy and sandy soils. In 2006, nitrate average concentration in upper groundwater of the reference catchments was below 50\u00a0mg/l, both for sandy and loamy soils. Nitrate concentration in streams in the agricultural reference catchments decreased by 31\u00a0% in the period 1990-2006, with nitrate average concentrations lower than 20\u00a0mg/l for the sandy soils and around 30\u00a0mg/l for the loamy soils.\n(11) The Commission, after examination of Denmark's request and in the light of the experience gained from the derogation as provided in Decisions 2002/915/EC and 2005/294/EC considers that the amount of manure envisaged by Denmark, 230 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, if the same strict conditions established by Decision 2005/294/EC are met.\n(12) Decision 2005/294/EC expired on 31 July 2008. For the purpose of ensuring that the cattle farmers concerned may continue to benefit from the derogation, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2005/294/EC. The reporting obligations set by Decision 2005/294/EC should also be adapted.\n(13) The articles provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/294/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
