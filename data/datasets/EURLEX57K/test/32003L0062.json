The applications and data were reviewed, and for some combinations, the data was sufficient to justify the fixing of an MRL above the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(3) The acute and lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides arising from their uses in plant protection and, where applicable, in veterinary medicine has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(6) and it has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed in this Directive do not give rise to a violation of the acceptable daily intakes or the acute reference doses.\n(4) The Community's trading partners will be consulted about the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels will be considered.\n(5) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides and on the application of the methodology, referred to above, by the Rapporteur Member States have been taken into account(7).\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The maximum levels for residues listed in the Annex to this Directive shall replace those listed in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC for the pesticides in question.", "In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following rows are replaced:\n\">TABLE>\"", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 July 2003 at the latest.
