10(4) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Outbreaks of classical swine fever have occurred in Germany.\n(2) In view of the trade in live pigs and certain pig products, those outbreaks are liable to endanger the herds of other Members States.\n(3) Commission Decision 2006/254/EC of 28 March 2006 concerning certain interim protection measures relating to Classical Swine Fever in Germany\u00a0(2) was therefore adopted in order to reinforce the measures taken by Germany pursuant to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever\u00a0(3).\n(4) The animal health conditions and the certification requirements for trade in live pigs are laid down in Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine\u00a0(4).\n(5) The animal health conditions and certification requirements for trade in porcine semen are laid down in Council Directive 90/429/EEC of 26 June 1990

the laboratory tests for the confirmation of classical swine fever\u00a0(7) provides for risk adapted surveillance protocols.\n(8) Based on the information provided by Germany it is appropriate to maintain protective measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany for a period sufficient to complete the necessary investigations.\n(9) It is also necessary to extent the measures so as to minimise contacts to and between pig holdings in certain parts of Germany and to require a regional limitation of certain services related to pigs so as to prevent spread of disease.\n(10) Decision 2006/254/EC should be repealed.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body":
