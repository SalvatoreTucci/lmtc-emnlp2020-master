As a consequence, Costa Rica was included in the list of countries exempted from certain TSE-related trade conditions for live bovine animals and products of bovine, ovine and caprine origin.\n(2) In its updated opinion of 10 April 2003 on the geographical BSE risk of certain third countries, the SSC modified its opinion of 11 May 2001 and concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle of Costa Rica is unlikely but may not be excluded. Therefore Costa Rica should no longer be exempted from the TSE-related trade conditions for live bovine animals and products of bovine, ovine and caprine origin.\n(3) In its opinion of 6 March 2003 on the geographical BSE risk in New Caledonia, the SSC concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle of that country is highly unlikely. Therefore, New Caledonia should be included in the list of countries exempted from certain TSE-related trade conditions for live bovine animals and products of bovine, ovine and caprine origin.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 October 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 160, 27.6.2003, p. 22.\nANNEX\nAnnex XI is amended as follow:\n1.
