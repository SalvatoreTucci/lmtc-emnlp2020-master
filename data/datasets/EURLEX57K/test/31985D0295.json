but whereas dieldrin was not in fact used by the grower concerned;\nWhereas vine weevil has not previously been known to be a problem on gooseberry and blackcurrant bushes under the climatic conditions usually prevailing in Ireland;\nWhereas the exceptionally dry and warm weather enjoyed in Ireland during the 1984 growing season was particularly favourable to the reproduction and development of the vine weevil;\nWhereas, because of the unforeseeable nature of the infestation, it was not recognized until an official inspection took place on 12 October 1984; whereas it was by then urgent to put in hand a control programme to prevent further damage to the plantations;\nWhereas active substances intended for the control of vine weevil in gooseberries and blackcurrants, other than aldrin and dieldrin, have not yet proved to be effective under Irish conditions; but whereas aldrin and dieldrin have proved effective for the control of vine weevil in a wide range of plant genera;\nWhereas vine weevil has now proved to be a serious pest of gooseberries and blackcurrants for the control of which further treatment will be necessary before trials of alternative active substances can be undertaken in Ireland; whereas Ireland has informed the Commission that further national emergency legislation will be necessary in 1985 to deal with the outbreak on the holding concerned;\nWhereas in certain Member States other active substance, such as carbofuran and oxamyl have been found effective for the control of wine weevil in strawberries and vines;\nWhereas there is no authorized agricultural use of dieldrin in the Community; whereas, for the purposes intended, aldrin is equally effective so that further authorization of the use of dieldrin is unnecessary;\nWhereas by virtue of Article 7 (2) of Directive 79/117/EEC it should be established without delay whether, and if so under what conditions, the action taken by Ireland may be continued or repeated;\nWhereas, therefore, that Ireland may repeat the treatment of the said plantations of gooseberry and blackcurrant in the County of Wexford with aldrin, subject to the condition that a simultaneous trial of alternative active substances be carried out to determine whether any alternative active substance is effective for the control of vine weevil in gooseberry or blackcurrant;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Ireland may, during the 1985 growing season, authorize the supply and use of aldrin, under the supervision of officials of the Department of Agriculture, for the treatment of blackcurrant and gooseberry plantations on a single holding situated in the townlands of Ballykelly, Killiane Little and Sheepwalk in the County of Wexford to control effectively an infestation of vine weevil provided that the conditions specified in Article 2 are fulfilled.", "1. Trials shall be conducted during the 1985 growing season, under the supervision of officials of the Department of Agriculture and in accordance with generally recognized procedures, as to the efficacy for the control of vine weevil in gooseberry and blackcurrant plantations situated in Ireland of active substances other than substances prohibited by virtue of the provisions of Directive 79/117/EEC for this purpose, and in particular of carbofuran and oxamyl.\n2. Ireland shall send to the other Member States and to the Commission a full report on those trials by 31 March 1986 at the latest.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 May 1985.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 33, 8. 2. 1979, p. 36.\n(2) OJ No L 91, 9. 4. 1983, p. 35."}
