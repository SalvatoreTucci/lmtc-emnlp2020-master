This Regulation takes full account of the resulting mandate report of 30 December 2004 issued by Eurocontrol.\n(3) This Regulation does not cover military operations and training as referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004.\n(4) The Member States undertook, in a Statement on Military Issues related to the Single European Sky\u00a0(3), to cooperate with each other, taking into account national military requirements, in order to ensure that the concept of flexible use of airspace is fully and uniformly applied in all Member States by all users of airspace.\n(5) The report issued jointly by the Eurocontrol Performance Review Unit and the Eurocontrol agency in October 2001 states that there is a significant scope for improving the current application of the flexible use of airspace within Europe. Common rules for giving effect to that improvement should now be adopted.\n(6) The of the flexible use of airspace concept covers also airspace over the high seas. Its application should therefore be without prejudice to the rights and duties of Member States under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) of 7 December 1944 and its annexes, or to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n(7) There are activities which require the reservation of a volume of airspace for their exclusive or specific use for determined periods, owing to the characteristics of their flight profile or their hazardous attributes and the need to ensure effective and safe separation from non-participating air traffic.\n(8) Effective and harmonised application of flexible use of airspace throughout the Community needs clear and consistent rules for civil-military coordination which should take into account all users\u2019 requirements and the nature of their various activities.\n(9) Efficient civil-military coordination procedures should rely on rules and standards to ensure efficient use of airspace by all users.\n(10) It is essential to further cooperation between neighbouring Member States and to take into account cross-border operations when applying the concept of flexible use of airspace.\n(11) Differences in the organisation of civil-military cooperation in the Community restrict uniform and timely airspace management. It is therefore essential to identify the persons and/or organisations which are responsible for the application of the flexible use of airspace concept in every Member State. This information should be made available to the Member States.\n(12) Consistent procedures for civil-military coordination and use of common airspace are an essential condition for the establishment of functional airspace blocks as defined in Regulation (EC) No 549/2004.\n(13) The flexible use of airspace addresses airspace management at strategic, pre-tactical and tactical levels, which are separate, but closely interdependent management functions and therefore need to be performed coherently to ensure efficient use of airspace.\n(14) Air-traffic management programmes under development in European level cooperation should allow for the progressive achievement of consistency between airspace management, air traffic flow management and air traffic services.\n(15) Where various aviation activities occur in the same airspace but meet different requirements, their coordination should seek both the safe conduct of flights and the optimum use of available airspace.\n(16) Accuracy of information on airspace status and on specific air traffic situations and timely distribution of this information to civil and military controllers has a direct impact on the safety and efficiency of operations.\n(17) Timely access to up-to-date information on airspace status is essential for all parties wishing to take advantage of airspace structures made available when filing or re-filing their flight plans.\n(18) The regular assessment of airspace use is an important way of increasing confidence between civil and military service providers and users and is an essential tool for improving airspace design and airspace management.\n(19) The annual report on application of the flexible use of airspace, as referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004, should contain relevant information, gathered in the light of the original objectives and with the sole view of better accommodating users\u2019 requirements.\n(20) A transitional period to meet requirements for coordination between civil air traffic services units and military air traffic services units and/or controlling military units should be provided.\n(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee established by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,", "main_body": ["Subject-matter\nThis Regulation reinforces and harmonises the application, within the Single European Sky, of the concept of the flexible use of airspace as defined in Article 2 point (22) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, in order to facilitate airspace management and air traffic management within the limits of the common transport policy.\nIn particular, this Regulation sets out rules to ensure better cooperation between civil and military entities responsible for air traffic management that operate in the airspace under the responsibility of Member States.", "Definitions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Regulation the definitions established by Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 shall apply.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the definitions referred to in paragraph 1, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018airspace management cell (AMC)\u2019 means a cell responsible for the day-to-day management of the airspace under the responsibility of one or more Member States;\n(b) \u2018airspace reservation\u2019 means a defined volume of airspace temporarily reserved for exclusive or specific use by categories of users;\n(c) \u2018airspace restriction\u2019 means a defined volume of airspace within which, variously, activities dangerous to the flight of aircraft may be conducted at specified times (a \u2018danger area\u2019);
