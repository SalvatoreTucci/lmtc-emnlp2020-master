The Finnish authorities considered that the two-hand control device fitted to the machinery was not designed to avoid being easily defeated or actuated by one hand or by other parts of the body.\n(4) The Commission wrote to the manufacturer inviting him to communicate his observations on the measure taken by Finland. In his reply, the manufacturer indicated that, following the measure, he had brought the design of the machinery into conformity for products manufactured from the autumn of 2010 and proposed corrective measures to deal with machines placed on the market before that date. Since the summer of 2011, the wedge splitter has been sold with the reference Hakki Pilke HH100.\n(5) The Finnish authorities have confirmed that the wedge splitters of the types Hakki Pilke Z100 and HH100 placed on the market since the autumn of 2010 comply with the requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC and that consequently the prohibition on the placing on the market and use of those machines has been lifted. However, the obligation to recall and bring into conformity wedge splitters manufactured before the autumn of 2010 remains in force.\n(6) Examination of the evidence provided by the Finnish authorities and of the observations communicated by the manufacturer confirms that wedge splitters of the type Hakki Pilke Z100 with a two-hand control device that can be easily defeated or actuated by one hand or by other parts of the body do not comply with the essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC and that this non-conformity gives rise to a serious risk of injury to users,", "main_body": ["The measure taken by the Finnish authorities prohibiting the placing on the market and use of wedge splitters of the type Hakki Pilke Z100 with a two-hand control device that can be easily defeated or actuated by one hand or by other parts of the body, and requiring the manufacturer to recall or bring into conformity non-compliant products already placed on the market is justified.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 24."}
