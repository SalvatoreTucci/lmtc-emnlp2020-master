The agreements are now being ratified by all signatory parties. Following the conclusions of those Agreements the structure and operation of the Union\u2019s trading regime for bananas of CN code 0803\u00a000\u00a019 have been changed.\n(3) In view of the new banana tariffs to be applied pursuant the \"Geneva Agreement\", Regulation (EU) No 306/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) has repealed Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 with effect on the date of entry into force of that Agreement.\n(4) In the light of the adoption of the aforementioned agreements, which settled a longstanding banana dispute, the use of import licences subject to the provision of a security, as a statistical tool, is no longer an adequate instrument to monitor the banana markets.\n(5) New and more accurate means of monitoring imports of bananas have been developed, which are less cumbersome than licences, which incur an administrative burden and a cost for companies and national administrations.\n(6) Therefore, it is appropriate to abolish the obligation for traders to obtain import licences for the importation of bananas of all origin. Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 should therefore be repealed. As Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 limits the validity of licences to the year of issue, it is appropriate to repeal the obligation to obtain import licences as from 1 January 2012.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 2.12.2005, p.1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 324, 10.12.2005, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 66.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 44."}
