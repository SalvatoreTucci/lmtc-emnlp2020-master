It is therefore necessary to stipulate what is required in the marketing strategy, the catch plan, and the production plan for both fishing and aquaculture producer organisations.\n(3) Producer organisations need to ensure internal discipline in order to ensure that the operational programme can be enforced. The penalties must be in proportion to the infringement and must be made known to the members in advance.\n(4) The timetable for submission by the producer organisations and approval by the competent national authorities of the operational programmes should be established to ensure an effective operation of the arrangements.\n(5) An advance should be granted to producer organisations in order to cover some of the financial costs incurred in establishing operational programmes.\n(6) It is appropriate to provide for a report to be submitted on the implementation of the operational programme at the end of the fishing year to enable the producer organisation to assess the effectiveness of its programme and to enable the national authorities to establish whether the financial compensation should be granted.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nMarketing strategy and catch plan for fishing producer organisations", "For the species in Annexes I and IV to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the marketing strategy referred to in Article 9(1)(a) of that Regulation shall include the following:\n(a) the number of registered members of the producer organisation on the first day of the fishing year as defined in Article 9(1) of this Regulation;\n(b) the number and type of fishing vessels that are members of the producer organisation on the first day of the fishing year;\n(c) the volume of production and intervention operations by species in the previous fishing year;\n(d) the aggregate turnover of the producer organisation in the previous fishing year;\n(e) the quota allocated to the producer organisation by species;\n(f) the percentage of fish sold through auctions or by other means in the previous fishing year;\n(g) the strategy to improve or maintain the quality of the products disposed of through the producer organisation or its members;\n(h) voluntary product labelling or other promotional activities;\n(i) proposed new outlets or other commercial opportunities.", "1.
