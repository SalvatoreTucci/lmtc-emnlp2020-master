Those Decisions provided that Member States are to suspend imports from certain parts of Croatia and Switzerland of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and certain other live birds, including pet birds and hatching eggs of those species, as well as certain products of birds.\n(4) Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC\u00a0(7) lays down certain biosecurity and restriction measures to prevent the spread of that disease, including the establishment of areas A and B following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of the disease in poultry.\n(5) Commission Decision 2006/563/EC of 11 August 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/115/EC\u00a0(8) lays down certain protection measures to prevent the spread of that disease from wild birds to poultry including, based on risk assessment, the establishment of control and monitoring areas taking into account the epidemiological, geographical and ecological factors following a suspected or confirmed positive finding for that disease in wild birds.\n(6) Croatia has notified the Commission that the competent authorities of that third country are applying protection measures that are equivalent to those applied by the competent authorities of the Member States, as provided for in Commission Decision 2006/563/EC, when highly pathogenic avian influenza of H5N1 subtype is suspected or confirmed in wild birds and that it will immediately notify the Commission of any future changes to its animal health status, including specifically any positive findings of that disease in wild birds.\n(7) Switzerland has notified the Commission that the competent authorities of that country are applying protection measures that are equivalent to those applied by the competent authorities of the Member States, as provided for in Decisions 2006/415/EC and 2006/563/EC, when highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 is suspected or confirmed in poultry or wild birds and that it will immediately notify the Commission of any future changes to its animal health status, including specifically any outbreak or positive findings of that disease in poultry or wild birds.
