This is due not so much to surplus production as to abundant supply on the domestic market because of the growing volume of stocks and of imports of wines from third countries. In particular, the Italian market has experienced considerable surpluses, in particular regarding white table wines; thus the level of table wine stocks has exceeded the 1999 level by 70 %. Furthermore, the average price for this type of wine has fallen by 23 % as compared with the 1998/99 wine year, resulting in a significant reduction in producers' income.\n(4) Voluntary distillation of table wine intended to supply the potable alcohol market provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 has not made it possible to improve the situation on the Italian market, as the contracts concluded have attained a level equivalent to double the authorised volumes.\n(5) This imbalance on the table wine market has led the Italian Government to request a crisis distillation measure under Article 30 of the said Regulation for 5 million hectolitres of table wine. Opening of that crisis distillation measure involves a price to be paid to the producer. The price adopted previously was EUR 1,914 per % vol, per hectolitre, which the Italian Government considers insufficient to bring about genuine improvement on the market.\n(6) To deal with the situation, the Italian Government is planning, within the 4 million hectolitre quota approved on 8 February 2002 by the Management Committee for Wine and on a proposal from the Commission, to grant exceptional national aid to producers who supply wine for the distillation referred to in Article 30 of the said Regulation, so as to bring the price paid to the producer for distillation purposes to a level not exceeding EUR 2,12 per % vol per hectolitre, subject to a maximum cost of this national measure of EUR 8,27 million.\n(7) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance which has arisen, to be compatible with the common market on the terms specified in this Decision,", "main_body": ["Exceptional aid by the Italian Government for the distillation of 4 million hectolitres of table wine on Italian territory totalling not more than EUR 8,27 million, for the amount necessary to bring the price of wine up to EUR 2,12 per % vol per hectolitre in the context of the implementation of crisis distillation under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, shall be considered compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 February 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
