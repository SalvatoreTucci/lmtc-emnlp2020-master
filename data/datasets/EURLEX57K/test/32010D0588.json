In a statement issued by the spokesperson of the High Representative Catherine Ashton on 19 February 2010, the EU roundly condemned the coup as being in contradiction with the very principles of democracy. In application of Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the EU has invited the Niger authorities to hold consultations in Brussels and has engaged in a political dialogue with the ruling regime in order to study the situation and possible solutions. The consultations opened on 8 December 2009 and a second round took place on 26 May 2010. Following that meeting the EU representatives expressed their willingness to propose to the Council of the European Union appropriate measures to support the transition under way in Niger towards a return to constitutional order, as announced by the Niger authorities.\nDuring the meeting of 26 May the participants discussed how to organise a return to constitutional rule and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and transparent elections. Niger also presented a memorandum on the stages and issues at stake in the transition. The EU noted the announcement of:\n\u2014 the establishment of pluralist institutions for the transition, representing all political elements in Niger,\n\u2014 the consensual adoption of an electoral code,\n\u2014 the establishment of a National Independent Election Commission (CENI).\nIt also welcomed the adoption of a roadmap which, by means of a number of electoral steps, paves the way for the establishment of a new constitutional framework and new democratically elected authorities. Finally, the EU noted the commitment made by members of the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) and the civilian government established in February 2010 to manage the transition, not to stand for election and to hand over power to the elected civilians at the end of the transitional period, planned for March 2011.\nThe EU noted proposals put forward by Niger during the discussions, in particular the following undertakings which it considers especially important:\n1. the adoption of basic texts by the CSRD;\n2. the organisation of a constitutional referendum on the basis of those texts;\n3. the holding of local, parliamentary and presidential elections by March 2011;\n4. respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties, including freedom of action for political parties;\n5. the decriminalisation of press offences and a guarantee of independence for regulatory bodies and of access to information;\n6. a commitment to sound economic and financial management throughout the transition.\nThe EU found the undertakings made by Niger to be broadly encouraging. It has therefore decided to adopt the appropriate measures listed in the annexed commitments table under Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement with a view to the gradual resumption of cooperation in order to assist in the transition.\nIn particular, the EU will continue to finance humanitarian and emergency operations in direct support of the people of Niger and measures to support the political transition and help end the crisis. In this context, the EU may provide fresh aid for the preparation of the parliamentary and presidential elections.\nHowever, the European Commission reserves the right, where necessary, to take over the duties of the EDF National Authorising Officer on its own account.\nAs part of the procedure under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the EU will continue to monitor the situation in Niger closely over a period of 12 months. During this period an enhanced dialogue will be pursued with the Niger Government under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement in order to support the transition process, and regular reviews will be conducted by the EU. The first follow-up mission will take place within no more than six months from the date of signature of this letter.\nThe EU reserves the right to amend the \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 in the light of progress in the implementation of commitments.\nThe EU also intends to hold, under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, a regular political dialogue with the new government formed after the elections, particularly on the subject of reforms in the field of political, judicial and economic governance and reforms in the security sector.\nWe have the honour to be, Sirs, yours faithfully,\nFor the Council\n\u2026\nFor the Commission\n\u2026\nANNEX TO THE ANNEX: SCHEDULE OF COMMITMENTS\nCommitments by partners\nNiger EU\n\u2014 Situation as of 26 May 2010\n\u2014 The European Union will continue to finance humanitarian and emergency operations in direct support of the people of Niger and measures to assist in the political transition and in ending the crisis\n\u2014 Consensual adoption of an electoral code (with the favourable opinion of the National Consultative Council)\n\u2014 Establishment of the Independent National Electoral Commission with a consensually chosen membership (with the favourable opinion of the National Consultative Council)\n\u2014 Resumption of the project Consolidation of Democracy, in particular the component for electoral support, and its extension until the forthcoming polls.
