Alternatively, the number of this Decision may be shown on any other official document accompanying the seed lot;\n(e) the certification authorities shall monitor the experiment;\n(f) samples from seed lots officially certified following this experiment shall be supplied for Community comparative trials.", "1. Any Member State may participate in the experiment.\n2. Member States shall inform the Commission whether they have decided to participate in the experiment.\n3. The experiment shall end on 30 June 1998. Member States may decide to cease to participate in the experiment at an earlier date.\n4. Before the end of each year Member States shall report to the Commission and to the other Member States progress reports on the results of the experiment.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 1996.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 169, 10. 7. 1969, p. 3.\n(2) OJ No L 91, 15. 4. 1993, p. 27."}
