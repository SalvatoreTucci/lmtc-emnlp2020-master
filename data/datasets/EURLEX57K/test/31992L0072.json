The volume must be standardized at the following conditions of temperature and pressure: 293 oK and 101,3 kPa)\n1. Health protection threshold\n110 \u00ecg/m\u00b3 for the mean value over eight hours (**)\n2. Vegetation protection thresholds\n200 \u00ecg/m\u00b3 for the mean value over one hour\n65 \u00ecg/m\u00b3 for the mean value over 24 hours\n3. Population information threshold\n180 \u00ecg/m\u00b3 for the mean value over one hour\n4. Population warning threshold\n360 \u00ecg/m\u00b3 for the mean value over one hour\n(*) Concentrations must be measured continuously.\n(**) The mean over eight hours is a non-overlapping moving average; it is calculated four times a day from the eight hourly values between 0 and 9.00, 8.00 and 17.00, 16.00 and 1.00, 12.00 and 21.00. For the information to be provided pursuant to\nArticle 6\n(1), first indent, the mean over eight hours is a simple moving average, calculated each hour h from the eight hourly values between h and h-9.\nANNEX II\nMONITORING OF OZONE CONCENTRATIONS  1. The purpose of measuring ozone concentrations in ambient air is to assess:\n(i) as closely as possible the individual risk of exposure of human beings to values in excess of the health protection thresholds;\n(ii) the exposure of vegetation (e.g. forests, natural ecosystems, crops, horticulture) to the values given in Annex I.\n2. The measurement points must be located at geographically and climatologically representative sites where:\n(i) the risk of approaching or exceeding the thresholds laid down in Annex I is the highest;\n(ii) it is likely that one of the targets referred to in paragraph 1 is exposed.\nAt places where the Member States do not have information concerning the sites referred to in (i) and (ii), they must carry out indicative measurement programmes in order to determine the siting of the measurement points to supply the data necessary for  the implementation of this Directive.\n3. Member States must establish or designate additional measurement points in order to:\n(i) contribute towards the identification and description of the formation and transport of ozone and its precursors;\n(ii) monitor changes in ozone concentrations in areas affected by background pollution.\nMandatory measurement of oxides of nitrogen and that recommended for volatile organic compounds be carried out in order to provide information on ozone formation, to monitor transboundary flows of volatile organic compounds and to make it possible to  identify links between the different pollutants.\n4. The final reading of the ozone measurement instruments must be carried out in such a way that the mean values over one hour and eight hours can be calculated, in accordance with Annexes I and III.\nANNEX III\nCALCULATION OF THE MEASUREMENT RESULTS FOR THE ANNUAL REFERENCE PERIOD  1. Concentrations must be measured continuously.\n2. The annual reference period will begin on 1 January and end on 31 December in any given calendar year.\n3. For the validity of the calculation of the percentiles (\u00b9) to be recognized, 75 % of the possible values must be available and, as far as possible, distributed uniformly throughout the period in question for the particular measurement site. If that  is not the case, this fact must be mentioned when the results are communicated.\nThe calculation of the 50th (98th) percentile on the basis of the values recorded throughout the year must be carried out as follows: the 50th (98th) percentile must be calculated from the values actually measured. The measured values must be rounded  off to the nearest \u00ecg/m\u00b3. All the values are to be listed in increasing order for each site:\nX1& {\u00cc9};X2& {\u00cc9};X3& {\u00cc9};. . . .& {\u00cc9};Xk& {\u00cc9};. . . . .& {\u00cc9};XN-1& {\u00cc9};XN.\nThe 50th (98th) percentile is the value of k, to be calculated from the following formula:\nk = 0,50(0,98)\u00b7N\nN being the number of values actually measured. The value of 0,50(0,98)\u00b7N must be rounded off to the nearest whole number.\nANNEX IV\nThe following information must be circulated on a sufficiently large scale as soon as possible to enable the population concerned to take all appropriate preventive protective action. The information in question must be  communicated to the media.\nList of minimum details to be supplied to the public in the event of the occurrence of high ozone levels in the air\n1. Date, hour and place of the occurrence of concentrations in excess of the thresholds defined in Annex I, points 3 and 4.\n2. Reference to the type(s) of Community values exceeded (information or warning).\n3. Forecasts: - change in concentrations (improvement, stabilization or deterioration),\n- geographical area concerned,\n- duration.\n4. Population concerned.\n5. Precautions to be taken by the population concerned.\n(1) The median must be calculated as the 50th percentile.\nANNEX V\nREFERENCE METHOD OF ANALYSIS TO BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DIRECTIVE  The reference method of analysis to be used in the context of this Directive to determine ozone is the UV absorption method. This method is being standardized by the ISO. Once  the latter has published the standard in question, the method described therein will constitute the reference method in this Directive.\nThe following points must be taken into consideration when the measurement methods and instruments are used by the Member States in the field:\n1. the conformity of the operating characteristics of the measurement instrument with those indicated by the manufacturer, in particular background noise, response time and linearity, must be verified initially in the laboratory and in the field;\n2. the instrument must be totally calibrated regularly, using a reference UV photometer as recommended by the ISO;\n3. in the field, the instruments must be calibrated regularly, e.g. every 23 or 25 hours. In addition, the validity of the calibration must be verified by regularly operating in parallel an instrument calibrated in accordance with paragraph 1.\nIf the instrument inlet filter is changed before calibration, calibration must be carried out after an appropriate period of exposure (from 30 minutes to several hours) of the filter to ambient ozone concentrations;\n4. the sampling head must be placed at least 1 m away from vertical screens in order to avoid any screening effect;\n5. the sampling head opening must be protected against rain and insects.\nNo prefilter is to be used;\n6. sampling must not be influenced by adjoining installations (air-conditioning or data-transmission equipment);\n7. the sampling line must be of inert material (e.g. glass, PTFE, stainless steel) which is not affected by the presence of ozone. It must be exposed beforehand to appropriate ozone concentrations;\n8. the sampling line between the sampling head and the analysis instrument must be as short as possible. In particular, the time taken for the gas volume sample to pass through the sampling line must be as short as possible (e.g. of the order of a few  seconds in the presence of other reagents such as NO);\n9. condensation in the sampling line must be avoided;\n10. the sampling line must be cleaned regularly, taking local conditions into account;\n11. the sampling line must be tight and the flow rate must be inspected regularly;\n12. sampling must not be influenced by gas discharges from the instrument or from the calibration system;\n13. all necessary precautions must be taken to prevent temperature variations from producing measurement errors."}
