Consequently the Commission adopted Decision 98/404/EC(3) introducing protective measures with regard to importation of equidae from Turkey.\n(2) Since the adoption of Decision 98/404/EC the competent authorities of Turkey have communicated to the Commission measures directed to improve veterinary supervision and export certification within the framework of the mission's recommendations.\n(3) Taking into account the results of the glanders surveillance programme carried out in Istanbul and the undertaking of the Turkish competent authorities to continue this programme throughout the country and to extend it to other relevant equine diseases, it appears appropriate to allow the re-entry after temporary export of Community registered horses coming directly from Istanbul where they participated in specific equestrian events.\n(4) Decision 98/404/EC must be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Decision 98/404/EC is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 1\n1.
