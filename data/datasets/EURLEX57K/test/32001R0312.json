Provision should be made for import licences to be issued in the period in question according to a monthly schedule.\n(3) For the sound management of the quantity in question, a mechanism must be created that encourages the operators to return immediately to the issuing agency licences that they will not use. It is also necessary to create a mechanism encouraging the operators to return the licences to the issuing agency after their date of expiry so that the unused quantities can be re-used.\n(4) Oil imported from Tunisia under the special scheme may not exceed a given quantity. Therefore, the tolerance laid down in Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(4) should not be applied.\n(5) Special detailed rules relating to the imports should be laid down. It is necessary in particular to fix the term of validity of the licences and the amount of the applicable security, notwithstanding Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1476/95(5).\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oil and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.
