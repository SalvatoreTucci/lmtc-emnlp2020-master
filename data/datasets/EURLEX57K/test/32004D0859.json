Therefore, the two parties agreed to submit for approval to their respective authorities some changes to the import arrangements applied by the parties to certain processed agricultural products. The changes will be implemented in the form of a Decision of the EEA Joint Committee amending Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement and of the present Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway.\nThe changes in Protocol No 2 will enter into force on 1 January 2005.\nThe two parties agree that the respective import arrangements below will replace the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters of 27 November 2002.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Norwegian import arrangements\nFrom 1 January 2005, Norway will open the following annual tariff quotas for the Community:\nNorwegian tariff codes Description Volume Applicable rate of duty\n1506.0021 Bonefat, bone oil and neat's foot oil 2\u00a0360 tonnes Free\n1518.0041 Linseed oil 100 tonnes Free\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Community Import arrangements\nFrom 1 January 2005, the Community will open the following annual tariff quotas for Norway:\nOrder number CN Code Description Volume Applicable rate of duty\n09.0765 1517\u00a010\u00a090 Margarine, excluding liquid margarine, containing, by weight, not more than 10% of milk fats 2\u00a0470 Free\n09.0771 ex22071000 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcohol strength by volume of 80% vol. or higher, other than that obtained from agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EEC Treaty 164\u00a0000 Free\n09.0772 ex22072000 Ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatured, of any strength, other than that obtained from agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EEC Treaty 14\u00a0340 Free\n09.0774 2403\u00a010 Smoking tobacco, whether or not containing tobacco substitutes in any proportion 370 Free\nIV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Community arrangements on certain soft drinks\n\u2014 From 1 January 2005, the present arrangements temporarily suspend the duty free regime applied under Protocol No\u00a02 to the bilateral free trade agreement to goods classified under CN codes 2202\u00a010\u00a000 (waters, including mineral waters and aerated waters, containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured) and ex22029010 (other non-alcoholic beverages containing sugar (sucrose or invert sugar)).\n\u2014 The Community will open an annual duty free tariff quota from 1 January to 31 December for goods originating in Norway and classified under CN codes 2202\u00a010\u00a000 (waters, including mineral waters and aerated waters, containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured) and ex22029010 (other non-alcoholic beverages containing sugar (sucrose or invert sugar)), for the following quantity: 14,3 million litres in 2005. Outside the quota allocation, the import duty will be 0,047 \u20ac/litre. The import duty may be revised annually on the basis of the difference in sugar prices between Norway and the Community.\n\u2014 On 31 October 2005, and on 31 October of each following year, if the tariff quota has been exhausted, the tariff quota applicable from 1 January of the following year will be increased by 10\u00a0%. If the quota has not been exhausted on that date, the products mentioned in paragraph 1 will be granted unlimited duty free access to the Community from 1 January to 31 December of the following year.\nV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quotas specified under II, III and IV shall be granted to originating products in accordance with the rules of origin laid down in Protocol No 3 to the 1973 Free Trade Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway.\nSir,\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today's date which reads as follows:\n\u2018I have the honour to confirm that the European Community is in agreement with the \u201cAgreed minutes\u201d attached to this letter concerning Protocol No\u00a02 to the bilateral free trade agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway.\nI should be obliged if you would confirm that the Government of the Kingdom of Norway is in agreement with the content of this letter.\u2019\nI have the honour to confirm that my Government is in agreement with the content of your letter and the proposed date of entry into force of the amendments.\nPlease accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.\nDone at Brussels,\nHecho en Bruselas, el\nV Bruselu dne\nUdf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxelles, den\nGeschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am\nBr\u00fcssel,\n\u0388\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03c5\u03be\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2\nFait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le\nFatto a Bruxelles, add\u00ed\nBrisel\u00ff,\nPriimta Briuselyje,\nKelt Br\u00fcsszelben,\nMag\u00ffmula fi Brussel,\nGedaan te Brussel,\nSporz\u00ffdzono w Brukseli, dnia\nFeito em Bruxelas,\nV Bruseli,\nV Bruslju,\nTehty Brysseliss\u00e4\nUtf\u00e4rdat i Bryssel den\n\u00centocmit la Bruxelles\nFor the Government of the Kingdom of Norway\nPor el Gobierno del Reino de Noruega\nZa vl\u00e1du Norsk\u00e9ho kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed\nP\u00e5 vegne af Kongeriget Norges regering\nIm Namen des K\u00f6nigreichs Norwegen\nNorra Kuningriigi valitsuse nimel\n\u0393\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03bf\u03c1\u03b2\u03b7\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\nPour le gouvernement du Royaume de Norv\u00e8ge\nPer il Governo del Regno di Norvegia\nNorv\u0113\u0123ijas Karalistes vald\u012bbas v\u0101rd\u0101\nNorvegijos Karalyst\u0117s Vyriausyb\u0117s vardu\nA Norv\u00e9g Kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g Korm\u00e1nya r\u00e9sz\u00e9r\u0151l\nG\u0127all-Gvern tar-Renju tan-Norve\u0121ja\nVoor de Regering van het Koninkrijk Noorwegen\nW imieniu Rz\u0105du Kr\u00f3lestwa Norwegii\nPelo Governo do Reino da Noruega\nZa vl\u00e1du N\u00f3rskeho kr\u00e1\u013eovstva\nZa vlado Kraljevine Norve\u0161ke\nNorjan kuningaskunnan hallituksen puolesta\nF\u00f6r Konungariket Norges regering\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 22, 24.1.2002, p. 34.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 27.6.1973, p. 2."}
