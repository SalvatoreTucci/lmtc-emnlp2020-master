It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(10), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(11), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(12), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(13), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(14) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(15) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.\n(9) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(16), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary are not eligible for export refunds.\n(10) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(17), with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, are not eligible for export refunds.\n(11) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n(12) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed either in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 respectively, are fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 23 January 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 January 2004.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(4) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n(5) OJ L 117, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 106, 29.4.2003, p. 12.\n(7) OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n(8) OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.\n(9) OJ L 242, 12.9.2001, p. 3.\n(10) OJ L 151, 19.6.2003, p. 1.\n(11) OJ L 163, 1.7.2003, p. 1.\n(12) OJ L 163, 1.7.2003, p. 19.\n(13) OJ L 163, 1.7.2003, p. 38.\n(14) OJ L 163, 1.7.2003, p. 56.\n(15) OJ L 163, 1.7.2003, p. 73.\n(16) OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 10.\n(17) OJ L 278, 29.10.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 23 January 2004 to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n>TABLE>"}
