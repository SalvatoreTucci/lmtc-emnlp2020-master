Whereas the disparities between national legislations on contracts relating to the purchase of  the right to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis are likely to create  barriers to the proper operation of the internal market and distortions of competition and lead to  the compartmentalization of national markets;\n2.  Whereas the aim of this Directive is to establish a minimum basis of common rules on such  matters which will make it possible to ensure that the internal market operates properly and will  thereby protect purchasers; whereas it is sufficient for those rules to cover contractual  transactions only with regard to those aspects that relate to information on the constituent parts  of contracts, the arrangements for communicating such information and the procedures and  arrangements for cancellation and withdrawal; whereas the appropriate instrument to achieve that  aim is a Directive; whereas this Directive is therefore consistent with the principle of  subsidiarity;\n3.  Whereas the legal nature of the rights which are the subject of the contracts covered by this  Directive varies considerably from one Member State to another; whereas reference should therefore  be made in summary form to those variations, giving a sufficiently broad definition of such  contracts, without thereby implying harmonization within the Community of the legal nature of the  rights in question;\n4.  Whereas this Directive is not designed to regulate the extent to which contracts for the use of  one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis may be concluded in Member States or the  legal basis for such contracts;\n5.  Whereas, in practice, contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use one or more  immovable properties on a timeshare basis differ from tenancy agreements; whereas that difference  can be seen from, inter alia, the means of payment;\n6.  Whereas it may be seen from the market that hotels, residential hotels and other similar  residential tourist premises are involved in contractual transactions similar to those which have  made this Directive necessary;\n7.  Whereas it is necessary to avoid any misleading or incomplete details in information concerned  specifically with the sale of the rights to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare  basis; whereas such information should be supplemented by a document which must be made available  to anyone who requests it; whereas the information therein must constitute part of the contract for  the purchase of the right to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis;\n8.  Whereas, in order to give purchasers a high level of protection and in view of the specific  characteristics of systems for using immovable properties on a timeshare basis, contracts for the  purchase of the right to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis must include  certain minimal items;\n9.  Whereas, with a view to establishing effective protection for purchasers in this field, it is  necessary to stipulate minimum obligations with which vendors must comply vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis purchasers;\n10.  Whereas the contract for the purchase of the right to use one or more immovable properties on  a timeshare basis must be drawn up in the official language or one of the official languages of the  Member State in which the purchaser is resident or in the official language or one of the official  languages of the Member State of which he is a national which must be one of the official languages  of the Community; whereas, however, the Member State in which the purchaser is resident may require  that the contract be drawn up in its language or its languages which must be an official language  or official languages of the Community; whereas provision should be made for a certified  translation of each contract for the purposes of the formalities to be completed in the Member  State in which the relevant property is situated;\n11.  Whereas to give the purchaser the chance to realize more fully what his obligations and rights  under the contract are he should be allowed a period during which he may withdraw from the contract  without giving reasons since the property in question is often situated in a State and subject to  legislation which are different from his own;\n12.  Whereas the requirement on the vendor's part that advance payments be made before the end of  the period during which the purchaser may withdraw without giving reasons may reduce the  purchaser's protection; whereas, therefore, advance payments before the end of that period should  be prohibited;\n13.  Whereas in the event of cancellation of or withdrawal from a contract for the purchase of the  right to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis the price of which is entirely  or partly covered by credit granted to the purchaser by the vendor or by a third party on the basis  of an agreement concluded between that third party and the vendor, it should be provided that the  credit agreement should be cancelled without penalty;\n14.  Whereas there is a risk, in certain cases, that the consumer may be deprived of the protection  provided for in this Directive if the law of a non-Member State is specified as the law applicable  to the contract; whereas this Directive should therefore include provisions intended to obviate  that risk;\n15.  Whereas it is for the Member States to adopt measures to ensure that the vendor fulfils his  obligations,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Directive shall be to approximate the laws,  regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the protection of purchasers in  respect of certain aspects of contracts relating directly or indirectly to the purchase of the  right to use one or more immovable properties on a timeshare basis.\nThis Directive shall cover only those aspects of the above provisions concerning contractual  transactions that relate to:\n-  information on the constituent parts of a contract and the arrangements for the communication of  that information,\n-  the procedures and arrangements for cancellation and withdrawal.\nWith due regard to the general rules of the Treaty, the Member States shall remain competent for  other matters, inter alia determination of the legal nature of the rights which are the subject of  the contracts covered by this Directive.", "For the purposes of this Directive:\n-  'contract relating directly or indirectly to the purchase of the right to use one or more  immovable properties on a timeshare basis`, hereinafter referred to as 'contract`, shall mean any  contract or group of contracts concluded for at least three years under which, directly or  indirectly, on payment of a certain global price, a real property right or any other right relating  to the use of one or more immovable properties for a specified or specifiable period of the year,  which may not be less than one week, is established or is the subject of a transfer or an  undertaking to transfer,\n-  'immovable property` shall mean any building or part of a building for use as accommodation to  which the right which is the subject of the contract relates,\n-  'vendor` shall mean any natural or legal person who, acting in transactions covered by this  Directive and in his professional capacity, establishes, transfers or undertakes to transfer the  right which is the subject of the contract,\n-  'purchaser` shall mean any natural person who, acting in transactions covered by this Directive,  for purposes which may be regarded as being outwith his professional capacity, has the right which  is the subject of the contract transferred to him or for whom the right which is the subject of the  contract is established.", "1.
