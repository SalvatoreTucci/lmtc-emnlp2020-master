whereas that price must be determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market;\nWhereas the import levy on unrefined olive oil obtained entirely from olives harvested in Greece and transported directly from that country into the Community is calculated by means of a free-at-frontier price determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the Greek market ; whereas the criteria used to determine the c.i.f. price should also be used to determine this price;\nWhereas when the c.i.f. and free-at-frontier prices are being determined, the Commission should take into consideration all offers known to it made on the world market and on the Greek market ; whereas, if there are no such offers, or if such offers are not representative, the Commission should be required to take into consideration offers on the Community market for imported olive oil ; whereas in the absence of such offers the c.i.f. and the free-at-frontier prices must be calculated on the basis of prices on the domestic markets of the main exporting and producing third countries and on the Greek market, insofar as these prices relate to actual export opportunities ; whereas, in the absence of such prices, the prices used to calculate the previous levy should be used;\nWhereas offers for products which are considered not to be representative as regards quantity, quality or presentation must be disregarded ; whereas information relating to long-term offers should also be disregarded since it does not reflect the position of products available for immediate sale;\nWhereas c.i.f. and free-at-frontier prices must be determined for a Community frontier crossing point ; whereas, where the offers taken into account are for another frontier crossing point, they must be adjusted to take transport and insurance costs into account ; whereas, moreover, criteria must be laid down for converting prices relating to offers on the Community market, on the domestic markets of the main exporting and producing third countries, and on the Greek market to the c.i.f. or free-at-frontier price stage;\nWhereas provision must be made for adjustments in respect of offers concerning products presented otherwise than in bulk ;
