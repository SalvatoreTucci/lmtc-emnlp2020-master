The Union seeks to develop relations and build partnerships with, inter alia, international organisations which share these principles.\n(2) One of the objectives of the Union is to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n(3) The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (hereinafter the \u2018Rome Statute\u2019) entered into force on 1 July 2002.\n(4) All Member States have ratified the Rome Statute.\n(5) The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the International Criminal Court (hereinafter the \u2018ICC\u2019), are fully in line with the principles and objectives of the Union. The serious crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC are of concern to the international community as a whole and to the Union and its Member States.\n(6) The Union and its Member States are determined to put an end to the impunity of the perpetrators of those crimes by taking measures at national level and by enhancing international cooperation to ensure their effective prosecution.\n(7) The Union and the ICC signed an agreement on cooperation and assistance on 10 April 2006 which entered into force on 1 May 2006\u00a0(1).\n(8) The principles and rules of international criminal law embodied in the Rome Statute should be taken into account in other international legal instruments.\n(9) The Union is convinced that universal accession to the Rome Statute is essential for the full effectiveness of the ICC and, to that end, considers that initiatives to enhance the acceptance of the Rome Statute are to be encouraged, provided they are consistent with the letter and spirit of the Rome Statute.\n(10) It is most important that the integrity of the Rome Statute and the independence of the ICC be preserved.\n(11) By its Conclusions of 30 September 2002 on the International Criminal Court the Council has developed a set of principles attached to those Conclusions to serve as guidelines for Member States when considering the necessity and scope of possible agreements or arrangements in responding to proposals regarding the conditions to surrender persons to the ICC.\n(12) On 25 May 2010, the Council adopted Conclusions on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (hereinafter the \u2018Review Conference\u2019), which was held in Kampala, Uganda, from 31 May to 11 June 2010.\n(13) The Review Conference adopted amendments to the Rome Statute, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 2 thereof to define the crime of aggression and to establish conditions under which the ICC could exercise jurisdiction with respect to that crime; adopted amendments to the Rome Statute to expand the jurisdiction of the ICC to three additional war crimes when committed in armed conflicts not of an international character; and decided to retain, for the time being, Article 124 of the Rome Statute. Those amendments are subject to ratification or acceptance and shall enter into force in accordance with Article 121, paragraph 5 of the Rome Statute. The ICC shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Rome Statute.\n(14) The Union pledged at the Review Conference to review and update its instruments in support of the ICC and to continue the promotion of the universality and preservation of the integrity of the Rome Statute.\n(15) The implementation of the Rome Statute requires practical measures that the Union and its Member States should fully support.\n(16) The Action Plan which was, inter alia, called for by a Resolution on entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court approved by the European Parliament on 28 February 2002 to follow up Council Common Position 2001/443/CFSP of 11 June 2001 on the International Criminal Court\u00a0(2) was adopted on 4 February 2004 and should be adapted as appropriate.\n(17) In the light of the above, Common Position 2003/444/CFSP of 16 June 2003 on the International Criminal Court\u00a0(3) should be repealed and replaced by this Decision,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The International Criminal Court (hereinafter the \u2018ICC\u2019), for the purpose of preventing and curbing the commission of the serious crimes falling within its jurisdiction, is an essential means of promoting respect for international humanitarian law and human rights, thus contributing to freedom, security, justice and the rule of law as well as contributing to the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of this Decision is to advance universal support for the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (hereinafter the \u2018Rome Statute\u2019) by promoting the widest possible participation in it, to preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute, to support the independence of the ICC and its effective and efficient functioning, to support cooperation with the ICC, and to support the implementation of the principle of complementarity.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to contribute to the objective of the widest possible participation in the Rome Statute, the Union and its Member States shall make every effort to further this process by raising the issue of the widest possible ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the Rome Statute and the implementation of the Rome Statute in negotiations, including negotiations of agreements, or political dialogues with third States, groups of States or relevant regional organisations, whenever appropriate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union and its Member States shall contribute to the worldwide participation in and implementation of the Rome Statute also by other means, such as by adopting initiatives to promote the dissemination of the values, principles and provisions of the Rome Statute and related instruments.
