Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. In particular, in order to ensure fluid supply to the Community market, the intervals at which import licence applications are to be submitted provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006\u00a0(3), should be maintained, and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 on this point.\n(2) The experience gained in the initial months of applying Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 suggests that improvements should be made to the common management rules laid down by that Regulation.\n(3) In accordance with Article 7(2) Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, where release for free circulation does not take place in the Member State which issued the import licence, the Member State of release for free circulation shall keep the original import licence. To allow the operator to use the remaining quantities of the import licences and to facilitate the release of the security of the import licence, only a copy of the import licence should be kept by that Member State.\n(4) The communications of the Member States to the Commission specified in Article 8(b)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 should also include the quantities imported in the form of white sugar.\n(5) In accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, in the period from 30 June to the end of the marketing year, any Community full-time refiner may submit applications for import licences for sugar for refining in all Member States within the limits of the quantities per Member State for which import licences for sugar for refining may be issued. In such cases the obligation under Article 4(2) second subparagraph of that Regulation to submit the application to the competent authorities of the Member State in which they are registered for VAT purposes should not apply.\n(6) If sugar imported as sugar for refining is not refined within the period set in Article 4(4)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, only the holder of the import licence shall pay an amount equal to EUR 500 per tonne for the quantities of sugar not refined. Therefore, the same penalty provided for in Article 11(3)(a) for the approved sugar producer should be deleted.\n(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1894/2006 of 18 December 2006 concerning the implementation of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and Brazil relating to the modification of concessions in the schedules of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic in the course of accession to the European Community, amending and supplementing Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(4), the Community has undertaken to import from Brazil a tariff rate quota of 10\u00a0124 tonnes of raw cane sugar for refining at a rate of duty of EUR 98 per tonne.\n(8) That quota should be opened and administered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 as \u2018CXL Concessions sugar\u2019. Since Article 24 of that Regulation opens the tariff quotas for CXL Concessions sugar on a marketing year basis, the annual tariff quota for raw cane sugar for refining originating in Brazil should be adjusted to take account of the fact that the marketing year 2006/2007 covers 15 months.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4(2), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n2.
