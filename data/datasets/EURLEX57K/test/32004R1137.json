It was noted that the quantities set for some products are systematically under-used, while applications for other products exceed the maximum quantities, resulting in a reduction coefficient being applied. It would seem justified, therefore, to redistribute the quantities among products in such a way as to follow the trends observed and adjust the amounts of aid for certain products, in accordance with the experience gained and results recorded, in order to make better use of resources.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 43/2003 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of all the management committees for the products concerned,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 43/2003 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply:\n(a) as regards the quantities laid down in column III of the new Annex IV, from 1 January 2004;\n(b) as regards the amounts of aid laid down in columns IV and V of the new Annex IV, to contracts concluded after its entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 26.
