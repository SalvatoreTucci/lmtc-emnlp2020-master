The United Kingdom should therefore be authorised to augment natural alcoholic strength by up to 4,5 % vol and the year to which this derogation relates, together with the other relevant information, should be included in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is hereby supplemented as follows:\n\">TABLE>\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 194, 31.7.2000, p. 1."}
