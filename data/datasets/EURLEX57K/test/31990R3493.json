'sheepmeat and/or goatmeat producer' means: an individual farmer, whether a natural or a legal person, who, on a permanent basis, assumes the risks and/or organizes the rearing of at least 10 ewes or, in the case of the areas referred to in Article 5  (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, 10 ewes and/or she-goats within the territory of a single Member State. For the purposes of applying this Regulation, the farmer is the owner of the flock, except for special cases still to be determined which arise  from contractual forms provided for in agricultural law or covered by national customs and practices under which the farmer, while assuming the risks and/or organization of the rearing, is not the owner of all or part of the flock;\n2. 'producer group' means: any form of group, association or cooperation involving reciprocal rights and obligations between producers of sheepmeat and/or goatmeat. Associations the object of which is the joint rearing of the flock in a such a manner  that ownership of it cannot be attributed to its members individually are also considered to be producer groups, provided that it is established that those members personally assume the risks and/or the organization of rearing;\n3. 'holding' means: all production units managed by the producer or made available to him and located within the territory of one and the same Member State.\nThe Commission shall, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, adopt the implementing provisions for this Article and in particular for the special cases referred to in point 1 thereof and the  arrangements for fixing the limits provided for in Article 5 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 with regard to the producer groups.", "1. The limits laid down in Article 5 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 shall apply individually to each producer even where the latter is a member of one or more producer groups. In the latter case a producer may qualify only once for the  premium at the full rate within the abovementioned limits.\n2. 'Producer in a less-favoured area' means any producer of sheepmeat or goatmeat within the meaning of Article 1 (1) whose holding is located in the areas defined pursuant to Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC.\nA producer of sheepmeat or goatmeat whose holding has at least 50 % of its agricultural area utilized for farming within the meaning of Article 5b of Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organization of Community surveys on the  structure of agriculture holdings between 1988 and 1997 (1) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 807/89 (2) in such areas and is used for sheep and/or goat production shall also be regarded as a producer in a less-favoured area.\n3. Furthermore, a farmer practising transhumance shall be regarded as a producer in a less-favoured area provided that:\n- at least 90 % of the animals for which the premium is applied are grazed for at least 90 consecutive days in the areas defined in Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC, and\n- the seat of the holding is situated in a well-defined geographical area for which it has been established that transhumance is a traditional practice of sheep and/or goat rearing and that these animal movements are necessary owing to the absence of  forage in sufficient quantity during the transhumance period.\n4. The Commission shall, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, determine in particular the geographical areas referred to in paragraph 3.", "The ewe premiums referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 shall be paid only if they exceed an amount to be determnined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of the said Regulation; where a premium is less  than this amount, it shall be added to the premium payable per ewe in respect of the following marketing year in the region or regions concerned.", "Where it is noted, after the end of a marketing year, that the amount of the advance payments aid pursuant to Article 5 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 is higher than the amount of the premium payable per ewe in respect of the marketing  year in question, an amount corresponding to the difference shall be deducted from the amount of the premium payable per ewe to be paid in respect of the following marketing year.", "Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 is hereby repealed, with the exception of Article 1 (2), (3) and (4), and of the Annex, application of which shall be limited to the premiums to be paid in respect of the 1991 marketing year.\nNot later than 31 May 1991 the Council shall adopt the definitions of the terms 'eligible ewe', 'eligible she-goat' and 'eligible female of the ovine species other than eligible ewe', which will apply to the premiums to be paid in respect of future  marketing years.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to premiums paid in respect of the 1991 marketing year and subsequent marketing years.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 1990.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nV.
