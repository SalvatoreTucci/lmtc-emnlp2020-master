whereas the quota volumes are as follows:\n- 173 000 tonnes of tomatoes falling within CN codes 0702 00 10 or 0702 00 90,\n- 28 663 tonnes of cucumbers falling within CN codes 0707 00 11 or 0707 00 19,\n- 3 819 tonnes of aubergines falling within CN code 0709 30 00;\nWhereas, for 1989, the duties applicable within the limits of those tariff quotas are equal to 50 % of the basic duties;\nwhereas, however, the products concerned qualify for exemption from import duties on import into that part of Spain which is included in the customs territory of the Community; whereas, where the said products are imported into Portugal, the quota  duties applicable are to be calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act of Accession; whereas to qualify for the tariff quota the products in question must comply with certain marking and labelling conditions designed to prove their  origin;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are  exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, allocation of the Community tariff quotas among the Member States would seem such as to preserve the Community nature of the quotas; whereas in order to correspond as closely as possible to the real  trend of the market for the products concerned the allocation should reflect the requirements of the Member States based on statistics of imports of those products originating in the Canary Islands during a representative reference period and on the  economic outlook for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, for 1989, it is necessary to maintain the shares for the Member States given that the administrations of the Member States cannot create, by 1989 a technical and administrative basis for Community administration of the quota; whereas, however,  it is possible, given the evolution of trade over the last few years, to provide for an increase in the Community reserve;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports of these products into each of the Member States were as follows:\n(tonnes) Member State CN codes 0702 00 10, 0702 00 90 Tomatoes CN codes 0707 00 11, 0707 00 19 Cucumbers CN code 0709 30 00 Aubergines 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 Benelux 75 188 57 041  55 013  6 000 11 566 12 209 2 352 2 091 1 367 Denmark  3 605     59     257  1 987     45 -    57     2 - Germany 37 302  2 826   2 725  2 492    179    246 1 295   110    27 Greece - - - - - - - - - Spain 15 430 -   5 338      5 - -   174 -   142 France  7 770  1 944     312    345    211    829   454    40   133 Ireland     21     62      13      2      5      8 - - - Italy -      3      94 - - - - - - Portugal - - - - - - - - - United Kingdom 90 063 95 220 103 284 11 255 15 485 21 062 1 425 1 747 1 717 Whereas during the last three years these products were imported regularly only by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should  be allocated only to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports actually take place in the latter; whereas these allocation arrangements will ensure the  uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;\nWhereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, each quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States and the second as a reserve to cover any  subsequent requirements of those Member States which have used up their initial shares and any requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, an appropriate level  for the first part of the Community quotas would, in the present circumstances, be 60 % of each quota volume;\nWhereas, if during the quota period the Community reserve is almost totally used up, it is vital that Member States should return to that reserve all the unused part of their initial and where relevant, additional shares, to prevent part of the  Community tariff quota remaining unused in a Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated  to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.

If an importer gives notification of imminent imports of one of the products in question into another Member State which has not taken part in the initial allocation or has used up its initial share and which applies to take advantage of the  corresponding quota the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to these requirements to the extent that the available balance of the reserve so permits.\n5.  Without prejudice to Article 3, the amounts drawn in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be valid until the end of the period to which the quota applies.", "1.  Once at least 80 % of the reserve of the tariff quota as defined in Article 2 (3) is used up, the Commission shall notify the Member States.\n2.  It shall also, in this case, notify the Member States of the date from which shares drawn from the Community reserve must be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions:\nIf an importer submits in a Member State a declaration for release for free circulation including an application for preferential treatment for a product referred to under this Regulation, and if that declaration is accepted by the customs authorities,  the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission and draw from the reserve referred to in Article 2 (3) a quantity corresponding to these requirements.\nApplications to draw on the quota volume, showing the date of acceptance of the above declaration must be forwarded to the Commission without delay.\nWithdrawals shall be granted by the Commission on the basis of the date when the declaration for release for free circulation was accepted by the customs authorities of the Member State concerned, in so far as the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use up the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the reserve.\nIf the quantities applied for are greater than the available balance of the reserve the shall be allocated pro rata.
