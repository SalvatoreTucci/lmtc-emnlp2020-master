Such derogations are not to last more than three years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation.\n(3) A number of Member States authorities have asked, by letter, to be granted derogations under Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005.\n(4) It emerges from the information provided to Eurostat that the Member States\u2019 requests for derogations are due to the need for major adaptations to national statistical systems in order to comply in full with Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005. The compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector requires additional data sources, the development of new statistical tools, and the design and implementation of a production system that is capable of meeting short deadlines.
