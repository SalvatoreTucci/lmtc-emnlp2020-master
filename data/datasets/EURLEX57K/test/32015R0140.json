However, that limit is not justified by safety reasons. Article 5(7) should therefore be adapted.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EU) No 71/2014\u00a0(3) inserted an Article 9a into Regulation (EU) No 965/2012. Commission Regulation (EU) No 83/2014\u00a0(4) subsequently inserted a second Article 9a, which should actually have been numbered Article 9b. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty, that Article 9a as inserted by Regulation (EU) No 83/2014 should be replaced and correctly numbered.\n(6) For reasons of legal certainty, and to ensure coherence with the terms used in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, it is necessary, in certain languages, to correct certain terms used in Regulation (EU) No 965/2012.\n(7) Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are based on the opinion\u00a0(5) issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency in accordance with Article 17(2)(b) and Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n(b) in paragraph 5, point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) other aeroplanes and helicopters as well as balloons and sailplanes in accordance with the provisions specified in Annex VII.\u2019\n(c) in paragraph 7, the second sentence is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 6 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 2, the first sentence is replaced by the following:\n(b) in paragraph 4a, the introductory wording is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 9a as inserted by Regulation (EU) No 83/2014 is replaced by the following:\n(a) duties of more than 13 hours at the most favourable times of the day;\n(b) duties of more than 10 hours at less favourable times of the day;\n(c) duties of more than 11 hours for crew members in an unknown state of acclimatisation;\n(d) duties including a high level of sectors (more than 6);\n(e) on-call duties such as standby or reserve followed by flight duties; and\n(f) disruptive schedules.\u2019\n(4) Annexes I, III, IV, VI and VIII are amended in accordance with the Annex I to this Regulation.", "Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 is corrected as follows:\n(1) Article 6(7) is replaced by the following:\n(2) Annexes II, III, IV, VII and VIII are corrected as set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever point (3) of Article 1 shall apply from 18 February 2016.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a079, 19.3.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to air operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0296, 25.10.2012, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 71/2014 of 27 January 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to Air Operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a023, 28.1.2014, p.\u00a027).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 83/2014 of 29 January 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to air operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a028, 31.1.2014, p.\u00a017).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0European Aviation Safety Agency Opinion No 05/2013 of 10 June 2013 for a Commission Regulation establishing the Implementing Rules for sterile flight deck procedures.\nANNEX I\nAnnexes I, III, IV, VI and VIII to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 are amended as follows:\n(1) In Annex I the following point (109a) is inserted:\n\u2018(109a) \u201cSterile flight crew compartment\u201d means any period of time when the flight crew members are not disturbed or distracted, except for matters critical to the safe operation of the aircraft or the safety of the occupants;\u2019\n(2) In Annex III (PART-ORO):\n(a) in ORO.GEN.110, point (f) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(f) The operator shall establish procedures and instructions for the safe operation of each aircraft type, containing ground staff and crew member duties and responsibilities, for all types of operation on the ground and in flight.
