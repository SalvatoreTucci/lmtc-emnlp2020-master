Nevertheless, a derogation should be provided for casings and fishery products except crustaceans, which are caught, frozen and packed in their final packaging at sea and landed directly on Community territory, such products not being concerned by the risk identified above.\n(8) Also, with a view to minimize negative trade effects in a manner proportionate to the management of the risk, this Decision authorizes the imports into the Community, during a period of 6 weeks, of consignments which have left China before the entry into force of this Decision, on condition that they are subjected to intensified monitoring and testing to ensure their safety.\n(9) This Decision shall be reviewed in the light of information provided by the competent authorities of China, any results from the increased monitoring and testing carried out by Member States on consignments arriving before 14 March 2002 and, if necessary, on the basis of the results of a new inspection visit carried out on the spot by Community experts.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["This Decision shall apply to all products of animal origin imported from China and intended for human consumption or animal feed use.", "1.
