Under the terms of that framework mandate, the Agency was requested to revise the TSI on operation and traffic management.\n(3) Appendix A of the current TSIs on Operation and Traffic Management refer to version 2 of the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) operating rules that were developed on the basis of the European Train Control System (ETCS) System Requirements Specifications (SRS) version 2.3.0.d.\n(4) The current versions of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications are \u2018Baseline 2\u2019 and \u2018Baseline 3\u2019. The version of the \u2018ERTMS operational principles and rules\u2019 corresponding to \u2018ERTMS/ETCS Baseline 3\u2019 is version 3. This needs to be reflected in the TSIs on operation and traffic management.\n(5) On 5 July 2012, the Agency issued a recommendation (ERA/REC/05-2012/INT-ERTMS) to update the version of the \u2018ERTMS operational principles and rules\u2019 referred to in Commission Decision 2012/757/EU of 14 November 2012 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the \u2018operation and traffic management\u2019 subsystem of the rail system in the European Union and amending Decision 2007/756/EC\u00a0(5).\n(6) Decision 2012/757/EU therefore needs to be amended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["Appendix A to Annex I to Decision 2012/757/EU (OPE TSI) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Appendix A\nERTMS/ETCS and ERTMS/GSM-R operating rules\nThe operating rules for ERTMS/ETCS and ERTMS/GSM-R are specified in the Technical Document \u201cERTMS operational principles and rules \u2014 version 3\u201d published on the ERA website (www.era.europa.eu).\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nSiim KALLAS\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 18.7.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 164, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 110, 20.4.2001, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 345, 15.12.2012, p. 1."}
