The vessels will be geared ones of maximum length 610', with maximum draft of 35', even keel salt water so that each vessel, after  requisite lighterage at Chittagong outer anchorage could, at the receiver's option, either take berth at Chittagong port and, after discharging requisite quantities and attaining permissible draft, sail to Chalna for completion of discharging, or  directly to Chalna for completion of discharging. A maximum of 40 % of each vessel's cargo may be discharged at Chalna at the receiver's option. Minimum of five hooks/hatch. Fully geared with a minimum of 10 tonnes lifting capacity on even hatch. Vessel  to be fitted with suitable fenders, such fenders being for owner's/disponent owner's account.\n3.

Vessels will provide winchmen at loading and discharging ports at their own expense.\n4. Vessels ETA information\nMaster to wireless/cable nominees of the recipient MOVEMENTS CHITTAGONG (simultaneously informing BANGLASHIP CHITTAGONG and MOVESTORE DHAKA) for orders regarding discharge 10 days prior to their arrival at the first discharge port, i.e. Chittagong, and  state ETA and draft.

At Chittagong and Chalna laytime will commence to count 24 hours after Notice of Readiness tendered and accepted during office hours, whether the vessel is in berth or not. At the  discharge port(s), time of shifting from anchorage to berth, berth to berth, and port to port not to count as laytime and expenses will be on owner's account.\nIf any trimming is required after lighterage at the Chittagong outer anchorage/discharging and Chittagong jetty/silo berth for safe passage to Chalna, it will be on account of the owners, receivers providing only empty gunny bags and owners providing  requisite thread for such trimming. Time required for trimming is not to count as laytime. Master to give direction for trimming. Discharge at anchorage to be affected with master's approval.\nAt Chittagong, outer anchorage and/or at Chalna anchorage, time lost due to cast off of mother vessel with lighter because of swell, not to count as laytime.\n7. Lighterage at discharge port\nIf the vessels arrive at Chittagong and are unable to enter and take jetty/silo berth there due to excess arrival draft, the recipient will undertake lighterage of the requisite quantity of cargo at the Chittagong outer anchorage at his own cost for  attaining permissible draft.\nAfter further discharging at Chittagong jetty/silo berth, on attaining the permissable draft for Chalna, subject to the limit of maximum of 40 % of each vessel's cargo for discharging at Chalna, at the receiver's option, the vessel will then proceed to  Chalna for completion of discharging. Subject to the limit of maximum of 40 % of each vessel's cargo for discharging at Chalna, at receiver's option, after lighterage at Chittagong outer anchorage, if permissable draft is attained, the vessel may  proceed directly to Chalna for completion of discharging. If the vessels arrive with deeper draft than available at the Chittagong outer anchorage, lightening will be carried out at Kutubdia and the vesels to proceed from there to Chittagong outer  anchorage as soon as permissable draft is attained. The cost and time for the quantity lightened, including trimming, if any, at Kutubdia, will be on the owner's account.
