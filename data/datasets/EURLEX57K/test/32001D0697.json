Spain acting as nominated rapporteur Member State, submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the Commission 30 November 1998.\n(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the applicant Cyanamid as provided for in Article 6(4) of the Directive.\n(6) The assessment report prepared by Spain has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 27 April 2001 in the format of a Commission review report for chlorfenapyr.\n(7) Assessments made on the basis of information submitted raised further questions particularly with regard to the fate and behaviour of the substance in the environment.\n(8) The applicant informed the Commission and the rapporteur Member State that it no longer wished to participate in the programme of work for this active substance, and therefore no further information will be submitted.\n(9) Therefore, it is not possible to include this active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(10) A period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing chlorfenapyr is not necessary for this active substance as only Belgium had granted a provisional authorisation for this active substance. Belgium has indicated that this authorisation has now expired and the active substance was never effectively placed on the market in Belgium.\n(11) This decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC(4).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Chlorfenapyr is not included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that from the date of adoption of the present Decision no provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing chlorfenapyr are granted as provided for in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 September 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 176, 29.6.2001, p. 61.\n(3) OJ L 220, 30.8.1996, p. 21.\n(4) OJ L 33, 8.2.1979, p. 36."}
