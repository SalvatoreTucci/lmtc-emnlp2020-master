General purpose\nTo improve facilities for fishery products particularly the supply of ice at fishing ports in Ireland.\n2. Area covered\nThe entire coastline of Ireland.\n3. Duration\nThe programme covers the period January 1989 to December 1992.\n4. Objectives and investment forecast\nThe objectives of this programme are the modernization and equipping of the main fishing ports in order to improve the production, landing and selling conditions of fishery products.\nThe total investment required during the programme to attain the objectives is \u00a3Irl 7 410 000 or ECU 9 700 000 (1) broken down as follows:\n1.2.3 //  //  //  // Investments  // (\u00a3Irl million)   // (ECU million)   //    //   //   // Investments eligible under Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 (auction halls)   // 2,440  // 3,196   // Ice supplies   // 3,420   // 4,480  // Refrigerated storage   // 0,030   // 0,039   // Fuel supplies/water supplies   // 0,295   // 0,387   // Fish landing equipment   // 0,095   // 0,125   // Back up facilities for fishing vessels   // 1,100   // 1,442   // Safety measures  // 0,030   // 0,039   //    //   //   // Total  // 7,410  // 9,708   //    //   //\nThese figures and the breakdown between the various types of investment are indicative.\nThe projects which are not eligible under the Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and its application Regulation (EEC) No 2321/88 (2), may be eligible under other Regulations. They are included to give an overall view of the improvements. Thus once projects are submitted for Community aid under this Regulation, it is for the Commission to examine them and decide whether or not they are eligible.\n(1) 1 ECU = \u00a3Irl 0,764 (3. 4. 1990).\n(2) OJ No L 202, 27. 7. 1988, p. 18.\nANNEX II\nOBSERVATIONS\nThe Commission finds that the programme presented by the Government of Ireland as a framework for future Community of national financial assistance represents an appropriate basis for promoting the development of facilities at fishing ports and also for the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nThe Commission points out that the development of facilities at fishing ports, for the processing and marketing of fishery products must be consistent with the probable trend of fishery resources and with the impact and objectives of multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleet and aquaculture sectors.\nThe Commission underlines the necessity to comply with the Community rules on public supply and work contracts in the projects and programmes financed through the Structural Funds and Community financial instruments (1).\nUntil 30 June 1991, projects for the provision of facilities at fishing ports submitted under Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and outside the framework of the sectorial plan will be examined for the purpose of granting aid under the present programme.\n(1) Council Directive 71/305/EEC (OJ No L 185, 16. 8. 1971, p. 5)."}
