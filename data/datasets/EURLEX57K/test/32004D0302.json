It will be deducted from the Community contribution.\n(3) According to Article 9(4) of that Regulation, Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(2) apply to the Community financing for establishing the register.\n(4) Greece has sent the Commission, by letters of 15 February 2001 and 3 November 2003, the documents needed to decide on the amount to be defrayed as expenditure incurred in establishing the register.\n(5) The Commission has carried out the inspections provided for in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.\n(6) Only expenditure incurred in preparing a usable register is eligible for a Community contribution. In the light of verifications made on the basis of the documents sent by Greece, the reference chart for the entire area under vines was not established on the territory of that Member State within the time limit set. The expenditure declared by Greece does not satisfy the requirements under the rules and may not be funded by the Community.\n(7) According to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86, the register is to be established in its entirety not later than six years following the date of entry into force of that Regulation. Article 4(4) of the Regulation, inserted by Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1549/95(3), provides that Member States which, on 1 July 1995, have not yet established a vineyard register or which have only established a partial register shall, before 31 December 1996, establish reference charts covering the entire area under vines.\n(8) The deadline for establishing the register in Greece was extended to 31 December 2000.\n(9) An assessment of the amount to be defrayed and the amount to be excluded on grounds of failure to comply with Community rules was sent to Greece on 9 August 2002.
