It is necessary for the time limit for the lodging of crop declarations by olive growers or by producer organisations and associations thereof for the 2000/01 marketing year to be postponed so that the Portuguese authorities can input the declarations into the GIS as they are lodged and deal immediately with any adjustments that are necessary. In view of the importance of the GIS for improving control operations, the time limits for lodging crop declarations for the 2000/01 marketing year in Portugal should therefore be postponed from 1 December 2000 to 31 January 2001 in the case of olive growers and from 1 January 2001 to 28 February 2001 in the case of producer organisations and associations thereof.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["By derogation from Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 olive growers in Portugal are hereby authorised to lodge crop declarations for their olive trees in production and the olive groves they manage as at 1 November of the marketing year in respect of which the declaration is made, no later than 31 January 2001 for the 2000/01 marketing year.", "By derogation from Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 producer organisations or, where appropriate, associations thereof in Portugal are hereby authorised to lodge members' crop declarations and any amendments thereto no later than 28 February 2001 for the 2000/01 marketing year.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 November 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 October 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.\n(2) OJ L 327, 21.12.1999, p. 7.\n(3) OJ L 210, 28.7.1998, p. 32.\n(4) OJ L 208, 3.8.1984, p. 3.\n(5) OJ L 210, 28.7.1998, p. 38.\n(6) OJ L 293, 31.10.1998, p. 50.\n(7) OJ L 151, 18.6.1999, p. 12."}
