In this context the next EU-wide stress tests of banks, to be conducted under the aegis of the European Banking Authority (EBA), will not take place in 2013 as previously expected.\n(4) In preparation for the SSM entry stress test and with a view to (i) having meaningful diagnostics before the programme ends and (ii) ensuring as much as possible consistency across different assessment exercises, Ireland should therefore carry out a series of preparatory steps, including a preliminary comprehensive balance sheet assessment, before the end of 2013.\n(5) Ireland has reaffirmed its commitment to transfer, without delay, the responsibility for the water sector from local authorities to a national public utility and to introduce water charges for households. Ireland has demonstrated good progress in carrying out the reform of its water sector, including with the enactment of legislation, the establishment of Irish Water and the completion of operational steps for the transition process. Technical reasons would justify deferring the introduction of water charges for households to 2014, without compromising the reform process as whole.\n(6) In light of those developments and considerations, Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU should be amended,", "main_body": ["Article 3, paragraph 10, of Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) complete a balance sheet assessment before the end of the programme, as part of the preparatory work towards a stress test to be conducted in accordance with the new EU methodology;\u2019;\n(2) the following point is added:\n\u2018(c) communicate to the Commission the funding model for Irish Water and announce a definitive time-plan for the introduction of domestic water charges in the fourth quarter of 2014.\u2019.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 July 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
