Accordingly, on 31 March 2011, Mayotte became the 101st French department and the fifth French overseas department.\n(4) The structural social and economic situation and the geographical situation of Mayotte present all the characteristics, referred to in Article 349 TFEU, of an outermost region within the meaning of that provision. References to Mayotte should therefore be inserted into Article 349, making the whole of that Article applicable to Mayotte, and into Article 355(1) TFEU.\n(5) The amendment of the status with regard to the European Union of Mayotte, in response to a democratically expressed request, should represent a step consistent with Mayotte\u2019s acquisition of a status close to that of the mainland,", "main_body": ["With effect from 1 January 2014, Mayotte shall cease to be an overseas country or territory, to which the provisions of Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) apply, and shall become an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU.", "The TFEU shall be amended as follows:\n(1) in the first paragraph of Article 349, the word \u2018Mayotte\u2019 shall be inserted after the word \u2018Martinique\u2019;\n(2) in Article 355(1), the word \u2018Mayotte\u2019 shall be inserted after the word \u2018Martinique\u2019;\n(3) in Annex II, the sixth indent shall be deleted.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 July 2012.\nFor the European Council\nThe President\nH.
