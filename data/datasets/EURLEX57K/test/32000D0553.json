Member States may request tests to demonstrate such compliance if the products/materials are used in configurations not recognised as satisfying those national provisions(1).\nThe specific conditions set out in the table do not prevent the Member States from accepting the placing on the market and use, without testing, of the relevant products/materials under less stringent conditions.\nSymbols\nPCS: gross calorific value\nTABLE\nRoof covering products (and/or materials) which can be considered to fulfil all of the requirements for the performance characteristic \"external fire performance\" without the need for testing, subject to any national provisions on the design and execution of works being fulfilled\n>TABLE>\n(1) For example, it is known that some Member States require a non-combustible underlayer of a certain thickness to prevent direct contact of metal sheets with the supporting structure. Metal sheets in the following table that are intended to be used in these countries with other types of underlayer will require testing to demonstrate compliance with national provisions on the design and execution of works."}
