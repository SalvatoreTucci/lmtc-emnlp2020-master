At that time, only the area of Thionville in the northern part of Moselle was concerned by the disease. In this area the disease now appears to be fully under control.\n(2) By Commission Decision 2002/626/EC\u00a0(2), the plan submitted by France for the eradication of the classical swine fever in feral pigs in Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle was approved.\n(3) France put also in place an intensive programme to survey classical swine fever in feral pigs in the departments of Ardennes, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Moselle and Bas-Rhin, bordering Belgium, Germany and Luxemburg. That programme is still ongoing.\n(4) Classical swine fever was later also confirmed in feral pigs in Bas-Rhin and it spread to the north-eastern part of Moselle, in the area of the Northern Vosges. It was established that this second epidemic was caused by a different virus strain and evolved in a distinct manner from the one confirmed in the area of Thionville.\n(5) Accordingly, France has now submitted for approval a plan for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs in the area of the Northern Vosges. In addition, as that Member State intends to introduce vaccination of the feral pigs in that area, it has also submitted a plan for emergency vaccination for approval.\n(6) The French authorities have authorised the use of a live attenuated vaccine against classical swine fever (C strain) to be used for the immunisation of feral pigs by means of oral baits.\n(7) The plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the emergency vaccination of such pigs in the area of the Northern Vosges, as submitted by France, have been examined and found to comply with Directive 2001/89/EC.\n(8) For the sake of transparency it is appropriate to set out in this Decision the geographical areas where the eradication and emergency vaccination plans are to be implemented.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The plan submitted by France for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs in the area as set out in point 1 of the Annex is approved.", "The plan submitted by France for the emergency vaccination of feral pigs in the area as set out in point 2 of the Annex is approved.", "France shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
