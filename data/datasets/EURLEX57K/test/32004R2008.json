At the same time those provisions should be amended in such a way that subsidies of a nature to facilitate access to credits granted under other instruments are not taken into account in the application of those aid limits. As this would remove a possible ambiguity, that amendment should apply with retrospective effect for all beneficiary countries. It is however necessary to ensure that in all cases the ceilings laid down in the Europe Agreements are complied with.\n(3) The aid intensity limits in hill and mountain regions of Bulgaria and Romania should be aligned from 1 January 2004 on those in less-favoured areas of countries that acceded to the Union on 1 May 2004, for investments in agricultural holdings and for young farmers, as provided for in Article 331(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.\n(4) The aid intensities and the proportion of the Community contribution in total eligible public expenditure for rural development measures involving infrastructure and certain other measures in beneficiary countries which are not acceding to the Union in 2004, namely Bulgaria and Romania, should be aligned on those in countries that acceded to the Union on 1 May 2004.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, the following indent shall be added:\n\u2018\u2014 with regard to Bulgaria and Romania, preparation of rural communities to conceive and implement local rural development strategies, and integrated territorial rural development strategies of a pilot nature, within the limits set by Article 33f of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)\u00a0(5).\n2.
