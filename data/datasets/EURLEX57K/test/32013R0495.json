Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health in the Union and therefore Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 of 25 March 2011 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station\u00a0(2) was adopted. That Regulation was later replaced by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 961/2011\u00a0(3), Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 284/2012\u00a0(4) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012\u00a0(5).\n(3) Article 17 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012 provides for a review of the provisions when the results of sampling and analysis on the presence of radioactivity of feed and food of the third growing season after the accident will be available, i.e. by 31 March 2014. However, in accordance with that Article, the provisions concerning the products for which the harvest is mainly in the second part of the second growing season and therefore all the data of the second growing season are not yet available, should be reviewed by 31 March 2013.\n(4) The measures have been reviewed taking into account the occurrence data on radioactivity in feed and food provided by the Japanese authorities for the period between September 2012 and January 2013.\n(5) As regards the prefectures of Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Iwate, Chiba and Kanagawa, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012 requires to sample and analyse, before export to the Union, mushrooms, tea, fishery products, certain edible wild plants, certain vegetables, certain fruits, rice and soybeans and the processed and derived products thereof. Following the detailed assessment of the data provided, pears, taro, yacon, pome fruit, pawpaw and scallops should be removed from the list of products for which sampling and analysis are required before export while buckwheat, lotus root and threeleaf arrowroot should be included in that list. Given that the import of fresh bovine meat from Japan has been recently allowed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 196/2013 of 7 March 2013 amending Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as regards the new entry for Japan in the list of third countries or parts thereof from which imports into the European Union of certain fresh meat are authorised\u00a0(6), it is necessary to add fresh bovine meat to the list of products for which sampling and analysis are required before export.\n(6) Following findings of non-compliance, it is appropriate to add the requirement for sampling and analysis before export for mushrooms from the prefectures Nagano, Niigata and Aomori.\n(7) Therefore Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 5, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the product has been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011; or\n(b) the product, other than tea and mushrooms originating in the prefecture Shizuoka and other than mushrooms originating in the prefectures Yamanashi, Nagano, Niigata or Aomori, originates in and is consigned from a prefecture other than Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Iwate; or\n(c) the product originates in and is consigned from Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Iwate but is not listed in Annex IV to this Regulation (and consequently no analysis before export is required); or\n(d) the product is consigned from Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Iwate prefectures, but does not originate in one of those prefectures and has not been exposed to radioactivity during transiting; or\n(e) where the product is tea or mushrooms originating in Shizuoka prefecture or mushrooms originating in Yamanashi, Nagano, Niigata or Aomori prefecture, or a derived product thereof or a compound feed or food containing more than 50\u00a0% of these products, the product is accompanied by an analytical report containing the results of sampling and analysis; or\n(f) where the product, listed in Annex IV to this Regulation, originates in Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Iwate prefectures, or is a compound feed or food containing more than 50\u00a0% of these products, the product is accompanied by an analytical report containing the results of sampling and analysis. The list of products in Annex IV is without prejudice to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients\u00a0(7); or\n(g) where the origin of the product or of the ingredients present at more than 50\u00a0% is unknown, the product is accompanied by an analytical report containing the results of sampling and analysis.\n(2) Article 16 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the products left Japan before the entry into force of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012; or\n(b) the products are accompanied by a declaration in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 284/2012 which was issued before 1 November 2012 and the products have left Japan before 1 December 2012.\n(a) the products left Japan before the entry into force of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 495/2013\u00a0(8); or\n(b) the products are accompanied by a declaration in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 996/2012 which was issued before 1 June 2013 and the products have left Japan before 1 July 2013.\n(3) Annex I is replaced by the text set out in Annex I to this
