The ECB is required to carry out such an assessment at least in relation to the credit institutions not covered by Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(2) On 23 October 2013, the ECB published the names of institutions included in the comprehensive assessment as well as an initial overview of the key features of the comprehensive assessment.\n(3) Based on the criteria referred to in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, the ECB has identified credit institutions in respect of which it intends to carry out a comprehensive assessment, including a balance-sheet assessment, in accordance with Article 33(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013. In applying the above criteria, the ECB has taken into account possible changes that may occur at any time owing to the dynamics of the activities of credit institutions and the resulting consequences for the total value of their assets. As a result, it has included credit institutions that currently do not meet the criteria for significance but may do so in the near future and should be subject therefore to the comprehensive assessment. The ECB will therefore undertake a comprehensive assessment with respect to credit institutions, financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies the total value of whose assets exceeds EUR 27\u00a0billion. Notwithstanding the above criteria, the ECB will also undertake the comprehensive assessment with respect to the three most significant institutions in each of the euro area Member States. The identification of credit institutions on which the ECB intends to carry out comprehensive assessments is without prejudice to the final assessment of the criteria that is based on the specific methodology included in the framework referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(4) The credit institutions and the national competent authorities are required to supply all relevant information for the ECB to carry out the comprehensive assessment in accordance with Article 33(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(5) The ECB may require the national competent authorities and the persons referred to in Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 to provide all relevant information for the ECB to carry out such a comprehensive assessment.\n(6) Members of the Supervisory Board, staff of the ECB and staff seconded by participating Member States are subject to professional secrecy requirements set out in Article 37 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank and relevant Union law. In particular, the ECB and national competent authorities are subject to the provisions regarding the exchange of information and professional secrecy set out in Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Entities subject to the comprehensive assessment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The entities listed in the Annex shall be subject to the comprehensive assessment to be carried out by the ECB by 3 November 2014.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article 33(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, the national competent authority responsible for the supervision of a credit institution listed in the Annex shall submit all information of relevance to the comprehensive assessment that the ECB requests in relation to that credit institution.
