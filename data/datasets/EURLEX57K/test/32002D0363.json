At national level that measure has been extended to cover occasional passenger transport.\n(4) By letter dated 18 April 2001 (published in OJ C 160, 2.6.2001), the Commission notified France of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in connection with the abovementioned measures.\n(5) For environmental and energy-conservation reasons, France adopted taxes on diesel oil that were much higher than the Community minimum. The increase in the tax burden, not to mention the very high increase in the price of crude oil, has had extremely negative repercussions on the activities of the road transport sector. In these circumstances, France has been compelled to introduce compensatory measures to meet the considerable economic and social difficulties to which the sector is prey, no other remedy being sufficient.\n(6) The measure is not discriminatory as it is open to all firms established within the Community that obtain diesel fuel in France. Even when account is taken of this reimbursement arrangement, the TIPP rate in France is still much higher than the Community minimum rate for diesel fuel. The fact that some firms or sectors benefit from certain tax measures does not in itself mean that they are in form or substance contrary to the common interest.\n(7) The arrangement is temporary. It will cease to apply on 31 December 2002. In 2002 the annual reimbursement will be substantially reduced compared with the figure for 2001.\n(8) There are therefore exceptional circumstances that make it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the economic and social difficulties of the transporters concerned, compatible with the common market,", "main_body": ["The measures adopted by France in accordance with the second indent of Article 3(3) of Decision 1999/880/EC and with Article 2 of Decision 2001/224/EC shall be considered compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
