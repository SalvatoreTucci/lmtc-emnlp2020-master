Considering that the legal situation and the facts which justified the extension until 31 December 2006 have not changed and that to avoid a temporary gap in the value added tax arrangements for radio and television broadcasting services and certain electronically supplied services, those arrangements should continue to apply until 31 December 2008.\n(3) Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, which has recast Directive 77/388/EEC, should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Given the urgency of the matter, in order to avoid a legal gap, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,", "main_body": ["Directive 2006/112/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 56, paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 57, paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n3. in Article 59, paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n4.
