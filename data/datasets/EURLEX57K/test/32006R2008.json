For the sake of harmonisation, imports under the quotas of \u2018baby beef\u2019 originating in Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should also be made subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia or with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively. A model should also be established for the certificates of authenticity and detailed rules laid down for their use.\n(5) Kosovo, as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, is subject to an international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and Montenegro have also set up a separate customs service. There should therefore also be a specific certificate of authenticity for goods originating in the customs territories of Montenegro or Kosovo.\n(6) The quotas concerned should be managed through the use of import licences. To this end, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(7) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(8), should be applicable subject to this Regulation.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(9) applies to import licences for import tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed provisions on applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down in this Regulation. It is necessary to align the provisions of this Regulation on Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 where appropriate.\n(8) In order to ensure proper management of imports of the products concerned, import licences should be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following tariff quotas are hereby opened for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2007:\n(a) 9\u00a0400 tonnes of \u2018baby beef\u2019, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Croatia;\n(b) 1\u00a0500 tonnes of \u2018baby beef\u2019, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(c) 1\u00a0650 tonnes of \u2018baby beef\u2019, expressed in carcass weight, originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;\n(d) 9\u00a0975 tonnes of \u2018baby beef\u2019, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.\nThe quotas referred to in the first subparagraph shall bear the order Nos 09.4503, 09.4504, 09.4505 and 09.4506 respectively.\nFor the purposes of attributing those quotas, 100 kilograms live weight shall be equivalent to 50 kilograms carcass weight.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customs duty applicable under the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 20\u00a0% of the ad valorem duty and 20\u00a0% of the specific duty as laid down in the Common Customs Tariff.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importation under the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reserved for certain live animals and certain meat falling within the following CN codes, referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded with Croatia and in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia:\n\u2014 ex\u00a00102\u00a090\u00a051, ex\u00a00102\u00a090\u00a059, ex\u00a00102\u00a090\u00a071 and ex\u00a00102\u00a090\u00a079,\n\u2014 ex\u00a00201\u00a010\u00a000 and ex\u00a00201\u00a020\u00a020,\n\u2014 ex\u00a00201\u00a020\u00a030,\n\u2014 ex\u00a00201\u00a020\u00a050.", "Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.
