In addition, third States may also provide such information.\n(7) The respective roles of the Council, the HR, the GSA as operator of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (\u2018GSMC\u2019) and the Member States should be clarified within the chain of operational responsibilities to be set up in order to react to a threat to the Union, to the Member States or to the GNSS.\n(8) In this regard, the basic references to threats are contained in the System-Specific Security Requirement Statement which contains the main generic threats to be handled by the GNSS as a whole, and the System Security Plan which includes the security risk register set up in the security accreditation process. These will serve as references to identify the threats specifically to be dealt with by this Decision and to complete the operational procedures for the implementation of this Decision.\n(9) Decisions in cases of urgency may have to be taken within very few hours of the arrival of the information concerning the threat.\n(10) In the event that the circumstances do not allow for the Council to take a decision to avert a threat or to mitigate serious harm to the essential interests of the Union or of one or more of its Member States, the HR should be empowered to take the necessary provisional measures.\n(11) Regulation (EU) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(2) and Regulation (EU) No\u00a01285/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) modified the governance of the European GNSS. In particular, Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013 provides that the GSA is to ensure the operation of the GSMC.\n(12) Regulation (EU) No 512/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) assigns to the GSA Executive Director the responsibility to ensure that the GSA, as the operator of the GSMC is able to respond to instructions provided under Joint Action 2004/552/CFSP, as replaced by this Decision. In addition, Decision No\u00a01104/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) lays down the rules under which the Member States, the Council, the Commission, the European External Action Service, Union agencies, third States and international organisations may access the public regulated service (\u2018PRS\u2019) provided by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme. In particular, Article 6 of Decision 1104/2011/EU defines the GSMC as the operational interface between the competent PRS authorities, the Council and the HR and the control centres,", "main_body": ["This Decision sets out the responsibilities to be exercised by the Council and the HR to avert a threat to the security of the Union or one or more Member States or to mitigate serious harm to the essential interests of the Union or of one or more Member States arising from the deployment, operation or use of the European Global Navigation Satellite System, in particular as a result of an international situation requiring action by the Union or in the event of a threat to the operation of the system itself or its services.", "In the event of such a threat, the Member States, the Commission or the GSA, as appropriate, shall immediately inform the Council and the HR of all the elements at their disposal which they consider relevant.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Council, acting unanimously upon a proposal from the HR, shall decide on the necessary instructions to the GSA.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The GSA and the Commission shall provide advice to the Council on the likely wider impact on the GNSS of any instructions which it intends to issue.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Political and Security Committee (\u2018PSC\u2019) shall provide an opinion to the Council on any instructions proposed, as appropriate.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the urgency of the situation requires immediate action to be taken before the Council has taken a decision under Article 3(1), the HR is authorised to issue the necessary provisional instructions to the GSA.
