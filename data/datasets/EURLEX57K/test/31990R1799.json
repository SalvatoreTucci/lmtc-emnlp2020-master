whereas the Community decided, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 714/90 of 5 March 1990 concerning the application of Decision No 2/90 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on transitional measures valid from 1 March 1990 (1), to apply Protocol 6 annexed to the Convention autonomously in advance;\nWhereas Protocol 6 provides that products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States which fall within CN codes 2208 40 10, 2208 40 90, 2208 90 11 and 2208 90 19 shall, until the entry into force of a common organization of the market in spirits, be allowed into the Community free of customs duties under conditions such as to permit the development of traditional trade flows between the ACP States and the Community and between the Member States; whereas the Community shall until 31 December 1993 fix each year the quantities which may be imported free of customs duties on the basis of the largest quantities imported annually from the ACP States into the Community in the past three years for which statistics are available, increased by an annual growth rate of 37 % on the market of the United Kingdom and 27 % on the other markets of the Community; and whereas the volume of the annual quantity can in no case be less than 172 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol;\nWhereas by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of Decision No 2/87 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on the advance implementation of the Protocol to the Third ACP-EEC Convention consequent on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities (2), provision is made for special arrangements for the quota dutes to be applied by those two Member States; whereas by reason of the particularities peculiar to the market in rum the quota period ranges from 1 July to 30 June;\nWhereas, having regard to the levels reached by imports of the products concerned into the Community during the past three years for which statistics are available, the annual quota volume for the period from 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991 must be fixed at 193 668 hectolitres of pure alcohol;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up;\nWhereas, following the case law of the Court of Justice, it is unlawful to allocate the Community quotas between the Member States, unless overriding circumstances of an administrative, technical or economic nature, prevent acting otherwise; whereas, in addition, in cases where it is decided to allocate quotas, a mechanism should be set up whereby the integrity of the Common Customs Tariff may be protected;\nWhereas the economic difficulties which could result for the French Overseas Departments (FOD) from the sudden change in the arrangements for importing rum from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States constitute circumstances having a binding effect which justify the temporary and partial maintenance of these arrangements; whereas, however, the arrangements for allocation of the quota into national shares should be phased out and can only be justified on a transitional basis; whereas the arrangements should in any event definitively disappear with the prospect of the establishment of the internal market;\nWhereas, in these circumstances, it is advisable to increase to 40 % the volume of the Community reserve by means of a system for the automatic transfer of Member State share to the reserve as soon as 80 % of the latter has been used up;\nWhereas, during the past three years for which statistical data are available, imports from Member States have been as follows:\n(in hectolitres of pure alcohol)\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member State  // 1987   // 1988  // 1989   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 6 264   // 7 389   // 7 621   // Denmark   // 1 884   // 2 038   // 1 748  // Germany   // 33 570   // 42 523   // 48 591   // Greece  // 50   // -   // 586   // Spain   // 244   // -   // 156  // France   // 1 929   // 1 216   // 19   // Ireland   // 2 060   // 2 989   // 2 973   // Italy   // 800   // 806   // 431   // Portugal   // 7   // -   // -   // United Kingdom   // 72 040   // 63 525   // 83 773   //    //   //   //   // Total 1987, p. 1.\nWhereas, in view of these factors, of market forecasts for the products in question and of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:\nBenelux 5,53,\nDenmark 1,47,\nGermany 32,43,\nGreece 0,17,\nSpain 0,10,\nFrance 0,83\nIreland 1,88,\nItaly 0,53,\nPortugal 0,00,\nUnited Kingdom 57,06;\nWhereas provision should be made for a mechanism to prevent, when the Community quota is not exhausted, goods from being imported into a Member State which has exhausted its share only after the full application of customs duties, or after having been diverted to another Member State which has not yet exhausted its share; whereas, in these circumstances, if, during the quota period, the Community reserve were to be almost entirely used up, Member States should return to the said reserve all of the unused portion of their initial shares so as to avoid part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State, when it could be used in others;\nWhereas measures should be laid down to ensure that Protocol 5 is implemented under conditions such as to permit the development of traditional trade flows between the ACP States and the Community, on the one hand, and between the Member States on the other;\nWhereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be able to keep account of quota utilization rates and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quotas may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
