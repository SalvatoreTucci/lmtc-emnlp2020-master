Those centres are unable to handle all declarations by the deadline.\n(4) In order to rectify these two different situations, which are outside producers\u2019 control, and therefore to avoid producers incurring unjustified penalties, they should be granted an extension for the submission of harvest and production declarations and the Member States should be allowed to extend this time frame to a final deadline.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001, for the 2008/09 wine year the declarations referred to in Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation may be submitted up to 31 December 2008.
