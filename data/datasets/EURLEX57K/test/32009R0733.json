Community market prices for dairy products have fallen significantly. As a result of a combination of market measures taken since the beginning of this year community prices have stabilised around support price levels. It is essential that these market support measures, notably public intervention, continue to apply as long as necessary for avoiding further deterioration of prices and disturbance of the community market.\n(2) In view of the current and foreseeable market situation it is necessary to continue public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder beyond 31 August 2009.\n(3) The Commission made a proposal for a Council Regulation on an extension for 2009 and 2010 of the period for public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder as provided for in Article 11(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, which was welcomed by the Council.\n(4) In view of the urgency by which measures have to be taken since the intervention period ends on 31 August 2009 and the practical problem that, following the recent elections, the European Parliament is not likely to be in a position to deliver an opinion in due time, the Commission has to adopt the necessary emergency measures.\n(5) Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 105/2008\u00a0(2) lays down rules to be followed when the Commission decides that the buying-in of butter is to take place under a tendering procedure.\n(6) Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2001\u00a0(3) lays down rules to be followed when the Commission decides that the buying-in of skimmed milk powder is to take place under a tendering procedure.\n(7) In view of the special situation on the dairy market and in order that the system is more efficient, it is appropriate to increase, by way of derogation from Regulations (EC) No 214/2001 and (EC) No 105/2008, the frequency of the tenders to twice a month.\n(8) For reasons of effectiveness, this Regulation provides all the necessary information for operators and thus makes a separate notice to tender redundant. In order to guarantee for the operators the most up-to-date information on contact details of the paying agencies, it is appropriate to publish this information by other more effective means of communication than the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(9) The extension of the intervention period should apply only for a limited period of three months \u2014 from 1 September until 30 November 2009.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Buying-in of butter by a tendering procedure is open from 1 September 2009 until 30 November 2009, under the conditions provided for in Section 3 of Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 105/2008 and in this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 105/2008, the time limit for the submission of tenders in response to the individual invitations to tender shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on the first and third Tuesday of the month.\nIf Tuesday is a public holiday the time limit shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on the previous working day.\nThe time limit for submission of tenders for the first individual invitation to tender shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on 1 September 2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 105/2008 no notice of invitation to tender will be published\u00a0(4).\nCHAPTER II\nSKIMMED MILK POWDER", "Buying-in of skimmed milk powder by a tendering procedure is open from 1 September 2009 until 30 November 2009, under the conditions provided for in Section 4 of Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 and in this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 214/2001, the time limit for the submission of tenders in response to the individual invitations to tender shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on the first and third Tuesday of the month.\nIf Tuesday is a public holiday the time limit shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on the previous working day.\nThe time limit for submission of tenders for the first individual invitation to tender shall be 11.00 (Brussels time) on 1\u00a0September 2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 214/2001 no notice of invitation to tender will be published\u00a0(4).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 August 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a032, 6.2.2008, p.\u00a03.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a037, 7.2.2001, p.\u00a0100.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The relevant addresses of the paying agencies are available on the European Commission website CIRCA (http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/agri/lait/library)."}
