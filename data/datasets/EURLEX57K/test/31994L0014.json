Defatting\nSamples containing more than 5 % fats must be defatted with light petroleum (bp 40 to 60 \u00b0C) after the preparations indicated in 5.1.\nIn such cases, the analytical results must be expressed in terms of the weight of the non-defatted sample.\n2. Reproducibility of the results for Method A\nThe reproducibility of the results, i.e. the variation between the results obtained by two or more laboratories on the same sample has been estimated at:\n\u00b1 50 % of the mean value for mean values of aflatoxin B, from 10 and up to 20 mg/kg;\n\u00b1 10 mg/kg on the mean value for mean values greater than 20 and up to 50 mg/kg;\n\u00b1 20 % of the mean value for mean values above 50 mg/kg.'"}
