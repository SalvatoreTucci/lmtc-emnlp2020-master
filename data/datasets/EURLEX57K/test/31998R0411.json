CUNNINGHAM\n(1) OJ L 340, 11. 12. 1991, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Directive 95/29/EC (OJ L 148, 30. 6. 1995, p. 52).\nANNEX\nADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR ROAD VEHICLES USED FOR CARRIAGE OF LIVESTOCK ON JOURNEYS EXCEEDING EIGHT HOURS\n1. BEDDING\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Chapter I(A)(5), second sentence, of the Annex to Directive 91/628/EEC, animals must be provided with appropriate bedding material which:\n(a) guarantees their comfort; the quantity may vary depending on\n- the species and the number of the animals being transported,\n- the journey time,\n- the weather;\n(b) ensures adequate absorption and dispersal of animal urine and dung.\n2. FEED\nWhere, because of the species and categories of animals being transported and the journey times set out in Chapter VII(4) of the Annex to Directive 91/628/EEC, the animals must be fed during the journey, the following provisions apply:\n(a) the vehicle used for the journey must carry a sufficient quantity of appropriate feedingstuff for the feeding requirements of the animals in question during the journey concerned;\n(b) during the journey, the feedingstuffs must be protected from the weather and from contaminants such as, in particular, dust, fuel, exhaust gases and animal urine and dung;\n(c) where specific equipment (troughs, receptacles or any other appropriate means of distributing feedingstuffs) must be used for the feeding of animals, that equipment must be transported in the vehicle, be suitable for the purpose and be cleaned before and after use and disinfected after each journey;\n(d) where feeding equipment such as described above is used, it must be so designed that it does not injure the animals and can, if necessary, be attached to a specific part of the vehicle to prevent its being overturned. When the vehicle is moving and when the equipment is not in use, it must be stored in a part of the vehicle separate from the animals.\n3. ACCESS\nVehicles used for transport must be equipped so that at all times there can be direct access to all the animals being transported so that they can be inspected and given all appropriate care, including feeding and watering in particular.\n4. VENTILATION\nThe vehicle must be equipped with an adequate ventilation system to ensure that the welfare of the animals being transported is permanently guaranteed, taking into account in particular the following criteria:\n- the planned journey and its duration,\n- the design of the vehicle used (open or closed),\n- the inside temperature and the outside temperature resulting from atmospheric conditions which may occur during the planned journey,\n- the specific physiological needs of the various species transported,\n- the loading densities provided for in Chapter VI of the Annex to Directive 91/628/EEC and the space available above the animals.\nThe system must also be designed in such a way that:\n- it can be used at any time when the animals are in the vehicle whether it is stationary or moving,\n- it ensures the efficient circulation of unpolluted air.\nTo that end, operators must provide:\n- either a forced ventilation system, the details of which are to be determined after consultation of the Scientific Veterinary Committee in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Directive 91/628/EEC,\n- or a ventilation system which ensures that a range of temperatures from 5 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C can be maintained within the vehicle for all animals, with a + 5 \u00b0C tolerance depending on the outside temperature. This system must also be equipped with an appropriate monitoring device.\nThe possibility of choosing between these two systems shall not prejudice the principle of the free movement of the animals.\n5. PARTITIONS\n5.1. The vehicle must be fitted with partitions so that separate compartments may be created.\n5.1.1. The partitions must be constructed in such a way that they can be placed in different positions so that the size of compartment can be adapted to specific requirements, and to the type, size and number of animals.\n6. WATER SUPPLY\n6.1. The vehicle must be equipped for connection to a water supply during stops.\n6.1.1. The vehicle must be equipped with fixed or movable devices appropriate to the different species, e.g. troughs, bowls or nipples, in order to water the animals on board the vehicle. Those devices must be so designed that the animals cannot injure themselves.\n6.2. Without prejudice to the provisions laid down in 6.1 and 6.1.1, vehicles transporting pigs must, depending on their capacity, the number of animals transported and the stops planned during the journey, be fitted with one or more water tanks of sufficient capacity so that the animals may drink at will during the journey.\nSuch water tanks must be so designed that they can be drained and cleaned after each journey and must be fitted with a system allowing their water level to be checked so that they can be refilled at any convenient moment during the journey. They must be connected to drinking devices within the compartments maintained in good working order so that pigs may have access to water at any time. In addition, a system such as spraying for hydrating pigs may be used in parallel with the above system."}
