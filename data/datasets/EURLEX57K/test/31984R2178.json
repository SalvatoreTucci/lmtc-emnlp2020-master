A nephrops or a lobster shall be considered undersized if either the cephalothoracic length or the total length is less than the specified minimum length.\nThe size of edible crabs shall be defined as the maximum width of the cephalothorax measured perpendicular to the mid-line of the cephalothorax.\nThe size of spinous spider crabs shall be defined as the maximum length of the cephalothorax measured along the mid-line from between the tips of the rostrum to the distal edge of the cephalothorax.\nThe size of a mollusc shell shall correspond to the measurement of the longest part of the shell.\nIn cases where only nephrops tails are landed, length may be expressed as tail length. In such cases, tail length shall be measured in millimetres from the front edge of the first tail segment to the rear end of the telson, not including the setae.
