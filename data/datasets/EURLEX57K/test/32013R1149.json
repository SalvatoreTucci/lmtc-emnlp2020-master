In a tub or terrine, the product may be covered with a layer of pork fat to improve its preservation.\n\u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are obtained by slowly cooking pieces of pork meat (at least 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06\u00a0cm in size) in pork fat in a cooking pot. This meat may be flavoured with white wine or distilled grape wine. (Non-nitrite) salt is added to the preparation, and pepper, E150 and Patrelle colouring may also be added.\nThe colour of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 ranges from a uniform golden yellow (pantone 142 U) to golden brown (pantone 161 U).\nThe rillettes have a thready texture and contain clearly visible coarse meat fibres (more than 2\u00a0cm in size) as well as pieces of meat.\nThe moisture content of the fat-free product should be less than or equal to 68\u00a0%, which gives it a dry texture.\n\u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 also have a browned-meat flavour.\nThe finished product meets the physico-chemical requirements for lipid levels of \u2264\u00a042\u00a0% (68\u00a0% MFFB), a total soluble sugar content of <\u00a00,5\u00a0% (68\u00a0% MFFB) and a collagen/protein ratio of \u2264\u00a019\u00a0%.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nSows must be given a rest period of at least 15 days between weaning and slaughter. The minimum age for slaughter is 172 days, and there is a mandatory feed withdrawal time of 12 hours before the pigs are sent to slaughter. The minimum warm weight of pig carcasses is 85\u00a0kg. The purpose of these requirements is to improve the quality of the taste of the meat.\nThe pieces of ham and fillet (exclusively loin cuts) should make up at least 25\u00a0% of the lean meat, to improve the quality of the finished product. The other meats come from the shoulder, neck (between the first and fifth ribs of the loin) and belly (except udders).\nTo improve the product\u2019s safety and taste, it must be made from fresh meat supplies. Fresh meat must constitute at least 75\u00a0% of the total meat used in the production process. Frozen meat must have been kept frozen by the producer of the rillettes at a temperature of \u2013\u00a018\u00a0\u00b0C for no more than one month. The purchase of frozen meats is prohibited.\nWines may be used in the production process; these must be white wines made from Chenin grape varieties. This variety has a dry, tender character.\nThe wine retains several grams of residual sugars, which give it a sweet aftertaste contrasting with the saltiness of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019. Chenin grapes have a mineral and chalky aromatic character which offsets the smokiness and saltiness of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019. In addition, the freshness, acidity and fruitiness counterbalance the fat contained in the rillettes and draw out its flavours.\nThe use of distilled grape wines is optional.\nThere is no geographical limit to the origin of the wines and distilled grape wines.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe following steps in the production of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are carried out in the geographical area defined in point 4: preparation of the meats, browning, cooking, resting and finishing.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2014\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe PGI \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 must appear on the label.\nIn addition to the information which must be provided by law, the labelling must include the following information:\n1. the trade mark;\n2. the European Union\u2019s PGI logo;\n3. the name and contact details of an addressee of complaints.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area for the production and initial packaging of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 is defined as follows:\n\u2014 the area, centred on Tours, corresponds to the distribution area of the recipe for \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019. Beyond the limits of this geographical area, the recipe for rillettes is not the same. There is also the natural barrier of the Forest of Berc\u00e9, between the river Sarthe and Indre-et-Loire,\n\u2014 the geographical area thus defined is similar to that of the former province of Touraine.\nThe area consists of the department of Indre-et-Loire (37) and the cantons located in the neighbouring departments, except for those in Sarthe (72).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\nThe connection with the geographical area is based on specific qualities of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 resulting from the application in their production of traditional know-how which has remained localised in the Touraine region. This know-how and the specific qualities of the product give it a reputation which in the mind of the consumer is closely bound with the geographical area.\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nClimatic factors\nTouraine is characterised by a mild but relatively wet climate which has impeded the natural development of dried pork products as found in the south of France. It is because of the local climate that rillettes are preserved by cooking. This climate is, however, favourable for wine-growing and the large quantity of wines produced in the area has also influenced the way in which \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are flavoured.\nHuman factors\nThe peasants of the Tours region began making rillettes in the Middle Ages. Up until the end of the 18th century, this production was very localised in the rural area around Tours and certain farms in Maine.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, local butchers took up this peasant recipe, adapted it using their know-how and handed it down from generation to generation. At this point, the rillettes became known in Touraine as \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019.\nOne of the main developments was when good quality pieces of meat began to be used instead of offcuts. The development of new preservation techniques and the fact that the product is cooked with the lid off, giving it a fairly dry texture, was to reduce the fat content and increase the meat content of the rillettes, making them a higher-quality product. This know-how, typical of the city of Tours and the Touraine region, would be developed by local artisan butchers. It was not until 1865 that this dish appeared in certain trade publications.\nEconomic factors\nThe fact that industry is not highly developed in the Touraine region has resulted in slow development of both the meat production sector, which has generally remained very small-scale in Touraine, and the sale of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019, thus preserving the home-made nature of the product.\n\u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are to this day sold by butchers who teach their apprentices how to make them.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are cooked in a pot, with the lid mostly off. The cooking process is long and traditionally consists of three stages: the initial browning of the meat (from 15 minutes to 1 hour at a temperature of between 95\u00a0\u00b0C and 115\u00a0\u00b0C), followed by a period of slow cooking (from 5,5 to 12 hours at a temperature of between 65\u00a0\u00b0C and 95\u00a0\u00b0C) and a final short period (10-20 minutes) at a high temperature (95-115\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe initial browning of lean pieces of meat and the slow cooking with the lid off, which are specific to \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019, dry out the product and produce flavour substances which result from Maillard reactions, in particular, and are characteristic of the taste of browned meat.\nThe slow cooking of the pieces of meat in their own fat produces a confit. The pieces of meat fall apart solely as a result of the cooking process, without shredding or beating, leaving their long fibres intact.\nThe dry texture of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019, developed originally to increase their shelf-life, is a result of the traditional manner in which they are cooked in an open pot with a large surface area for evaporation. The purpose of the final high-temperature stage has also always been to increase evaporation at the end of the cooking process.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe link with the geographical area is based on the traditional know-how localised in the Touraine region, giving rise to the specific qualities of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019, and also on a reputation which is closely linked with the area in the mind of the consumer.\nKnow-how\nThe low moisture content of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019, which originally improved their preservation in this humid region, later allowed them to be sold outside the Touraine region. It also accounts for why they are known to have a drier texture than rillettes prepared in neighbouring regions.\nAnother reason why \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 have retained their dry texture over the years is that their producers, most of whom are small businesses, are less concerned with production yield rates, which are below 80\u00a0%: much lower than those of many other types of rillette.\nThe low moisture content of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 means that they can be made without preservatives, even though the use of such substances is not prohibited by law.\nBecause \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 are, as described above, produced only on a small scale and knowledge of how to make them has been passed on mainly by butchers to their apprentices, this know-how has remained very localised and has in most cases not spread far beyond department borders.\nThe preservation of a very strong link with the geographical area is demonstrated by the fact that 90\u00a0% of prize winners in \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 competitions are locals.\nReputation\nThe specific characteristics of \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 have earned them a well-established reputation. They are the original artisan rillettes praised by Balzac, a native of Tours, in his 1835 novel The Lily of the Valley.\n\u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 have been popular throughout France since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1933 Curnonsky stated in Les tr\u00e9sors gastronomiques de la France: \u2018the charcuterie of Touraine has acquired a universal and legitimate renown: \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 have become known all over the world\u2019.\nEach year some 30 local butchers compete for the coveted title of maker of the best \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019. In 2011 the Paris General Agricultural Fair (Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Agricole) paid tribute to the product\u2019s reputation by opening a special \u2018Rillettes de Tours\u2019 section.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttps://www.inao.gouv.fr/fichier/CDCIGPRillettesdeToursV2.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
