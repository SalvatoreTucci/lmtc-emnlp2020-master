Production will be limited to 0,4 million tonnes in 1992, the year in which the last pit is due to be closed.\nThe amount of aid notified for 1992 represents only 14 % of the aid granted in 1986.\nThe decreasing levels of aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant, its temporary nature and the implementation of a multiannual restructuring plan are in accordance with the conditions of application of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nThe aid to cover operating losses will facilitate continuation of the last phase of the restructuring programme for the Campine coalfield, as decided by Ministerial Decree in January 1987. The planned aid will cover no more than 79 %, for each tonne  produced, of the difference between projected costs and projected revenue, and therefore complies with the provisions of Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nThe aid contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to the decline in coal production, in accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.\nThe notification submitted to the Commission regarding the financing of social benefits in the coal indusry reveals that the aid which the Belgian Government proposes to grant brings the ratio between the burden per mineworker in employment and the  benefits per person in receipt of benefit below the corresponding ratio in other industries. This difference should amount to Bfr 299 200 000 in 1992.\nThe exceeding of the limits specified in Article 7 of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC must therefore be considered as indirect aid to current production. The reduction in production costs this entails, which is about 10 %, does not constitute a significant  competitive advantage for the Belgian coal industry compared with other Community coal producers, in view of the abnormal burdens that the industry has to bear owing to the gradual decline in production.\nAs this measure is linked to the restructuring programme, it is helping to solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nThe aid to cover expenditure relating to the system of supplementary holiday for underground workers constitutes indirect aid to current production. It meets the objectives and conditions defined in Article 2 of the Decision in view of its modest scale  i.e. less than 1 % of the cost price per tonne produced, its temporary nature and the fact that it forms part of the restructuring plan.\nIII\nThe aid covered by this Decision is therefore compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision is without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of the rules governing sales of Belgian coal to electricity producers,", "main_body": ["The Belgian Government is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Bfr 1 696 180 000 to the Belgian coal industry for the 1992 calendar year.
