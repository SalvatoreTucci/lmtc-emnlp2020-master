Such products will be classifiable, from 1 January 2002, in Chapter 30 of the Combined Nomenclature, following the entry into force of the amendments to the nomenclature appended as an annex to the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System and accepted pursuant to the Recommendation of 25 June 1999. As an outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations on pharmaceutical products, Chapter 30 of the Combined Nomenclature is free of customs duties. The Contracting Parties to the Agreement on trade in pharmaceutical products have reached an understanding according to which they will provide, on an autonomous basis, duty free treatment for these gel preparations. It is in the interest of the Community autonomously to extend this exemption from customs duties to these products.\n(3) Unwrought lead for refining, containing 0,02 % or more by weight of silver (\"bullion lead\") falling within CN code 7801 99 10 is subject to a duty rate of \"free\" provided that certain conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993, laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2) are met. The Customs Code Committee set up by Article 247 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(3) has determined that \"bullion lead\" containing by weight antimony as the principal other element is classified within CN code 7801 91 00 resulting in the application of a duty rate of 2,5 %. It is in the commercial interest of the Community to provide, under the same conditions, the tariff treatment envisaged under CN code 7801 99 10 for both types of \"bullion lead\".\n(4) The Contracting Parties to the Agreement on trade in civil aircraft have reached an understanding according to which they will provide, on an autonomous basis, duty free treatment for aircraft ground maintenance simulators falling within CN code 9023 00 80.\n(5) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, the grounds of urgency should be invoked that are provided for in point 1.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation should be accompanied by end-use provisions if necessary.
