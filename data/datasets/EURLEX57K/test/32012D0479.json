Where third countries are regionalised for the purposes of inclusion in that list, their regionalised territories are set out in Part 1 of that Annex.\n(3) Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC sets out the treatments referred to in Part 2 of that Annex, assigning a code to each of those treatments. That Part sets out a non-specific treatment \u2018A\u2019 and specific treatments \u2018B\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019 listed in descending order of severity.\n(4) Following outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain areas of Israel, Decision 2007/777/EC, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0532/2012\u00a0(4), provides that imports into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines of poultry, farmed feathered game, farmed ratites and wild game birds are authorised from the areas of that third country affected by the outbreak only if they have been subjected to the specific treatment \u2018D\u2019, pursuant to Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC. The area in Israel affected by the outbreak to which regionalisation for animal health reasons applies is listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision.\n(5) Israel successfully controlled the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza according to the submitted information on the favourable disease situation with respect to that disease. In addition, surveillance carried out by the competent authority in Israel during the period which has elapsed since the stamping out of the poultry on the infected poultry holdings and the cleaning and disinfection of those premises did not reveal any further spread of disease.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend the entries for Israel in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC in order to authorise imports from the whole territory of Israel into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines of poultry, farmed feathered game, farmed ratites and wild game birds which have been subjected to a non-specific treatment \u2018A\u2019, pursuant to Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC.\n(7) Decision 2007/777/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 August 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 30.11.2007, p. 49.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 163, 22.6.2012, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Part 1, the whole entry for Israel is deleted;\n(2) in Part 2 the entry for Israel is replaced by the following:\n\u2018IL Israel B B B B A A A B B XXX A A XXX\u2019"}
