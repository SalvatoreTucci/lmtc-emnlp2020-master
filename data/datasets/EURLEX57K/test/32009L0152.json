That inclusion expires on 31\u00a0December 2009.\n(2) On request the inclusion of an active substance may be renewed for a period not exceeding 10 years. On 6 August 2007 the Commission received such a request from the notifier regarding the renewal of the inclusion for this substance.\n(3) On 10 January 2008 the notifier submitted a technical dossier to the rapporteur Member State Germany in support of its request. Germany delivered its draft reassessment report on 27 July 2009. It is necessary that the European Food Safety Authority performs a peer review.\n(4) Since it is impossible to complete the renewal procedure before the date when the inclusion of carbendazim will expire and since the request for renewal was made in sufficient time, in accordance with Article 5(5) of Directive 91/414/EEC a renewal should be granted for the period necessary to complete that procedure.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, in row No 149 (carbendazim (unstated stereochemistry) CAS No 10605-21-7 CIPAC No 263), in the sixth column (expiration of inclusion), the words \u201831 December 2009\u2019 are replaced by the words \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 December 2009 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
