That Directive is to apply from 1 August 2008.\n(4) Directive 2006/88/EC, as amended by Commission Directive 2008/53/EC, no longer lists Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) in Part II of Annex IV thereto, since the costs related to the measures to eradicate that disease would be disproportionate to the economic losses caused by it.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to delete that disease also from the list of animal diseases and zoonoses set out in the Annex to Decision 90/424/EEC.\n(6) The Annex to Decision 90/424/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 90/424/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 September 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 August 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
