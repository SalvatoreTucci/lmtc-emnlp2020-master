The tonnage of a vessel shall be gross tonnage as specified in Annex I to the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.\n2. When net tonnage is mentioned in Community rules it shall be defined as specified in the said Annex I.", "Engine power\n1. The engine power shall be the total of the maximum continuous power which can be obtained at the flywheel of each engine and which can, by mechanical, electrical, hydraulic or other means, be applied to vessel propulsion. However, where a gearbox is incorporated into the engine, the power shall be measured at the gearbox output flange.\nNo deduction shall be made in respect of auxiliary machines driven by the engine.\nThe unit in which engine power is expressed shall be the kilowatt (KW).\n2. The continuous engine power shall be determined in accordance with the requirements adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in its reommended International Standard ISO 3046/1, 2nd edition, October 1981.\n3. The amendments necessary for adapting the requirements provided for in paragraph 2 to technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 (1).", "Date of entry into service\nThe date of entry into service shall be the date of first issue of an official safety certificate.\nIf an official safety certificate is not issued, the date of entry into service shall be the date of first entry in an official register of fishing vessels.\nHowever, in the case of fishing vessels which entered service before the date on which this Regulation comes into force, the date of entry into service shall be the date of first entry in an official register of fishing vessels.", "Final provisions\n1.
