Conditions governing the approval of semen collection centres Semen collection centres must:\n1.  be placed under the supervision of a \"centre veterinarian\";\n2.  have at least (a)  lockable animal accommodation and if required for equidae an exercise area which are  physically separated from the collection facilities, the processing and storing rooms;\n(b)  isolation facilities which have no direct communication with the normal animal accommodation;\n(c)  semen collection facilities including a separate room for the cleansing and disinfection or  sterilization of equipment;\n(d)  a semen processing room separated from the collection facilities which need not necessarily be  on the same site;\n(e)  a semen storage room which need not necessarily be on the same site;\n3.  be so constructed or isolated that contact with outside livestock is prevented;\n4.  be so constructed that the entire centre except the office rooms and, in the case of equidae,  the exercise area can be readily cleaned and disinfected.\nII. Conditions for the supervision of semen collection centres Semen collection centres must:\n1.  be supervised that they contain only animals of the species whose semen is to be collected;\nHowever, other domestic animals may be admitted, provided that they present no risk of infection to  those species whose semen is to be collected and they fulfil the conditions laid down by the centre  veterinarian.\nIf in the case of equidae the collection centre shares a site with an artificial insemination or  service centre, then mares, teaser stallions and stallions for natural service are admitted  provided they meet the requirements of Annex D Chapter II paragraph A  (1), (2), (3) and (4);\n2.  be monitored to ensure that records are kept which show:\n-  the species, breed, date of birth and identification of each animal present in the centre,\n-  any movement of animals entering or leaving the centre,\n-  the health history and all diagnostic tests and the results thereof, treatments and vaccinations  carried out on animals kept,\n-  the date of collecting and processing semen,\n-  the destination of semen,\n-  the storage of semen;\n3.  be inspected by an official veterinarian during the breeding season at least once a year in the  case of animals with seasonal breeding and twice a year in the case of a nonseasonal reproduction  in order to consider and verify all matters relating to the conditions of approval and  supervision;\n4.  be so supervised that the entry of unauthorized persons is prevented. Furthermore, authorized  visitors must be required to comply with the conditions laid down by the centre veterinarian;\n5.  employ competent staff who have received adequate training on disinfection and hygiene  techniques to prevent the spread of disease;\n6.  be monitored to ensure that:\n-  none of the animals kept in the centre is used for natural breeding at least 30 days prior to  first semen collection and during the collection period,\n-  the collection, processing and storage of semen is carried out only in premises set aside for  these purposes,\n-  all utensils coming into contact with the semen or the donor animal during collection or  processing are either properly disinfected or sterilized prior to use or new, disposable and  discarded after use,\nIf, in the case of equidae, the collection centre shares a site with an artificial insemination  centre or a service centre, there must be a strict separation between instruments and equipment for  artificial insemination or natural service and instruments and equipment coming into contact with  donor animals or other animals kept in the collection centre and the semen,\n-  products of animal origin such as diluents, additives or extenders are used in the processing of  the semen, which present no animal health risk or which have undergone prior treatment to preclude  such risk,\n-  in the case of frozen or chilled semen cryogenic agents are used, which had not been used  previously for other products of animal origin,\n-  any receptacle for the storage or transport of semen is either disinfected or sterilized as  appropriate prior to use or new, disposable and discarded after use;\n7.  ensure that each individual dose of semen is indelibly identified in such a way that the Member  State of origin, date of collection, the species, the breed, the identity of the donor animal and  the name and/or number of the approved centre which collected the semen may be established.`\nANNEX II\n'A.  STALLIONS Only a stallion which to the satisfaction of the centre veterinarian meets the following  requirements may be used for the collection of semen:\n1.  it must not show any sign of an infectious or contagious disease at the time of admission and  on the day the semen is collected;\n2.  it must come from the territory or, in the case of regionalization, from the part of the  territory of a Member State or a third country and from a holding under veterinary supervision each  of which satisfy the requirements of Council Directive 90/426/EEC;\n3.  it must have been kept for 30 days prior to semen collection in holdings where no equine has  shown any clinical sign of equine viral arteritis during that period;\n4.  it must have been kept for 60 days prior to semen collection in holdings where no equine has  shown any clinical sign of contagious equine metritis during that period;\n5.  it must not be used for natural mating during 30 days prior to the first semen collection and  during the collection period;\n6.  it must be subjected to the following tests, carried out and certified in a laboratory  recognized by the competent authority according to the programme set up in paragraph 7:\n(i)  an agar-gel immuno-diffusion test (Coggins test) for equine infectious anaemia with negative  result;\n(ii)  a serum neutralization test for equine viral arteritis. Unless a negative result at a serum  dilution of 1 in 4 is achieved, a virus isolation test for equine viral arteritis shall be carried  out with negative result on an aliquot of the entire semen of the donor stallion;\n(iii)  a test for contagious equine metritis carried out on two occassions with an interval of  seven days by isolation of Taylorella equigenitalis from pre-ejaculatory fluid or a semen sample  and from genital swabs taken at least from the penile sheath, urethra and urethral fossa with  negative result in each case;\n7.  it must have been subjected to one of the following testing programmes:\n(i)  Where semen is collected for trade in fresh or chilled semen:\n-  and the donor stallion is continuously resident on the collection centre for at least 30 days  prior to the first semen collection and during the collection period, and no equidae on the  collection centre come into direct contact with equidae of lower health status than the donor  stallion, the tests required in paragraphs 6 (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be carried out at least 14  days after the start of the above residence period and at least once a year at the beginning of the  breeding season.\n-  and the donor stallion is not continuously resident on the collection centre, and/or other  equidae on the collection centre come into direct contact with equidae of lower health status, the  tests required in paragraphs 6 (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be carried out within the 14 day period  before the first semen collection and at least once a year at the beginning of the breeding season.  Furthermore, the test required in paragraph 6 (i) shall be repeated at least every 120 days during  the period of semen collection. The test required in paragraph 6 (ii) shall be carried out not more  than 30 days before each semen collection, unless the non-shedder state of a seropositive stallion  for equine viral arteritis is confirmed by virus isolation test which must be carried out  annually.\n(ii)  Where semen is collected for trade in frozen semen, the testing programmes as described in  paragraph 7 (i) first and second indent shall apply or, alternatively, the tests required in  paragraph 6 (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be carried out during the mandatory 30 days storage period of  the semen and not less than 14 days after the collection of the semen, irrespective of the  residence status of the stallion.`\nANNEX III\n'C.  If any of the tests referred to in A or B proves positive, that animal  must be isolated and the semen, collected from it since the last negative test shall not be subject  of trade.
