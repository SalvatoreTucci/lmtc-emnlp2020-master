Detailed rules for the administration of these quotas are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a0659/2007 of 14 June 2007 opening and providing for the administration of import tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds\u00a0(2).\n(2) The use of the first-come, first-served principle has proved positive in other agricultural sectors, and in the interest of administrative simplification, these quotas should henceforth be administered in accordance with the method indicated in Article\u00a0144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3).\n(3) Due to the particularities of the transfer from one administrative system to the other, the quotas to which this Regulation refers should be regarded as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(4) Article 166 of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4) provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their specific use. Animals imported under the tariff quotas provided for in this Regulation should be supervised for a sufficient period to ensure that they are not slaughtered during that period.\n(5) To that end, a security should be lodged, the amount of which should cover the difference between the Common Customs Tariff duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals concerned.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 659/2007 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation opens import tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds as given in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quotas given in the Annex to this Regulation shall be administered in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93.
