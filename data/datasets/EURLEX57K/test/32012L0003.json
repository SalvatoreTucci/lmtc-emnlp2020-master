That list includes bendiocarb.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, bendiocarb has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.\n(3) The United Kingdom was designated as rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 1 April 2008 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 22 September 2011, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods and containing bendiocarb may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include bendiocarb in Annex I to that Directive.\n(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. For example, the assessment only considers professional use, and does not cover direct application to soil or application on food or feedstuff or on surfaces that will come in contact with food or feedstuff. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(7) In view of the risks identified for the aquatic environment due to wet cleaning of treated surfaces, resulting in emissions of a certain scale to surface waters, it is appropriate to require that products not be authorised for use on surfaces that are prone to frequent wet cleaning, other than crack and crevice or spot treatments, unless data are submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of both Article 5 of and Annex VI to Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.\n(8) In view of the risks identified for human health, it is appropriate to require that products authorised for industrial or professional use must be used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to industrial or professional users can be reduced to an acceptable level by other means.\n(9) In view of the potential risk to honey bees, it is appropriate to require that, where relevant, action is taken to prevent foraging bees gaining access to treated nests by removing the combs or blocking the nest entrances.\n(10) The provisions of this Directive should be applied at the same time in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products containing the active substance bendiocarb and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(12) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(13) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 January 2013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 February 2014.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
