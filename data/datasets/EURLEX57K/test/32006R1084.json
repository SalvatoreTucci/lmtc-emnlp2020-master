It sets out, in particular, the objectives, the principles and the rules concerning partnership, programming, evaluation and management. It is therefore necessary to specify the mission of the Cohesion Fund in relati on to the new framework for its action and in relation to the purpose assigned to it in the Treaty and to repeal, in the interests of clarity, Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01164/94 of 16\u00a0May 1994 establishing the Cohesion Fund\u00a0(5).\n(2) Trans-European transport network projects financed by the Cohesion Fund are to comply with the guidelines for trans-European transport networks adopted by the Council\u00a0and the European Parliament.

Specific provisions should therefore be laid down for the exceptions related to the Cohesion Fund.\n(5) Conditionality provisions in the granting of financial assistance should continue to apply in conjunction with the fulfilment of the conditions of economic convergence as set out in Article\u00a099 of the Treaty and the need for sound government finances. In this respect, Member States having adopted the euro are to implement stability programmes and Member States not having adopted the euro convergence programmes, as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01466/97 of 7\u00a0July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies\u00a0(7), leading to the avoidance of excessive government deficits referred to in Article\u00a0104 of the Treaty.
