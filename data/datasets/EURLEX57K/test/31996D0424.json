Without prejudice to other Community legislation and subject to the conditions outlined in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, consent shall be given by the authorities of the Netherlands for the placing on the market of the following product, notified by Bejo-Zaden BV (Ref. C/NL/94/25), under Article 13 of Directive 90/220/EEC.\nThe product consists of seeds and plants derived from chicory (Cichorium intybus L. subspecies radicchio rosso) lines (RM3-3, RM3-4 and RM3-6) which have been transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens disarmed Ti-plasmid containing between the T-DNA borders:\n(i) the barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (a ribonuclease) with the promoter PTA29 from Nicotiana tabacum and the terminator of the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens;\n(ii) the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) with the promoter PSsuAra-tp from Arabidopsis thaliana and the TL-DNA gene 7 terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens;\n(iii) the neo gene from Escherichia coli (a neomycin phosphotransferase II) with the promoter of the nopaline synthase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the octopine synthase gene terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.\n2. This consent covers any progeny derived from crosses of this product with any traditionally bred chicory.\n3. The present consent covers the use of the product for breeding activities.\n4. Without prejudice to labelling required by other Community legislation, it shall be indicated on the label of each package of seeds that the product:\n- is to be used for breeding activities,\n- and may be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 1996.\nFor the Commission\nRitt BJERREGAARD\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 117, 8. 5. 1990, p. 15.\n(2) OJ No L 103, 22. 4. 1994, p. 20.\n(3) OJ No L 230, 19. 8. 1991, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 65, 15. 3. 1996, p. 20."}
