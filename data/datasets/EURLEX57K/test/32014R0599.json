Decisions on the items subject to controls are taken within the framework of the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 provides for the list of dual-use items set out in Annex I to that Regulation to be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modifications thereto, that Member States have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties.\n(4) The list of dual-use items set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 needs to be updated regularly so as to ensure full compliance with international security obligations, to guarantee transparency, and to maintain competitiveness of exporters. Delays with regard to the updating of that list of dual-use items may have negative effects on security and international non-proliferation efforts, as well as on the performance of economic activities by exporters in the Union. At the same time, the technical nature of the amendments and the fact that those amendments are to be in conformity with decisions taken in the international export control regimes means that an accelerated procedure should be used to bring the necessary updates into force in the Union.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 introduces Union General Export Authorisations as one of the four types of export authorisations available under that Regulation. Union General Export Authorisations allow exporters established in the Union to export certain specified items to certain specified destinations subject to the conditions of those authorisations.\n(6) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 sets out the Union General Export Authorisations currently in force in the Union. Given the nature of such Union General Export Authorisations, there may be a need to remove certain destinations from the scope of those authorisations, in particular if changing circumstances show that facilitated export transactions should no longer be authorised under a Union General Export Authorisation for a particular destination. Such removal of a destination from the scope of a Union General Export Authorisation should not preclude an exporter from applying for another type of export authorisation under the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009.\n(7) In order to ensure regular and timely updates of the common list of dual-use items in conformity with the obligations and commitments taken by Member States within the international export control regimes, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 within the scope of Article 15 of that Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(8) In order to allow for a swift Union response to changing circumstances as regards the assessment of the sensitivity of exports under Union General Export Authorisations, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 as regards the removal of destinations from the scope of the Union General Export Authorisations. Given that such modifications should only be made in response to an increase in the assessment of the risk of the relevant exports, and that the continued use of Union General Export Authorisations for those exports could have an imminent adverse effect on the security of the Union and its Member States, an urgency procedure may be used by the Commission.\n(9) The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 9(1), the following subparagraphs are added:\n(2) in Article 15, the following paragraph is added:\n(3) the following Articles are inserted:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 16 April 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.

KOURKOULAS\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Position of the European Parliament of 23 October 2012 (OJ C 68 E, 7.3.2014, p. 112) and position of the Council at first reading of 3 March 2014 (OJ C 100, 4.4.2014, p. 6). Position of the European Parliament of 3 April 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (OJ L 134, 29.5.2009, p. 1).\nJoint Statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the review of the dual-use export control system\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recognise the importance of continuously enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of the EU\u2019s strategic export controls regime, ensuring a high level of security and adequate transparency without impeding competitiveness and legitimate trade in dual-use items.\nThe three institutions consider that modernisation and further convergence of the system is needed in order to keep up with new threats and rapid technological changes, to reduce distortions, create a genuine common market for dual-use items (uniform level playing field for exporters) and continue serving as an export control model for third countries.\nTo this end, it is essential to streamline the process for updating the control lists (Annexes to the Regulation); strengthen risk assessment and exchange of information, develop improved industry standards, and reduce disparities in implementation.\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission acknowledge the issues regarding the export of certain information and communication technologies (ICT) that can be used in connection with human rights violations as well as to undermine the EU\u2019s security, particularly for technologies used for mass-surveillance, monitoring, tracking, tracing and censoring, as well as for software vulnerabilities.\nTechnical consultations have been initiated in this respect, including in the framework of EU Dual Use Peer Visit, the Dual Use Coordination Group, and the export control regimes, and actions continue to be taken to address situations of urgency through sanctions (pursuant to Article 215 TFEU), or national measures. Efforts will also be intensified to promote multilateral agreements in the context of export control regimes, and options will be explored to address this issue in the context of the on-going review of EU dual-use export control policy, and the preparation of a Commission Communication. In this context the three institutions took note of the agreement on 4 December 2013 by the Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement to adopt controls on complex surveillance tools that enable unauthorised access to computer systems, and on IP-network surveillance systems.\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission also commit to further development of the existing \u2018catch-all\u2019 mechanism for dual-use items falling outside the Annex I of the Regulation, in order to further enhance the export control system and its application within the European single market.\nCommission Statement on delegated acts\nIn the context of this Regulation, the Commission recalls the commitment it has taken in paragraph 15 of the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission to provide to the Parliament full information and documentation on its meetings with national experts within the framework of its work on the preparation of delegated acts.\nCommission Statement on updating the Regulation\nIn order to ensure a more integrated, efficient and coherent European approach to the movement (exports, transfer, brokering and transit) of strategic items, the Commission will put forward a new proposal for updating the Regulation as expeditiously as possible."}
