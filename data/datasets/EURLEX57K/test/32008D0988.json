Article 9 of that Directive provides criteria for approving compulsory national control programmes for certain contagious diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease. In addition, Article 10 of that Directive requires documentation for approving a Member State or region thereof as being free of certain contagious diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease.\n(2) Commission Decision 2008/185/EC of 21 February 2008 on additional guarantees in intra-Community trade of pigs relating to Aujeszky\u2019s disease and criteria to provide information on this disease\u00a0(2) lays down the additional guarantees for movements of pigs between Member States. Those guarantees are linked to the classification of Member States according to their disease status.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC lists Member States or regions thereof which are free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited. Annex II to that Decision lists Member States or regions thereof where approved control programmes for Aujeszky\u2019s disease are in place.\n(4) The Netherlands and Hungary have submitted supporting documentation to the Commission as regards their Aujeszky\u2019s disease status. In both Member States, national control programmes for Aujeszky\u2019s disease have been implemented for several years.\n(5) The Commission has examined the documentation submitted by those two Member States and found that the Netherlands complies with Article 10(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. Accordingly, that Member State should be included in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC.\n(6) The Commission has also found that the national control programme presented by Hungary complies with the criteria laid down in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. Accordingly, Hungary should be included in the list set out in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC.\n(7) Decision 2008/185/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2008/185/EC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p.\u00a01977/64.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a059, 4.3.2008, p.\u00a019.\nANNEX\nANNEX I\nMember States or regions thereof free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited\nISO code Member State Regions\nAT Austria All regions\nCY Cyprus All regions\nCZ Czech Republic All regions\nDE Germany All regions\nDK Denmark All regions\nFI Finland All regions\nFR France The departments of Ain, Aisne, Allier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, Ard\u00e8che, Ardennes, Ari\u00e8ge, Aube, Aude, Aveyron, Bas-Rhin, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Calvados, Cantal, Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cher, Corr\u00e8ze, C\u00f4te-d\u2019Or, C\u00f4tes-d\u2019Armor, Creuse, Deux-S\u00e8vres, Dordogne, Doubs, Dr\u00f4me, Essonne, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Finist\u00e8re, Gard, Gers, Gironde, Hautes-Alpes, Hauts-de-Seine, Haute Garonne, Haute-Loire, Haute-Marne, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Haut-Rhin, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, Haute-Savoie, Haute-Vienne, H\u00e9rault, Ille-et-Vilaine, Indre, Indre-et-Loire, Is\u00e8re, Jura, Landes, Loire, Loire-Atlantique, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Loz\u00e8re, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Marne, Mayenne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Morbihan, Moselle, Ni\u00e8vre, Nord, Oise, Orne, Paris, Pas-de-Calais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, R\u00e9union, Rh\u00f4ne, Sarthe, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Savoie, Seine-et-Marne, Seine-Maritime, Seine-Saint-Denis, Somme, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne, Territoire de Belfort, Val-de-Marne, Val-d\u2019Oise, Var, Vaucluse, Vend\u00e9e, Vienne, Vosges, Yonne, Yvelines\nLU Luxembourg All regions\nNL The Netherlands All regions\nSK Slovakia All regions\nSE Sweden All regions\nUK United Kingdom All regions in England, Scotland and Wales\nANNEX II\nMember States or regions thereof where approved Aujeszky\u2019s disease control programmes are in place\nISO code Member State Regions\nBE Belgium All regions\nES Spain The territory of the Autonomous Communities of Galicia, Pa\u00eds Vasco, Asturias, Cantabria, Navarra, La Rioja\nHU Hungary All regions\nIT Italy The province of Bolzano"}
