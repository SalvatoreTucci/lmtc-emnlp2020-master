In that report it came to the conclusion that (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt meets the criteria set out in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(3) On 28 February 2012, the Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to the other Member States.\n(4) Reasoned objections were raised within the 60-day period laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(5) On 14 September 2012 and on 5 March 2013 the Commission consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asking it to carry out an additional assessment for (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt as food ingredient in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(6) On 11 September 2013, EFSA adopted a Scientific Opinion on (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt as a source of folate added for nutritional purposes to food supplements\u00a0(2), concluding that (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt is not of safety concern as a source of folate.\n(7) The opinion gives sufficient grounds to establish that (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt as a source of folate complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(8) Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), lays down specific provisions for the use of vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The use of (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt should be authorised without prejudice to the requirements of this legislation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["(6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt as a source of folate as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient to be used in food supplements without prejudice to the specific provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC.", "The designation of (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt, authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018(6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, glucosamine salt\u2019 or \u20185MTHF-glucosamine\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Gnosis SpA, Via Lavoratori Autobianchi 1, 20832 Desio (MB), Italy."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;11(10):3358.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements (OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p. 51).\nANNEX\nSPECIFICATION OF (6S)-5-METHYLTETRAHYDROFOLIC ACID, GLUCOSAMINE SALT\nDefinition:\nChemical name N-[4-[[[(6S)-2-amino-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-6-pteridinyl]methyl]amino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, glucosamine salt\nChemical formula C32H51N9O16\nMolecular weight 817,80\u00a0g/mol (anhydrous)\nDescription: Creamy to light-brown powder.\nIdentification:\nCAS No. 1181972-37-1\nPurity:\nDiastereoisomeric purity At least 99\u00a0% of (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid\nGlucosamine assay 34-36\u00a0% in dry basis\n5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid assay 54-59\u00a0% in dry basis\nWater content Not more than 8,0\u00a0%\nLead Not more than 2,0\u00a0ppm\nCadmium Not more than 1,0\u00a0ppm\nMercury Not more than 0,1\u00a0ppm\nArsenic Not more than 2,0\u00a0ppm\nBoron Not more than 10\u00a0ppm\nMicrobiological criteria:\nTotal aerobic microbial count Not more than 100\u00a0cfu/g\nTotal combined yeast and moulds Not more than 100\u00a0cfu/g\nEscherichia coli Absent in 10\u00a0g"}
