That Regulation effects a closure of the fishery for three months from 3 July 2005.\n(2) New advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) confirms that the stock is at a dangerously low level, that the decision to close the fishery was correct, and that the fishery should remain closed until fishery independent data becomes available to provide a reliable estimate of the spawning stock size.\n(3) The existing closure should therefore be extended.\n(4) As it is impossible to distinguish, for control purposes, between anchovy caught in ICES sub-area VIII and that caught in other areas, it is necessary to prohibit retention on board, transhipment and landing of anchovy within ICES sub-area VIII, wherever it was caught.\n(5) The Commission will, within the closure period, make an assessment of scientific and technical criteria to be applied when deciding on a reopening of the fishery.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate for the Commission to extend and adapt, the emergency measures to protect the anchovy stock,", "main_body": ["Fishing for anchovy in ICES sub-area VIII shall be prohibited.
