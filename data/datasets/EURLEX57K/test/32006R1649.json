In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) In cases where the export refund varies according to destination, Article 18(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(5), lays down that the part of the refund, calculated on the basis of the lowest rate of refund, applicable on the day when the customs export formalities are completed, is to be paid when proof is provided that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.\n(3) Article 4(1) and (7) and Article 5(1) and (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products\u00a0(6), allow the part of the refund calculated on the basis of the lowest rate to be paid as soon as the product has been placed under the special procedure set up by the said Regulation.\n(4) Under the special arrangements drawn up with certain third countries, the rate of refund applicable on exports to those countries of certain products in the egg and poultrymeat sectors may be lower, and sometimes substantially lower, than the refund normally applied. It also sometimes happens that no refund is fixed.\n(5) The lowest rate of refund also results from the fact that a refund has not been fixed.\n(6) Where a refund is not fixed for exports, measures introduced in the United States guarantee that products which have qualified for a refund for other destinations may not be imported into that country. An exception should also be provided for determining the lowest rate of refund for exports to the United States. Experience shows that the products in question may qualify for this exception not only with regard to the application of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 but also with regard to the application of Articles 4(1) and (7) and Article 5(1) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["The fact that no refund is fixed for products falling within CN codes 0105\u00a011, 0105\u00a012, 0105\u00a019, 0207 (excluding 0207\u00a034, 0207\u00a013\u00a091, 0207\u00a014\u00a091, 0207\u00a026\u00a091, 0207\u00a027\u00a091, 0207\u00a035\u00a091, 0207\u00a036\u00a081, 0207\u00a036\u00a085 and 0207\u00a036\u00a089), 0407, 0408, and 1602\u00a032 which are exported to the United States of America shall not be taken into consideration:\n\u2014 for determining the lowest rate of refund for the purposes of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999,\n\u2014 for applying Articles 4(7) and 5(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80.", "Regulation (EEC) No 109/80 is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2006.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 49.
