The required documents provide the Commission with essential information on the evolution of expenditure for rural development both for the financial year in question and for future years, which can then be taken into account for the determination of the advances to be paid and for budget preparations. Article 37(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999 therefore provides that, where the documents referred to in Article 37(1) are incomplete or the time limit has not been met, the Commission shall reduce advances on entry in the accounts of agricultural expenditure on a temporary and flat-rate basis. For the implementation of this provision, it is appropriate to limit the financial effects to the financial year concerned by the declaration of expenditure and to provide for the suspension of the advance for the month of September only. Article 4(6) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1577/2001(5), should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(2) Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96 defines the documents to be transmitted, for the 20th day of each month, to the Commission to permit the booking to the Community budget of expenditure effected during the preceding month. It is appropriate that this documentation should include the accounts evidencing expenditure relating to public storage referred to in Article 4(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1259/96(7).\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Fund Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 296/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
