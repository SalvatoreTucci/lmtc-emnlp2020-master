As a result, transport and marketing of hatching eggs were temporarily banned within Belgium.\n(2) The restrictions on the free movement of hatching eggs resulting from the application of the veterinary measures threatened severe disruption of the market in hatching eggs in Belgium. The Belgian authorities adopted market support measures, restricted to hatching eggs, for the period for which this was absolutely necessary. These allowed hatching eggs for which incubation was no longer possible to be used to produce egg products.\n(3) Those measures had a positive impact on the market for hatching eggs and eggs in general. This justifies their being treated as exceptional market support measures within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and the granting of aid to compensate for part of the financial loss resulting from processing hatching eggs into egg products.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use for processing of hatching eggs falling within CN code 0407\u00a000\u00a019 between l6 April and 5 May 2003, decided on by the Belgian authorities following the application of Decision 2003/289/EC, is hereby deemed to be an exceptional market support measure within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the measure referred to in paragraph 1, compensation of:\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,097 per hatching egg from broiler strains shall be granted for a maximum of 5\u00a0372\u00a0000\u00a0eggs,\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,081 per hatching egg from laying strains shall be granted for a maximum of 314\u00a0000\u00a0eggs,\n\u2014 EUR\u00a00,265 per hatching egg from multiplication strains shall be granted for a maximum of 99\u00a0000\u00a0eggs.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 49.
