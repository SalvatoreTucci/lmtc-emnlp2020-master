Chapter II B(3) of that Annex provides that processed petfood other than canned petfood must undergo certain heat treatment during processing.\n(3) The requirements for the importation into the Community of processed petfood other than canned petfood were amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 829/2007\u00a0(2); the model health certificate for processed petfood other than canned petfood which has to accompany imported consignments was modified. According to the new health certificate set out in Chapter 3(B) of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the processed petfood must not be heat-treated if the ingredients of animal origin which are used have already been treated in accordance with the processing standards for their placing on the market in the Community. Those standards provide for adequate protection against risks for public and animal health.\n(4) Article 28 to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides that the provisions in that Regulation applicable to the importation of certain products, including that processed petfood are to be no more favourable or less favourable than those applicable to the production and marketing of those products in the Community. Therefore, those provisions applicable for the importation of that processed petfood into the Community should also apply for the production of that processed petfood in the Community.\n(5) Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0273, 10.10.2002, p.\u00a01.
