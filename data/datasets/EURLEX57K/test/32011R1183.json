The Research Grouping contributes both financially and in kind to the objectives of the FCH Joint Undertaking. Given the specific composition of the FCH Joint Undertaking, as well as its rules and the nature, objectives and scope of its activities, the members of the Research Grouping may benefit from the results achieved in the same manner as the members of the Industry Grouping. Therefore, it is justified to allow the in-kind contribution from both the Industry Grouping and Research Grouping to be counted as matching funds.\n(3) The Research Grouping became a member of the FCH Joint Undertaking, and it is therefore appropriate to consider that in-kind contributions from research organisations (including universities and research centres) match the contribution of the Union, within the meaning of the Statutes of the FCH Joint Undertaking annexed to Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 (hereinafter referred as the \u2018Statutes\u2019).\n(4) The FCH Joint Undertaking has been operating for more than 2 years, and during this period the entire operational cycle with publishing calls for proposals, evaluations of proposals, negotiations of funding and conclusion of grant agreements has been completed. Experience gained during this period has shown that the maximum funding levels in FCH Joint Undertaking projects had to be reduced significantly for all participants. As a result, the level of participation in the actions of the FCH Joint Undertaking proved to be significantly below initial expectations.\n(5) The Governing Board approved the amendments to Regulation (EC) No 521/2008, in accordance with the Statutes.\n(6) Allowing in-kind contributions from all legal entities participating in the activities to be counted as matching funding would recognise the membership of the Research Grouping and would improve the funding levels while still respecting the fundamental principle of matching, as well as the need to apply fair and balanced funding reductions to the different types of participants.\n(7) The running costs of the Programme Office of the FCH Joint Undertaking (hereinafter referred as the \u2018Programme Office\u2019) should be covered by its three members. It is appropriate to provide that all members of the FCH Joint Undertaking have the same payment schedule.\n(8) The Commission should be given some flexibility regarding the measures to be taken in case of insufficient matching.\n(9) Currently the level of funding is determined after each evaluation of proposals received. To enable beneficiaries to estimate the extent of the potential funding, it should be possible for each call to specify the minimum level of funding.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 521/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 6, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Notwithstanding Article 12(3) of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 521/2008, this amending Regulation shall not affect the rights and obligations arising under the grant agreements and other contracts concluded by the FCH Joint Undertaking before the entry into force of this Regulation.
