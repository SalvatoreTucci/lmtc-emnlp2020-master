That list includes alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil and phenmedipham.\n(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment has been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the Rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(3), the following rapporteur Member States were designated, which in turn submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. For alpha-cypermethrin the rapporteur Member State was Belgium, and all relevant information was submitted on 16 September 1999. For benalaxyl the rapporteur Member State was Portugal, and all relevant information was submitted on 27 April 2000. For bromoxynil the rapporteur Member State was France, and all relevant formation was submitted on 16 March 2000. For desmedipham the rapporteur Member State was Finland, and all relevant information was submitted on 8 May 2000. For ioxynil the rapporteur Member State was France, and all relevant information was submitted on 16 March 2000. For phenmedipham the rapporteur Member State was Finland, and all relevant information was submitted on 5 January 2000.\n(3) Those assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(4) The reviews of all active substances were finalised on 13 February 2004 in the format of the Commission review reports for alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil and phenmedipham.\n(5) The reviews of alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil and phenmedipham did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.\n(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil and phenmedipham may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil or phenmedipham, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. For efficiency reasons and considering the short deadlines it is appropriate that the rapporteur Member State coordinate such reviews between Member States. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 August 2005 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

On the basis of that evaluation, they shall determine whether the product satisfies the conditions set out in Article 4(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\nFollowing that determination Member States shall:\n(a) in the case of a product containing alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil or phenmedipham as the only active substance, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 28 February 2009 at the latest; or\n(b) in the case of a product containing alpha-cypermethrin, benalaxyl, bromoxynil, desmedipham, ioxynil or phenmedipham as one of several active substances, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 28 February 2009 or by the date fixed for such an amendment or withdrawal in the respective Directive or Directives which added the relevant substance or substances to Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, whichever is the latest.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 1 March 2005.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 April 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
