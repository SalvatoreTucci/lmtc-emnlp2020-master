Pyrotechnic articles, however, are expressly excluded from the scope of that Directive.\n(2) Consequently, in order to ensure the uniform application of Directive 93/15/EEC throughout the Community, it is necessary to identify, by reference to the relevant United Nations recommendations, articles which are to be considered to be pyrotechnic.\n(3) Certain articles falling within Class 1 of the United Nations recommendations have a dual function, since it is possible to use them either as explosives or as pyrotechnic articles. Provision should therefore be made, in the interests of the consistent application of Directive 93/15/EEC, for the identification of those articles in terms of their predominant character, that is to say, as explosives or as pyrotechnic articles.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 13 of Directive 93/15/EEC,", "main_body": ["Annex I to this Directive lists, for the purposes of implementing the second and in part the third indent of Article 1(3) of Directive 93/15/EEC, the articles considered in the relevant United Nations recommendations to be pyrotechnic articles or ammunition.", "Annex II to this Directive lists articles in respect of which a determination is required, for the purposes of implementing the second indent of Article 1(3) of Directive 93/15/EEC, as to whether those articles are pyrotechnic articles or explosives.", "1.
