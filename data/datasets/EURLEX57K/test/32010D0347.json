Use of a common electronic system should be introduced to overcome this situation.\n(6) In the \u2018Small Business Act\u2019 for Europe\u00a0(3) and in the Third Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the European Union\u00a0(4) the European Commission has committed to the objective of increasing predictability and helping business to better prepare for legislative changes. Specifically a system of common commencement dates to ensure that, where possible, the date of application of legislation affecting business corresponds to certain fixed dates during the year has been identified as a measure to achieve this objective. This should be taken into account when setting the date of application of this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 13(1) of Directive 93/15/EEC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/388/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
