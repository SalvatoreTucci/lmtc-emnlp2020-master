Tenders could thus be lodged in good faith by traders during those weeks, although no Management Committee meetings are scheduled.\n(3) It is necessary, therefore, to exclude the weeks up to 28\u00a0June 2006 during which no invitation to tender will be made.\n(4) In view of foreseeable market requirements and the quantities which the Polish intervention agency has in its possession, Poland has informed the Commission that its intervention body intends to increase the amount put out to tender by 65\u00a0197 tonnes. In view of the market situation, the request made by Poland should be granted.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1164/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1164/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, \u201890\u00a0000 tonnes\u2019 is replaced by \u2018155\u00a0197 tonnes\u2019;\n2. in Article 4(1), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.
