Certain Member States have requested that import of fumigated oak logs takes place only through specified ports where the appropriate handling and inspection facilities are available.\n(4) It is also possible to dispense with fumigation, as regards oak wood belonging to the white oak group, under certain technical conditions. Certain Member States have requested a further derogation to allow importations of white oak during certain months of the year. This second derogation should be limited to those parts of the Community where potential vectors of Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt have little or no activity during the winter, i.e. to areas north of 45o latitude.\n(5) The Commission will ensure that the United States of America makes available all technical information necessary to monitor the functioning of the protective measures required.\n(6) The Member States should therefore be granted a derogation, for a limited period of time, for the introduction of oak (Quercus L.) logs with bark from the United States of America.\n(7)

Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2005/16/EC (OJ L 57, 3.3.2005, p. 19).\nANNEX I\nCONDITIONS ON FUMIGATION AND RELATED IDENTIFICATION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2.1\n1. The logs shall have been piled on an impervious surface under a gas-proof cover in such a way and to such a height as to ensure effective gas dispersal through the logs.\n2. Without prejudice to any additional export requirements set by the official plant protection organisation of the United States of America (i.e. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \u2014 APHIS) the pile shall have undergone fumigation with pure methyl bromide which is carried out at a minimum rate of 240\u00a0g/m3 of total volume under cover for 72 hours and at a temperature of the logs of at least +\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C. After 24 hours of treatment, an addition of gas shall have been made to regain the aforementioned concentration; the temperature of the logs shall have been maintained at +\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C, at least, throughout the procedure. It may be decided, based on scientific evidence and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC, that other methods shall or may be used.\n3. The fumigation procedures as described in 1 and 2 shall have been carried out by officially licensed fumigation operatives, using proper fumigation facilities and qualified staff to requisite standards.\n4. A fumigation batch identification mark (digits and/or letters) shall have been placed in a non-removable manner on the base end of each log of the pile undergoing fumigation. The fumigation batch identification mark shall have been reserved to the shipper. It shall not have been used for logs of other batches. Records of the identification marks shall be kept by the licensed fumigation operatives.\n5. The individual fumigation procedure including the marking referred to in 4 shall have been systematically supervised at the fumigation sites, directly by officials of the official plant protection organisation concerned or by cooperating State/province officials in such a way as to guarantee compliance with the requirements laid down in 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n6. The official phytosanitary certificate required pursuant to Article 13(1)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC shall have been issued by the official plant protection organisation concerned after finalisation of the fumigation, and have been based on the actions mentioned in 5 and the examination carried out in accordance with Article 6 of the said Directive relating to the conditions laid down in Article 6(1)(a) of that Directive and in this Annex.\n7. This certificate shall indicate the botanical name of the genus or the species, the number of logs in the consignment and the fumigation batch identification marks referred to in 4, without prejudice to the information required under the section related to disinfestation and/or disinfection treatment.\n8. In the case of logs to be dispatched via Canadian ports of shipment, all or part of the measures set out in points 1 to 7 and to be carried out by the official plant protection organisation concerned, may be carried out by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).\nANNEX II\nPORTS OF UNLOADING\n1.

Samples which show no red coloration after three days soaking are considered as having been adequately fumigated.\nANNEX IV\nWHITE OAK LOG IDENTIFICATION\n1. Officials of the official plant protection organisation concerned shall have identified each log as belonging to the white oak group either by visual means, as far as possible, or by carrying out white oak log identification colour tests as specified in 2. This identification colour test shall be performed on at least 10\u00a0% of the logs per consignment.\n2. The white oak log identification colour test shall be carried out by means of spraying or painting 10\u00a0% sodium nitrite solution to an area of clean superficially dried heartwood at least five centimetres in diameter. Evaluation of the test shall be done within 20 to 60 minutes of application. At temperatures below 2,5\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0% ethylene glycol can be added to the solution as an antifreeze agent.

Each log shall be marked \u2018WO\u2019, under the supervision of the official plant protection organisation concerned or cooperating State/province officials.\n4. The official phytosanitary certificate required pursuant to Article 13(1)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC shall be issued by the official plant protection organisation concerned, and be based on the actions mentioned in 1, 2 and 3.
