Such authorisations are required to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\n(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\n(3) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.\n(4) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.\n(5) Information on new or changed uses of certain pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC has been notified to the Commission. This concerns ethofumesate, lambda-cyhalothrin, methomyl, pymetrozine and thiabendazole\n(6) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of those pesticides.\n(7) In the light of technological and scientific developments, it may be appropriate to set specific MRLs for products which are relatively new in the Community, such as \u2018Papaya\u2019 and \u2018Cassava.\u2019 The list of examples within the groups specified in Annex I to Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for ethofumesate in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The item \u2018papaya\u2019 is added to Annex I to Directive 90/642/EEC under the category 1(vi) miscellaneous fruit between the items \u2018Olives\u2019 and \u2018Passion fruit\u2019.
