In particular, research will be continued on the characterization and description of the various barriers considered, both engineered and natural (geological), and the findings will be used to  evaluate the long-term safety of this waste disposal concept.\n2.\nTechnical content\nIndicative breakdown of\nthe amount\n(millions of ecus)\nPART A  Waste management and associated R &   D projects\nA1\nStudies of management systems\n5,4 (\u00b9)\nTask 1: Study of systems including analytical models for minimizing the transport of waste. Harmonization of policies and practices concerning the management of waste, including waste from dismantling operations and irradiated fuels. Information for the  general public. The system studies will concern the evaluation of various scenarios for the management of different types of waste. Harmonization work will mainly involve the development of common waste-management criteria and schemes.\nA2\nTreatment of waste\n7,5 (\u00b9)\nTask 2: Treatment and packaging of waste, including unreprocessed irradiated fuel, where this is considered as waste. Treatment of radioactive waste. The work will concern the development of advanced processes for minimizing the production of waste,  minimizing the discharge of radioactive effluent into the environment and reducing\nthe volume of waste for disposal and study of the potentialities of transmutation.\nA3\nSafety of the multi-barrier system of geological disposal\n39,2 (\u00b9)\nTask 3: Characterization and description of waste forms, packages and their environment. The various waste packages will be studied in an environment representative of final storage so that the safety of their long-term behaviour can be ascertained. The  quality control of waste forms will also be developed.\nTask 4: Disposal of radioactive waste: research to back up the development of underground repositories. The work will concern the radionuclide isolation properties of the various types of rock envisaged for the disposal of waste, and also some design  aspects of the construction and operation of underground repositories in such environments, the aim being to evaluate their feasibility and safety.\nTask 5: Methods of evaluating the safety of disposal systems. The methods developed hitherto will be perfected and extended to new types of waste, in order to carry out a comprehensive safety assessment of radioactive waste storage facilities, taking  into account their radiological and environmental impact and nuclear safety.\nPART B  Construction and/or operation of underground facilities open to Community joint activities\n27,5 (\u00b9)\nProject 1 Pilot underground facility in the Asse salt mine in the Federal Republic of Germany\nProject 2\nPilot underground facility in the argillaceous layer under the Mol nuclear site in Belgium\nProject 3\nUnderground validation facility in France\nProject 4\nUnderground validation facility in the United Kingdom\nOther projects could be added in the course of the execution of the programme\nTotal\n79,6 (\u00b9)\n3.\nImplementation\nThe programme will be implemented mainly through shared-cost research contracts with appropriate organizations, undertakings and companies - public or private - established in the Member States. Small and medium-sized undertakings will be encouraged to  take part in the programme.\nTogether with the invitation to participate in the programme, the Commission will send out information brochures in all the Community languages so as to give an equal opportunity to undertakings, universities and research centres in the Member States.\nIn addition to shared-cost research contracts, the programme may also be carried out by means of study contracts, co-ordination projects and awards of training and mobility grants. Such contracts and grants will, where appropriate, be awarded following  a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communtities.\nThe Community's contribution will not normally exceed 50 % of the total costs of the project. Alternatively, in respect of univeristies and similar organizations, the Community may bear up to 100 % of the marginal costs which are additional to the  normal recurrent costs without the execution of the project.\nSpecific coordinated research projects already launched in the previous programme will be continued in order to promote and intensify cooperation between teams in the various Member States. International cooperation within the projects in Part B  (underground facilities) will be promoted in particular.\nWhere appropriate, shared-cost projects should be carried out by participants from more than one State.\nThe information resulting from the implementation of the shared-cost activities will be made accessible on an equal basis to all Member States. Licences and/or other rights developed in the framework of the programme will be subject to Community rules,  taking account of contractual arrangements. This information will also have to be used for the publication of clear, factual and accurate documents to inform the Community institutions and the public about the main aspects of the technology of  radioactive waste management, which it will then be possible to assess in the more general context of toxic waste management.\n4.\nEvaluation criteria\nThe programme is to be evaluated by independent experts in accordance with the Community plan of action relating to the evaluation of Community research and development activities. The evaluation criteria will include the following:\n- the extent to which research proposals were selected against relevant criteria (scientific, technical or Community interest and cost),\n(\u00b9) Of which about ECU 8,4 million is to cover staff and administration costs.\n- the extent to which substantial development of knowledge, techniques and equipment has resulted from the work supported, taking into account the objectives mentioned above,\n- the potential relevance of the results with regard to safety and protection aspects and in particular with regard to radioactive waste disposal,\n- the potential relevance of the results with regard to radioactive waste management and disposal on an industrial scale,\n- the extent to which information exchange and co-operation across the borders of Member States have been promoted,\n- the programme's contribution to the development of Community policies in the field,\n- the extent to which the programme has avoided duplication of research work,\n- the extent to which the programme has facilitated the supply of information to the general public and the participation of the communities concerned."}
