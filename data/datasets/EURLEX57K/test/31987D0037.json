Purpose of the programme\n- maintenance of fishing capacity throughout the period of application of the programme at the 1982 level, as regards the inshore fleet (cutter fleet), i.e. 23 300 grt and 126 000 hp (position at 31 December 1982), and at the end-1983 level as regards the distant-water fleet, i.e. 55 179 grt and 56 000 hp (position at 31 December 1983). With respect to these target capacities, due to the development in the construction of big cutters which have partially taken over fishing activities of the distant-water fleet, the statistical figures do not satisfactorily reflect this trend,\n- safeguarding the viability of mussel-fishing enterprises.\n2. Areas concerned\nThe programme is applicable to the four coastal Laender: Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein.\n3. Duration\nThe programme is valid from 1 January to 31 December 1986.\n4. Objective of the programme\nThe objective of the programme is to:\n- ensure a high level of profitability for the fishing fleet,\n- safeguard employment,\n- remedy supply shortages,\n- help maintain processing concerns.\n5. The following measures are proposed to attain this objective\n5.1. Construction\nFishing capacity will be maintained by offsetting fleet additions by withdrawals of overall equivalence.\n5.2. Modernization\nModernization projects will mainly consist of work relating to crew safety and comfort and the improvement of on-board working conditions.\n5.3. Shellfish-farming\nModernization of mussel-fishing enterprises by aid for vessel modernization, and provision of aid for the development of oyster-farming.\n6. Estimated investments required to attain the objectives set out in point 4 above and investment-forecasts (million ECU)\n6.1. For vessel construction\n23 construction projects requiring a total planned investment of 16 million ECU.\n6.2. For vessel modernization\n30 modernization projects requiring a total planned investment of 3,6 million ECU.\n6.3. Aquaculture\nModernization and extension of one mussel-farming undertaking and establishment of three oyster-farming undertakings, requiring a total investment of 2,85 million ECU.\nPlanned annual national aid: 3,1 million ECU.\nThe financial data, as well as the breakdown between various measures, are indicative. ANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the extension of the programme for 1986 submitted by the German Government as a framework for Community or national financing schemes constitutes a measure following the adoption of the common fisheries policy, to restructure the fleet to ensure satisfactory economic conditions for the fishing industry, and to improve the incomes to those employed in it.\nHowever, the aim of maintaining fishing capacity at its 1982 level as regards the inshore fleet (cutter fleet), and at its 1983 level as regards the distant-water fleet must be accompanied by a permanent system of management of fishing capacity in association with the management of fish resources.\nThis system will have to involve surveillance of initiatives as regards construction of new vessels and modernization of existing ones, to ensure a balance between additions to and withdrawals from the fleet.\n2. With a view to a clearer understanding of fleet statistics, the Commission requests the German authorities to take into account, in its statistics on the inshore fleet and the distant-water fleet, the development of a category of cutters which have taken over certain tasks of the distant-water fleet.\n3. The Commission requests the German Government to ensure that measures taken by the regional or local authorities are compatible with this programme.\n4. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in this programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community."}
