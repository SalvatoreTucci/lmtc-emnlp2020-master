Article 4(3) and Article 16(3) of the same Regulation lay down that no genetically modified food and feed may be authorised unless it has been adequately and sufficiently demonstrated that it does not have adverse effects on human health, animal health or the environment, that it does not mislead the consumer or the user, and that it does not differ from the food or feed it is intended to replace to such an extent that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for humans or animals.\n(2) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States concerned.\n(3) On 18 August 2006, the authorities of the United States of America informed the Commission that rice products contaminated with the genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 (\u2018the contaminated products\u2019), which have not been authorised for placing on the market in the Community, had been found in rice samples taken on the US market from commercial long-grain rice from the 2005 crop.\n(4) In view of the presumption of risk on products not\u00a0authorised according to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, Commission Decision 2006/578/EC of 23 August 2006 on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised genetically modified organism \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 in rice products\u00a0(3) provisionally banned the placing on the market of the contaminated products. Those emergency measures were confirmed by Commission Decision 2006/601/EC\u00a0(4) which repealed and replaced Decision 2006/578/EC and required Member States not to allow the placing on the market of certain rice products originating from the United States unless the consignment is accompanied by an original analytical report issued by an accredited laboratory attesting that the product does not contain genetically modified rice \u2018LL\u00a0RICE 601\u2019.\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority, requested for scientific support on the issue, issued a statement on 14 September 2006 concluding that although it can be considered that the consumption of imported long grain rice containing trace levels of \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 is not likely to pose an imminent safety concern to humans or animals the available data are insufficient to enable a full safety assessment of the genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 in accordance with the EFSA guidance for risk assessment.\n(6) Checks carried out in the Member States have shown that in addition to the rice products currently referred to in Decision 2006/601/EC other rice products may be contaminated with the genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019. Such products should therefore be included in the scope of Decision 2006/601/EC.\n(7) Checks carried out by Member States have also revealed the presence of genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 in some consignments despite being accompanied by an original analytical report as requested by Decision 2006/601/EC. Contacts initiated thereafter with the US authorities in order to eliminate the risk of presence of unauthorised GM rice have not been successful. In those circumstances, in order to ensure that no contaminated product is placed on the market and in order to guarantee the high level of health protection required in the Community, without imposing restrictions to trade which go beyond what it is necessary, it appears necessary, while maintaining the obligation to issue an analytical report as requested by Decision 2006/601/EC, to provisionally carry out systematic official sampling and analysis of each consignment of specific products originating from the United States before their placing on the market.\n(8) Sampling methodologies play a crucial role in obtaining representative and comparable results; it is therefore appropriate to define a common protocol for sampling and analysis for the control of the absence of the genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019.\n(9) Since the measures provided for in this Decision have an impact on the control resources of the Member States it is appropriate to require that all costs resulting from sampling, analysis and storage and all costs resulting from official measures taken as regards non-compliant consignments are to be borne by the importers or food business operators concerned.\n(10) Those measures should be reviewed within two months in order to assess whether they are still necessary, in the light of their impact and of the practical experience gained on the existing testing requirements.\n(11) Decision 2006/601/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/601/EC is amended as follows:\n1.

It takes in particular into account that the currently available methods are qualitative and that it addresses the detection of a non-authorised GMO for which there is no tolerance threshold. Samples intended for the official control for the absence of LL RICE 601 in rice products shall be taken according to the methods described below. The bulk samples thus obtained shall be considered as representative of the lots from which they are taken.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definitions\nFor the purpose of the current annex, definitions of Recommendation 2004/787/EC apply.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling lots of bulk commodities and preparation of the analytical samples\nThe number of incremental samples for the constitution of the bulk sample and the preparation of the analytical samples shall be made in accordance with Recommendation 2004/787/EC. The size of the laboratory sample shall be 2,5 kg. For the purpose of Article 11(5) of Regulation (EC) 882/2004\u00a0(2), a second laboratory sample shall be constituted.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analysis of the laboratory sample\nThe control laboratory shall take from the homogenised laboratory sample four analytical samples of 240 grams. The four analytical samples have to be ground and further analysed separately.\nThe PCR method to be used is the construct-specific method \u2018P35S:BAR\u2019 that has been developed by Bayer CropScience and verified by the USDA and the JRC in its quality of Community reference laboratory for GM Food and Feed. In case of positive results, the presence of LL RICE 601 shall be confirmed by the event-specific method.\nThe lot shall be considered to be positive when one of the four analytical samples is positive.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 348, 24.11.2004, p. 18.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 28.5.2004, p. 1."}
