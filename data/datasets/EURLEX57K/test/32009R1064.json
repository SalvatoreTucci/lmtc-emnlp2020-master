This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(7).\n(4) Due to the particularities involved in the transfer from one management system to another, Article 308c(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should not apply to the tariff period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010.\n(5) Article 166 of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code)\u00a0(8) provides for the customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their specific use. It should be ensured that malting barley imported under this tariff quota is designed to be used for producing beer aged in vats containing beechwood, in accordance with the Community\u2019s international commitments.\n(6) Provision needs to be made for a high level of security in order to ensure the sound management of the tariff and to maintain such security throughout processing.\n(7) Taking into account the specific nature of the barley imported from the United States of America under this quota, the amount of the security in respect of imports which are accompanied by a compliance certificate agreed upon with the United States Government, in accordance with the administrative co-operation procedure provided for in Articles 63, 64 and 65 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, should be reduced.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 1215/2008 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation. However, it would be expedient to continue to apply Regulation (EC) No 1215/2008 to the import licences issued for the import quota periods prior to those covered by this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation opens a tariff import quota of 50\u00a0000 tonnes for malting barley falling under CN code 1003\u00a000 to be used for the production of beer aged in vats containing beechwood.
