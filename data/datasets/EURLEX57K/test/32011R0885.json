The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0107/2010\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 15 March 2011\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment, and that the use of this preparation can improve the zootechnical performance of the animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation enters into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 September 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 36, 9.2.2010, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(3):2114.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
