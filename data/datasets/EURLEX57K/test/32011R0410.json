Consequently, the Court declared that the relevant provisions are invalid. Since it is in the interest of natural persons that their personal data should be protected, and with a view to reconciling the different objectives underlying the obligation to publish information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 259/2008\u00a0(3), it should be stipulated that this obligation does not apply to natural persons.\n(2) For reasons of transparency, Regulation (EC) No 259/2008 should therefore be formally amended accordingly pending the adoption by Parliament and the Council of new rules taking account of the objections expressed by the Court.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 259/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) the opening sentence is replaced by the following:\n(b) point (a) is deleted;\n(c) points (b) and (c) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) the full legal name as registered where the beneficiaries are legal persons with an autonomous legal personality pursuant to the legislation of the Member State concerned;\n(c) the full name of the association as registered or otherwise officially recognised where the beneficiaries are associations of legal persons without an own legal personality;\u2019;\n2. paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of 9 November 2010 in Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09, Volker und Markus Schecke GbR and Hartmut Eifert v Land Hessen, not yet published in the ECR.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 76, 19.3.2008, p. 28."}
