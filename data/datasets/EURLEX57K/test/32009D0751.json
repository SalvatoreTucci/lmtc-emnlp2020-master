Seventeen of those establishments are allowed to receive and process compliant and non-compliant raw milk without separation. They should therefore be included in the list of Chapter\u00a0I of the Appendix to Annex\u00a0VI. One milk-processing establishment currently listed in Chapter I will process only compliant raw milk and will therefore be considered as an EU-approved milk-processing establishment. That establishment should therefore be deleted from the list of Chapter\u00a0I of the Appendix to Annex\u00a0VI. Two milk-processing establishments currently listed in Chapter II will process only compliant raw milk. These establishments should therefore be deleted from the list of Chapter II of the appendix to Annex VI.\n(3) The Appendix to Annex\u00a0VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Appendix to Annex\u00a0VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\nANNEX\nAppendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended as follows:\n1. in Chapter I the following entries are added:\nNo Veterinary No Name of the establishment Town/Street or village/Region\n\u201848 BG 1012020 ET \u201cPetar Mitov-Universal\u201d s.
