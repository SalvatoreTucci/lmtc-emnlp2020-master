The reserve for loan guarantees has been replaced in the financial framework 2007-2013 of the 2006 Interinstitutional Agreement by a budget line under heading 4 \u2018the EU as a global player\u2019. The main principles regarding the reserve for Emergency Aid are laid down in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(7), while the amount and the conditions for utilisation are set out in the 2006 Interinstitutional Agreement.
