whereas Council Regulation  (EEC) No 2169/81 of 27 July 1981 laying down the general rules for the system of aid for cotton (4)  should accordingly be amended; whereas the significance of the adjustments that need to be made to  Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81 and the large number of amendments already made to it make it  appropriate to recast this Regulation for the purposes of clarity and transparence; whereas  Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81 should therefore be repealed;\nWhereas, pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Protocol, it is necessary to lay down the rules of  procedure and sound management for its application, the general rules of the system of production  aid, the criteria for determining the world market price and the rules concerning the financing of  the measures envisaged;\nWhereas, in order to facilitate the management and control of the aid system, provision should be  made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission  within a Management Committee; whereas it is advisable to use the Management Committee for Flax and  Hemp as provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 of 29 June 1970 on the common  organization of the market in flax and hemp (5);\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87, the aid shall be altered by  adjustments yet to be determined where the Community production exceeds a quantity fixed in  advance; whereas, in consequence, the amount of aid to be granted cannot be determined until the  actual quantity produced is itself known; whereas, to offset the adverse effects of late payment of  aid for the parties involved, provision should be made for the part of the aid to be paid in  advance;\nWhereas, pursuant to the third subparagraph of paragraph 3 of the Protocol, the aid is determined  on the basis of the difference between a guide price for unginned cotton and the world market  price; whereas, since there is no international trade in unginned cotton, and there are therefore  no offers or quotations, provision should be made to enable a world market price for this product  to be determined; whereas this price may be established on the basis of the historical relationship  between the price agreed for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton;\nWhereas, when calculating the price of ginned cotton, account should be taken of the offers made on  the world market and of the quotations on those exchanges that are important for international  trade; whereas the price on the world market must be calculated using the most favourable offers  and quotations on that market among those that are considered representative of the real market  trend;\nWhereas, for the aid system to operate correctly, the world market price must be recorded for a  Community frontier crossing point; whereas, in fixing this point, account should be taken of the  extent to which it is representative for imports of the products in question; whereas, therefore,  in the case of multiple origins the ports of Northern Europe should be chosen and in the case of a  limited number of origins, offers or quotations recorded on an exchange outside Europe the port of   Piraeus should be chosen, whereas, in the latter case the offers and quotations adopted will need  to be adjusted if they relate to some other frontier crossing point;\nWhereas such adjustments should also be made to the offers and quotations adopted in order to  compensate for any variation from the presentation and quality taken as a basis for fixing the  guide price;\nWhereas the producer Member States should be required to set up the control arrangements necessary  to ensure that the aid system operates correctly;\nWhereas, with a view to subjecting the Community expenditure on applying the planned measure to  financial and monetary rules and appropriate procedures, Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21  April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), should apply mutatis mutandis to  the matters dealt with herein, as should the Regulations relating to the value of the unit of  account and the exchange rates to be applied within the framework of the common agricultural  policy;\nWhereas the provisions of this Regulation should apply as from the 1995/96 marketing year so that  the adjustments to the system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1553/95 may be implemented by that  date;\nWhereas the adjustments to the system as laid down in this Regulation must be implemented as  smoothly as possible; whereas provisional measures may therefore be necessary,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a) 'unginned cotton` means the fruit of the cotton plant Gossypium) which has reached maturity and  has been harvested, and which contains pod waste, leaves and earthy matter;\n(b) 'ginned cotton` means the cotton fibres (other than linters and waste), neither carded nor  combed, from which the seeds and most of the pod waste, leaves and earthy matter have been  removed.", "The guide price for unginned cotton of a specified quality shall remain applicable  throughout a given marketing year;

Entitlement to the aid shall be acquired when the cotton is ginned. However, aid may be paid in  advance from 16 October following the start of the marketing year when the unginned cotton enters  the cotton ginning undertaking, provided that an adequate security has been lodged.
