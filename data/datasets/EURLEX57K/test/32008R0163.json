That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns a request for authorisation of the preparation Lanthanum carbonate octahydrate (Lantharenol), as a feed additive for cats, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 18 September 2007 that the preparation Lanthanum carbonate octahydrate (Lantharenol) does not have adverse effect on animal health or the environment and does not pose concerns for human health relative to incidental exposure to the additive\u00a0(2). It further concluded that that preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. Lantharenol has shown to decrease the phosphorus excretion via urine. The opinion of the Authority does not recommend appropriate measures for user safety. It considers that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring to recognise any long-term adverse effects in cats. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018other zootechnical additives\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
