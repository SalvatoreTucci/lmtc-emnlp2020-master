The application was lodged by Greenwood Houseware (Zuhai) Ltd (the applicant), an exporting producer in the People\u2019s Republic of China (the country concerned).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(2) The product under review is ironing boards, whether or not free-standing, with or without a steam soaking and/or heating top and/or blowing top, including sleeve boards, and essential parts thereof, i.e. the legs, the top and the iron rest originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN codes ex\u00a03924\u00a090\u00a090, ex\u00a04421\u00a090\u00a098, ex\u00a07323\u00a093\u00a090, ex\u00a07323\u00a099\u00a091, ex\u00a07323\u00a099\u00a099, ex\u00a08516\u00a079\u00a070 and ex\u00a08516\u00a090\u00a000.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2007\u00a0(2), under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the product concerned produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive antidumping duty of 38,1\u00a0% with the exception of several companies expressly mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. It further alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e., the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures.\n(5) The applicant further alleges that it began exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given and opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.\n(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. Upon receipt of the claim mentioned below under 8(c), it will be determined whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. If so, the applicant\u2019s individual margin of dumping shall be calculated and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject shall be determined.\n(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 452/2007.\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(c) Market economy treatment/individual treatment\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n(a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation;\n(b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(14) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade.
