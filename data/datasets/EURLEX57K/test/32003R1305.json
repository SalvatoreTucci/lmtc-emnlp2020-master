As a result of changes made by the latter to Regulation (EC) No 2366/2002, Namibia also has access, with effect from 1 January 2003, to the GATT-WTO non-country-specific tariff quota for the group 5 countries in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 285/2003(7) was adopted before the introduction of these changes and provides only for the issue of import licences for products falling within CN code ex 0204 originating in Namibia in the context of the group 4 countries.\n(2) Applications were lodged between 1 and 10 January 2003 in Greece and Italy for products falling within CN code 0204 originating in Namibia. Regulation (EC) No 1302/2003 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 provides that applications for import licences accepted for the first quarter of 2003 under the GATT-WTO non-country-specific tariff quota must include applications for import licences for products falling within CN code 0204 originating in Namibia on the same conditions as laid down in Articles 1 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 285/2003 for imports of products originating in South Africa. The same Regulation stipulates that the Commission is to authorise, before 26 July 2003, the issue of import licences for the first quarter of 2003 in respect of applications lodged between 1 and 10 January 2003 in respect of products falling within CN code 0204 originating in Namibia.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 285/2003 should be amended accordingly and provide that quantities applied for in Greece and Italy between 1 and 10 January 2003 in respect of products falling within CN code 0204 originating in Namibia should be assigned to group 5 with the same acceptance coefficient as for the other origins (38,6599 %), and the balance allocated to group 4 with an acceptance coefficient of 100 %.\n(4) It should be recalled that repayment of import duties overcharged for products originating in Namibia and falling within groups 4 and 5, following this amendment of Regulation (EC) No 285/2003, imported under licences issued for the first quarter of 2003 is to be carried out in accordance with Articles 878 to 898 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 881/2003(9),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 285/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
