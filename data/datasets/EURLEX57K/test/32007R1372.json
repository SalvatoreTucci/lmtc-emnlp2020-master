In this regard, the advantages of having data on wages by deciles in relation to other employment characteristics are widely recognised.\n(4) The Community Labour Force Survey is essentially the first and most authoritative reference source for labour market information in the European Union, and information on wages, as a fundamental variable to explain labour market behaviour, should be a standard element of this survey in order to allow for a more complete analysis of labour markets.\n(5) The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(2), has been consulted in accordance with Article\u00a03 of that Decision.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0577/98\u00a0(3) should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0577/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1) in Article\u00a04(1), point\u00a0(l) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(l) wages from the main job;\u2019\n2) Article\u00a06 shall be replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 23\u00a0October 2007.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
