The current division of responsibilities and the decision-making procedures should be redesigned.\n(3) With a view to the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, full account should be taken of the implementation of EURES in the acceding countries while ensuring that the system remains efficient and manageable.\n(4) The opportunities afforded by the emerging information and communication technology tools for further enhancing and rationalising the services provided should also be taken into account.\n(5) To this end, EURES should be consolidated and strengthened as a key tool for the monitoring of mobility, for the support of the free movement of workers and the integration of the European labour markets, and for informing citizens about the relevant Community legislation.\n(6) There is a need to underpin occupational and geographic mobility in line with the European Employment Strategy, in the interests of implementing the Action Plan for skills and mobility(4) and the Council Resolution of 3 June 2002 on the same issue(5).\n(7) For the sake of clarity, it is advisable to re-establish the European Employment Services network whilst defining more precisely its composition, constitution and functions.
