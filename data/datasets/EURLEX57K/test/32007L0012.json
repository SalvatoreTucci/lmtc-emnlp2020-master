Such authorisations have to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\n(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\n(3) MRLs for pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC are to be kept under review and may be modified to take account of new or changed uses. Information about new or changed uses has been communicated to the Commission which will lead to changes in the residue levels of penconazole, benomyl and carbendazim.\n(4) The lifetime exposure of consumers to those pesticides via food products that may contain residues of those pesticides, has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(3).\n(5) In the case of benomyl and carbendazim for which an acute reference dose (ARfD) exists, the acute exposure of consumers via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee on Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides\u00a0(4), have been taken into account. Based on the dietary intake assessment, the MRLs for those pesticides should be fixed so as to ensure that the ARfD will not be exceeded. In the case of the other substances, an assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short term assessment is not needed.\n(6) In the case of the new MRL on citrus for benomyl and carbendazim the applicant has undertaken to supply additional data required by December 2007. The data already available show that the proposed MRL is safe for the consumers.\n(7) Where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data, MRLs should be fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new MRLs for those pesticides.\n(9) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 27 August 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive, They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 28 August 2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Member States adopt the provisions referred to in paragraph 1, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
