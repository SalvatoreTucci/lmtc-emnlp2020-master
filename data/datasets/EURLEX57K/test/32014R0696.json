Erucic acid is a natural plant toxin which is a contaminant according to the definition of the contaminant provided in Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 as the presence of erucic acid in food is the result of the agricultural production, more in particular the choice of the variety. To simplify the legislation, it is appropriate to establish the maximum level for erucic acid in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006. Furthermore it is appropriate to harmonise the provisions for foodstuffs with a fat content equal or less than 5 %. Directive 76/621/EEC shall then be repealed subsequently by a self-standing legal act.\n(3) The appropriateness of a maximum level for erucic acid has been highlighted by the Scientific Committee on Food in its opinion expressed on 17 September 1993 on essential requirements for infant formulae and follow-on formulae\u00a0(4).\n(4) A stricter maximum level for erucic acid in infant formulae and follow-on formulae has been established by Commission Directive 2006/141/EC\u00a0(5); it is appropriate to indicate this maximum level also in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, the following Section 8 \u2018Inherent plant toxins\u2019 is added.\n\u2018Section 8: Inherent plant toxins\nFoodstuffs (1) Maximum levels (g/kg)\n8.1 Erucic acid\n8.1.1 Vegetable oils and fats 50\u00a0(6)\n8.1.2 Foods containing added vegetable oils and fats with the exception of the foods referred to in 8.1.3 50\u00a0(6)\n8.1.3 Infant formulae and follow-on formulae (8) 10\u00a0(6)", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a037, 13.2.1993, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0364, 20.12.2006, p.\u00a05).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 76/621/EEC of 20 July 1976 relating to the fixing of the maximum level of erucic acid in oils and fats intended as such for human consumption and in foodstuffs containing added oils and fats (OJ L\u00a0202, 28.7.1976, p.\u00a035).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_34.pdf\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive 1999/21/EC (OJ L\u00a0401, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0the maximum level refers to the level of erucic acid, calculated on the total level of fatty acids in the fat component in food.\u2019"}
