whereas similar detailed rules of application should therefore be laid down for a quantity of 89 000 calves for the period 1 January to 30 June 1998;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas, in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported or imported during 1997 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the Member State in which the operator is registered in the national VAT register;\nWhereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1998;\nWhereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences; whereas, to this end, rules should be set on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1404/97 (7), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2469/97 (9); whereas, moreover, it should be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied;\nWhereas the security for import licences under the said quota should be updated and fixed at ECU 5 per head;\nWhereas the competent authorities issuing the import licences are not always aware of the origin of the animals imported under the quota in question; whereas that information is important for statistical reasons; whereas, therefore, importers should be obliged to indicate the country of origin next to the quantities in question on the reverse of the import licence;\nWhereas Protocol 4 annexed to the Europe Agreements and Protocol 3 annexed to the Free-Trade Agreements have been amended; whereas the new Protocols provide that the proof of origin of animals imported into the Community may be established by a declaration by the exporter under certain conditions or by presentation of an EUR.1 certificate; whereas, therefore, new provisions governing release for free circulation of the animals imported under this Regulation should be introduced;\nWhereas the provisions of this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["With the exception of imports under tariff quotas for the importation of 169 000 young male bovine animals for fattening and 153 000 live bovine animals weighing between 80 and 300 kilograms, imports into the Community of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 21, 0102 90 29, 0102 90 41 and 0102 90 49 and referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (10), originating in the countries listed in Annex I, shall be subject to the management measures laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
