Article 10(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 10(1) to (4) thereof sets out specific provisions for the evaluation of products used in the Union as silage additives at the date that Regulation became applicable.\n(2) In accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the preparations of Pediococcus pentosaceus DSM 14021, Pediococcus pentosaceus DSM 23688, Pediococcus pentosaceus DSM 23689 were entered in the Register of Feed Additives as existing products belonging to the functional group of silage additives, for all animal species.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, applications were submitted for the authorisation of those preparations as feed additives for all animal species, requesting those additives to be classified in the category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and in the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019. Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 18 June 2013\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the use of the strains in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed with the treated silage and for the environment. The Authority also concluded that all three preparations have the potential to improve the production of silage by reducing the pH and increasing the lactic acid concentration, resulting in an increased preservation of dry matter in easy and moderately difficult to ensile forage. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparations concerned shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparations specified in the Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Transitional measures\nThe preparations specified in the Annex and feed containing them, which are produced and labelled before 20 August 2014 in accordance with the rules applicable before 20 February 2014 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(7):3284.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of fresh material\nCategory of technological additives.
