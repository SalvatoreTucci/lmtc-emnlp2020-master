EFSA recommends, inter alia, to strengthen the process hygiene criterion for Salmonella on pig carcases.\n(3) In order to reduce the Salmonella prevalence on pig carcases, the control on hygiene during slaughter should be strengthened in accordance with the provisions in Commission Regulation (EU) No 218/2014 of 7 March 2014 amending Annexes to Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005\u00a0(4) and consequently the number of positive samples should be reduced.\n(4) The requirements provided for in the Regulation involve the adaptation of current practices for food business operators. It is therefore appropriate to allow a delayed application of this Regulation.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005, row 2.1.4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.1.4 Carcases of pigs\n\u20182.1.4 Carcases of pigs\nIt shall apply from 1 June 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 226, 25.6.2004, p. 3.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 338, 22.12.2005, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(10):2351.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See page 95 of this Official Journal."}
