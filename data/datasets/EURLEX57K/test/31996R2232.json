To be able to assess the possible harmful effects of a flavouring substance, the latter must be subjected to appropriate toxicological evaluation. When a flavouring substance contains or consists of a genetically modified organism within the meaning of Article 2 (1) and (2) of Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), Articles 11 to 18 will not be applicable. However, the evaluation of the safety of this flavouring substance must take into account environmental safety as provided for in the said Directive.\n3. All flavouring substances must be kept constantly monitored and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary.\n(1) OJ No L 117, 8. 5. 1991, p. 15.
