The analysis is conducted on the aliquot portion of colza seeds separated from impurities other than Sinapis arvensis seeds.\n2. Two samples, of 5 g, weighed with an exactitude of 0.001 g, are placed separately in the sieve with a mesh of circular holes of 1.8 mm diameter.\nThe seeds which pass through the sieve are weighed, and the weight noted.\n3. The filter paper is shaped to fit the bottom of the containers to be used and placed in the latter ; the solution of 5 % KOH, prepared immediately before use in the test in order to avoid carbonization, is poured over the filter paper to moisten it. The excess liquid is removed.\n4. The seeds which have passed through the sieve are deposited on the filter paper - the pneumatic or electronic counter may be used to do this - and their number noted. During this operation, damaged seeds should be removed as they can cause a pale blue fluorescence.\nWhen the seeds have been deposited, the lids should be placed on the plastic containers to avoid evaporation, as this could affect the results. Leave for 45 minutes at 20 \u0e22\u0e1aC.\n5. The seeds are observed under an ultra-violet lamp emitting a light of 365 to 366 n.m.\nThe Sinapis arvensis seeds will display a greenish-yellow luminous fluorescence. Colza seeds provoke no fluorescence (apart from the exception noted in point 4).\nThe Sinapis arvensis seeds are counted and their number noted.\n6. Calculation of the Sinapis arvensis seed content in the colza seed.      (a) Calculate the number of Sinapis arvensis seeds as a percentage (S) of the total number of seeds deposited on the filter paper.\n(b) The quantity (K) in grammes of Sinapis arvensis seeds in the sample analysed (5 g) is obtained by applying the following formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0007778\">\nwhere T = weight in grammes of seeds which pass through the sieve (point 2). The quantity in grammes (X) of Sinapis arvensis seeds contained in the original sample is obtained by applying the following formula:  >PIC FILE= \"T0007779\">\nwhere Ma = the weight of the original sample of colza seed separated from the fines (M1) and impurities (M2a + M3a) as recorded in accordance with Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1470/68, and M5 = the weight of the sample of approximately 5 g.\n(c) The percentage (Y) of the quantity in grammes (X) of Sinapis arvensis in the original sample is calculated by applying the following formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0007780\">\nwhere Mo = the quantity in grammes of the original test portion.\n7. The provisions relating to repeatability laid down in point 6.2 of Annex IV shall be applicable.\""}
