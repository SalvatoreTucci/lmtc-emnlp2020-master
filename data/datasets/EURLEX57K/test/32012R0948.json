The aim of that system is to trace the exports concerned and detect cases where the refund is not due and must be recovered.\n(2) As mentioned in recital 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1180/2008 the application of that Regulation will have to be evaluated after a significant period of operation. The Commission has evaluated the application of Regulation (EC) No 1180/2008 and has reached the conclusion that due to repetitive technical problems which could not be solved satisfactorily, the system of communication of information has not reached the level of performance required for being an efficient tool against undue payment of export refund. In addition, the voluntary use of the system by exporters has decreased considerably over the years.\n(3) Therefore the system of communication of information established by Regulation (EC) No 1180/2008 should be abolished and Regulation (EC) No 1180/2008 should be repealed.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Repeal\nRegulation (EC) No 1180/2008 is repealed.", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 December 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 October 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 319, 29.11.2008, p. 44."}
