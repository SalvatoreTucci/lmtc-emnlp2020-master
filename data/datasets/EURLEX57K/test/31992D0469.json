Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Klassificeringscenter' ('KC').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with nine probes of six millimetres each containing a photodiode (Siemens SFH 950-LD242 II) and a photodetector (Siemens SFH 960-PB 103) and having an operating distance of between one and 180 millimetres.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated on the basis of 10 measurements taken from seven measuring-points as are indicated in paragraph 4 and according to the following formulae:\n(a) carcases with skin on:\nY  = 62,7200   0,2271x1   0,0430x2   0,1614x3   0,1467x4   0,1623x5   0,2062x6   0,1574x7 + 0,0621x8 + 0,0299x9 + 0,0384x10 + 0,0706x11\n(b) dehided carcases:\nY  = 58,4049   0,0380x1   0,0304x2   0,1660x3   0,1741x4   0,1819x5   0,1809x6   0,1722x7 + 0,0513x8 + 0,0522x9 + 0,0394x10 + 0,0440x11\nwhere:\nY  = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase.\n4. The measurement points are:\nx1  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured at the centre of the third cervical vertebra, at 10,5 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x2  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured at the centre of the fourth cervical  vertebra, at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x3  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured between the fourth and fifth hindmost thoracic vertebrae, at 3 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x4  = the thickness of backfat (1) in  millimetres, measured between the second and third hindmost thoracic vertebrae, at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x5  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured between the first lumbar vertebra and the last thoracic vertebra, at 6  cm off the midline of the carcase,  x6  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured 4 cm before the fore edge of the pubic bone, at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x7  = the thickness of backfat (1) in millimetres, measured at the fore  edge of the pubic bone, at 11 cm from midline of the carcase,  x8  = muscle thickness in millimetres, measured between the fourth and fifth hindmost thoracic vertebrae, at 3 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x9  = muscle thickness in millimetres,  measured between the second and third hindmost thoracic vertebrae, at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase,  x10  = muscle thickness in millimetres, measured between the first lumbar vertebra and the hindmost thoracic vertebra, at 6 cm off the midline of  the carcase,  x11  = warm carcase weight in kilograms (excluding flare fat, kidneys and diaphragm).\nThe formulae shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 100 kilograms.\nPART 2\nFat-O-Meater/Manuel Klassificering (FOM/MK)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater/Manuel Klassificering' ('FOM/MK')\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of six millimetres diameter containing a photodiode (Siemens SFH 950-LD 242 II) and a photodetector (Siemens SFH 960-BP 103) and having an operating distance of between one and 94 millimetres.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formulae:\n(a) carcases with skin on:\nY  = 61,2548   0,3724x1   0,3702x2 + 0,1337x3 + 0,0356x4;\n(b) dehided carcases:\nY  = 60,0   0,4288x1   0,3619x2 + 0,1792x3;\nwhere:\nY  = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,  x1  = the thickness of backfat (2) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last lumbar vertebrae,  x2  = the thickness of backfat (1)  in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,  x3  = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2  x4  = warm carcase weight in kilograms  (excluding the flare fat, the kidneys and the diaphragm).\nThe formulae shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 100 kilograms.\nPART 3\nUltra-FOM\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Ultra-FOM'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 4 Mhz (Krautkraemer MB 4 SE). The ultrasonic signal is digitized, stored and processed by a microprocessor (type Intel 80 C 31).\nThe results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the Ultra-FOM apparatus itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formulae:\nY  = 63,8662   0,4465x1   0,5096x2 + 0,1281x3;\nwhere:\nY  = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,  x1  = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last lumbar vertebrae,  x2  = the thickness of  backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,  x3  = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formulae  shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 100 kilograms.\n(1) Including rind in the case of carcases with skin on.
