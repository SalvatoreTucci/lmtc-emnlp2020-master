Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/28/EC (OJ L 90, 8.4.2003, p. 45).\nANNEX I\nANNEX II\nINFRINGEMENTS\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following non-exhaustive list, classified into three risk categories (Category I being the most serious), gives a guideline on what is to be regarded as infringement.\nThe determination of the appropriate risk category must take account of the particular circumstances and be left to the discretion of the enforcing body/officer at the roadside.\nFailures that are not listed under the risk categories shall be classified according to the descriptions of the categories.\nIn the event there are several infringements per transport unit, only the most serious risk category (as indicated under item 39 in Annex I to this Directive) shall be applied for reporting purposes (Annex III to this Directive).\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Category I\nWhere failure to comply with relevant ADR provisions creates a high-level risk of death, serious personal injury or significant damage to the environment such failures would normally lead to taking immediate and appropriate corrective measures such as immobilisation of the vehicle.\nFailures are:\n1. The dangerous goods being carried are prohibited for transport\n2. Leakage of dangerous substances\n3. Carriage by a prohibited mode or an inappropriate means of transport\n4. Carriage in bulk in a container which is not structurally serviceable\n5. Carriage in a vehicle without an appropriate certificate of approval\n6. Vehicle no longer complies with the approval standards and presents an immediate danger (otherwise it goes in risk category II)\n7. Non-approved packaging is used\n8. Packaging does not conform to the applicable packing instruction\n9. The special provisions for mixed packing have not been complied with\n10. The rules governing the securing and stowage of the load have not been complied with\n11. The rules governing mixed loading of packages have not been complied with\n12. The permissible degrees of filling of tanks or packages have not been complied with\n13. The provisions limiting the quantities carried in one transport unit have not been complied with\n14.

Carriage without any placarding and marking on the vehicle\n16. Information relevant to the substance being carried enabling determination of a risk category I offence is missing (e.g. UN number, proper shipping name, packing group)\n17. Driver does not hold a valid vocational training certificate\n18. Fire or an unprotected light is being used\n19. The ban on smoking is not being observed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Category II\nWhere failure to comply with relevant ADR provisions creates a risk of personal injury or damage to the environment such failures would normally lead to taking appropriate corrective measures such as requiring rectification at the site of control if possible and appropriate, but at the completion of the current transport movement at the latest.\nFailures are:\n1. The transport unit comprises more than one trailer/semi-trailer\n2. Vehicle no longer complies with the approval standards but does not present an immediate danger\n3. The vehicle is not carrying operational fire extinguishers as required; a fire extinguisher can still be deemed operational if only the prescribed seal and/or the expiry date are missing; however, this does not apply if the fire extinguisher is visibly no longer operational, e.g. pressure gauge at 0\n4. The vehicle does not carry the equipment required in the ADR or in the instructions in writing\n5. Test and inspection dates and use periods of packaging, IBCs or large packaging have not been complied with\n6. Packages with damaged packaging, IBCs or large packaging or damaged uncleaned empty packaging are being carried\n7. Carriage of packaged goods in a container which is not structurally serviceable\n8. Tanks/tank containers (including ones that are empty and uncleaned) have not been closed properly\n9. Carriage of a combination packaging with an outer packaging which is not closed properly\n10. Incorrect labelling, marking or placarding\n11. There are no instructions in writing conforming to the ADR, or the instructions in writing are not relevant to the goods carried\n12. The vehicle is not properly supervised or parked.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Category III\nWhere failure to comply with relevant provisions result in a low level of risk of personal injury or damage to the environment and where appropriate corrective measures do not need to be taken at the roadside but can be addressed at a later date at the undertaking.\nFailures are:\n1. The size of placards or labels or the size of letters, figures or symbols on placards or labels does not comply with the regulations\n2. Information in the transport documentation other than that in risk category I/(16) is not available\n3. The training certificate is not on board the vehicle but there is evidence that the driver holds it.\nANNEX III\nMODEL STANDARD FORM FOR THE REPORT TO BE SENT TO THE COMMISSION CONCERNING INFRINGEMENTS AND PENALTIES"}
