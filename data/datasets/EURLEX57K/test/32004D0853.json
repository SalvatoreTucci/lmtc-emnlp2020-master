The border between the two States is inside the tunnel but it would be impractical to arrange collection of tolls inside. The first indent of Article 3(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC stipulates that the \u2018\u2026 \u201cterritory of a Member State\u201d shall mean the territory of the country \u2026\u2019. Under the current rules, therefore, the taxable amount of the tolls should be related to the length of the tunnel which belongs to each State. Since it would be expensive and disruptive to have a toll booth at each end of the tunnel for each Member State to collect their share of the toll, tolls are collected as a whole at the entrance of the tunnel. Each journey through the tunnel should be invoiced with two tolls and two different VAT rates: one for the French territory and one for the Italian territory. Moreover the taxable amount and the VAT should afterwards be shared between the two Member States. Thus the VAT is an additional complicating factor in an already complex mechanism of financial compensation resulting from the sharing of the management costs for the tunnel.\n(5) The purpose of the derogation requested by France and Italy is to seek authorisation to derogate from Article 3 of Directive 77/388/EEC in relation to the tunnel of Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) and tunnel of Fr\u00e9jus.\n(6) For both tunnels the two States wish to consider the entire length of the carriageway within the tunnel as the territory of the State in which any transit journey through the tunnel using the carriageway starts. Thus the French office will apply French VAT to the entire toll for all journeys starting from the French side. The same mechanism will be applied by the Italian office to all journeys starting from the Italian side.\n(7) This derogation only has effect with regard to the charging of tolls and in order to simplify the way in which VAT is calculated and accounted for. It does not affect the VAT territory of Italy or France for the purposes of any other supplies.\n(8) The intended measure is designed to solve the problems outlined above by simplifying the arrangements for paying the tax and is essentially of a technical nature. It does not adversely affect the Communities' own resources provided from VAT, nor does it have any effect on the amount of the tax due at the final stage of consumption.\n(9) As the matter involved is the territory definition for VAT purposes to which there should be no changes, the requested derogation should be granted for an indefinite period,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 3 of Directive 77/388/EEC, France and Italy are hereby authorised to consider the carriageway within the tunnels of Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) and Fr\u00e9jus, for their entire length, as part of the territory of the Member State from which any journey using the carriageway starts.", "Article 1 shall apply to the tunnels' tolls only.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic and the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
