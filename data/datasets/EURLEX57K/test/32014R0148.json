Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with effect of 1 January 2014.\n(2) In accordance with point A (II) of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 category A, C and E of the Union scale for the classification of carcasses of bovine animals cover respectively carcasses of uncastrated males, castrated males and female animals aged from 12 months to less than 24 months. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 added a new category Z to that classification that covers carcasses of animals aged from 8 months to less than 12 months. In view of that, it is necessary to adapt the categories and classes in relation to which national and Union market prices in the beef sector are to be recorded pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008.\n(3) As regards the Union scale for the classification of pig carcasses, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 introduced class S for lean meat content of 60\u00a0% or more of carcass weight as an obligatory class and reserved class E for lean meat content of more than 55\u00a0% but less than 60\u00a0% of carcass weight. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the provision in Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 on the basis of which the market prices for pig carcasses in Member States are to be determined.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 14(1) is replaced by the following:\n(a) carcasses of animals aged from 8 months to less than 12 months: U2, U3, R2, R3, O2, O3;\n(b) carcasses of uncastrated male animals aged from 12 months to less than 24 months: U2, U3, R2, R3, O2, O3;\n(c) carcasses of uncastrated male animals aged from 24 months: R3;\n(d) carcasses of castrated male animals aged from 12 months: U2, U3, U4, R3, R4, O3, O4;\n(e) carcasses of female animals that have calved: R3, R4, O2, O3, O4, P2, P3;\n(f) carcasses of other female animals aged from 12 months: U2, U3, R2, R3, R4, O2, O3, O4.\n(2) Article 25(2) is replaced by the following:\n(a) carcasses 60 to less than 120\u00a0kg: E, S;\n(b) carcasses 120 to less than 180\u00a0kg: R\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof (OJ L 337, 16.12.2008, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671.\u2019"}
