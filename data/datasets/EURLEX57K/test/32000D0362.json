The appearance of the disease represents a serious danger to the Community pig herd. With a view to the speedy eradication of the disease the Community is able to contribute to expenditure incurred by the Member State.\n(2) On 22 June 1998 the Netherlands presented an application for reimbursement of all the expenditure incurred in the country in 1997. This application was replaced by a new application lodged on 2 June 1999.\n(3) The Commission adopted Decisions 98/25/EC(3) and 1999/18/EC(4) on Community financial aid towards the eradication of classical swine fever in the Netherlands. These Decisions provided for the payment of two initial advances amounting to EUR 74429868.\n(4) The total amount of Community aid must now be fixed.\n(5) The Commission has checked to see whether all Community veterinary rules have been observed and all the conditions for Community financial assistance have been met.\n(6) As a result of these checks, not all of the expenditure submitted could be accepted as eligible.
