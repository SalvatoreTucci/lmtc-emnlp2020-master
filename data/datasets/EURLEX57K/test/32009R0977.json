Where annual \u2018Boerenkaas\u2019 production in an undertaking is below 25\u00a0000 kilograms, the checks are carried out twice a year. These changes are proposed to prevent the small undertakings being faced with high control costs.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

The fat content of \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d varies depending on the fat content of the milk used.\nThe cheese may contain cumin or other seeds, herbs and/or spices. The older the cheese becomes and the longer it ripens, the firmer and drier it becomes, thus producing hard cheese.\nExamples of names of products are \u201cGoudse Boerenkaas\u201d, \u201cGoudse Boerenkaas met kruiden\u201d, \u201cEdammer Boerenkaas\u201d, \u201cLeidse Boerenkaas\u201d, \u201cBoerenkaas van geitenmelk\u201d and \u201cBoerenkaas van schapenmelk\u201d.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the production method of the agricultural product or foodstuff to which the name under point 3.1 applies (Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1216/2007)\nThe raw material used may be:\n(a) raw milk;\n(b) cream or fully or partially skimmed milk obtained directly from the milk referred to in point (a);\n(c) water.\nThe milk used must not have undergone heat treatment above 40\u00a0\u00b0C; the phosphatase activity must be compatible with that of the raw milk used.\nThe milk must be processed into cheese within 40 hours of milking.\nAuxiliary materials and additives:\n(a) cultures of microorganisms forming lactic acid, propionic acid and aromas (not genetically modified);\n(b) rennet (within the meaning of Article 5(a) of the Dairy Products (Commodities Act) Decree);\n(c) calcium chloride;\n(d) sodium nitrate;\n(e) seeds, herbs and/or spices;\n(f) sodium chloride (through soaking in brine).\nManufacturing process\n\u2014 The raw milk is curdled at a temperature of approximately 30\u00a0\u00b0C within 40 hours of milking.\n\u2014 A mixed strain culture of lactic acid bacteria brings about acidification.\n\u2014 After cutting, stirring and draining off part of the whey, the whey and curd mixture is washed once or twice with hot water, raising the temperature of the mixture to no more than 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\u2014 After processing, the curd is placed in cheese moulds.\n\u2014 Before or during pressing a casein mark is put on the cheese bearing the name \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d, and possibly also the name of the type of milk.\n\u2014 After pressing and acidification over a number of hours, the cheese is soaked in a brine solution of 18 to 22\u00a0% common salt (sodium chloride).\n\u2014 The minimum ripening period on the farm is 13 days after the day on which processing began at a temperature of at least 12\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\u2014 To obtain its fully characteristic flavour, \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d is left to ripen further in the ripening room on the farm or on the cheese merchant\u2019s premises.

After that, milk gradually began to be processed industrially. Milk used in cheese-making began to be pasteurised in the first few years of the 20th century. Pasteurisation meant that the character of dairy-made cheese was lost. On the farm, the traditional method of processing raw milk continued.\nAs a result of enzymes naturally present in milk, i.e. milk lipase, and the presence of a bacteria flora that enters the milk during and after milking, the cheese made from this raw milk has more taste, described as fuller, stronger and tangier. For many consumers, this is what distinguishes the taste of \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d from \u201cindustrially made\u201d cheese. The taste becomes stronger as ripening progresses.\nIn 1982 new rules were laid down by the Decision and Decree on Cheese Products on the basis of the Agricultural Quality Act. These rules cover cheese quality, the origin of the milk and the method of production. The related national mark guarantees that \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d is a farm product, and is made from raw milk which is kept for only a short time and comes mainly from the farm\u2019s own herd.\nThis legislation also introduces the possibility of using milk from goats, sheep and buffalo in addition to cow\u2019s milk. It also opens up the possibility of making cheese from raw milk with a lower fat content.\nThe foregoing clearly illustrates the specific character of the raw materials used and of the method of production.\n3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minimum requirements and procedures to check the specific character (Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1216/2007)\nThe requirements of this specification, as described in section 3.6 (Description of the production method of the agricultural product or foodstuff to which the name under point 3.1 applies) and the table in section 3.7 (Character of the agricultural product or foodstuff (Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1216/2007)), apply to \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d as a traditional speciality guaranteed under Regulation (EC) No 509/2006.\nEvery six to eight weeks each farm is inspected to ensure that fresh raw milk (not more than 40 hours old) is used in cheese-making and to check on use of the casein mark. Once a year administrative checks are performed to verify from which farms the milk used comes. Checks for compliance with the composition requirements cover the fat content in dry matter, moisture content and salt content in dry matter. These parameters are checked at the same time once every six to eight weeks\u00a0(1).\nIn addition, the inspection procedure is designed to check for compliance with the other characteristic properties of the various types of \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d given in the table in section 3.7. These checks on characteristic properties are carried out visually, also at the same time once every six to eight weeks.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Where \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d cheese production is seasonal, the checks are carried out once every six to eight weeks during the production period. Where annual \u201cBoerenkaas\u201d production in an undertaking is below 25\u00a0000 kilograms, the checks are carried out twice a year.\u2019."}
