(a) If the exporter uses  closed-circuit automatic loading and calibrated automatic weighing facilities for the loading of  bulk goods, the verification that the export declaration and the goods tally is to be carried out  in such a way that the quantity is determined by the calibrated automatic weighing and the nature  and characteristics are checked at random.\nThe customs office of export has also to check at random:\n-  that the weighing and loading system does not permit re-routing of the goods in these closed  circuits or other manipulations,\n-  that the time limits specified for the calibration of weighing equipment have not expired and  that the seals are intact where closed-circuit weighing systems are used,\n-  that the consignments weighed are actually loaded on the means of transport specified,\n-  that the data entered in the weighing records or weighing certificates correspond to the data  contained in the loading documents.\n(b) In exceptional cases where the quantity of bulk goods is not recorded by a calibrated automatic  weighing system, the customs office has to use any other means of checking which is satisfactory  from the commercial point of view.\n2.  (a) If the exporter has declared goods using automatic bagging, canning, bottling etc. systems  and calibrated automatic weighing/measuring equipment or packaging or bottling in compliance with  the provisions of Council Directive 75/106/EEC  (1) and Council Directive 75/107/EEC  (2), the  number of bags, cans, bottles, etc. must in principle be counted in total and the nature and  characteristics of the goods must be checked on the basis of a representative selection by the  customs office of export. The weight or volume is determined by calibrated automatic  weighing/measuring or by the packaging or the bottles within the meaning of the two Directives. The  customs office of export can weigh or measure a bag, a can or a bottle.\nIf the equipment has a calibrated automatic counter, the records of the automatic counter may be  taken into account for the physical check with respect to quantity.\nThe second subparagraph of point 1 (a) applies mutatis mutandis.\nIf the exporter uses pallets which are loaded with boxes, cans, etc., the customs office of export  selects representative pallets and checks whether the number of boxes, cans, etc. declared are  really present. It selects from these pallets a number of representative boxes/cans and checks  whether the number of bottles, units, etc. is present.\n(b)  If the exporter does not use the facilities referred to in the first and second subparagraphs,  the customs office of export must count the number of bags and cans, etc. The nature,  characteristics, weight or volume are checked on the basis of a representative selection. The  preceding subparagraph applies mutatis mutandis.\n3.  (a) As regards non-Annex II goods:\n-  which are either packaged for retail sale or appropriately marked with details concerning  content and weight on the immediate packaging, and -  which either meet the requirements of the third subparagraph of Article 3 (2) of Commission  Regulation (EC) No 1222/94  (3), or for which the quantities of product used are those set out in  Annex C to that Regulation,\nthe customs office of export may proceed as follows:\n(aa) To begin with, it checks the weight and content of the non-Annex II good put up in immediate  packaging against the details on the immediate packaging. It may weigh a piece without packaging.\n(bb) Then it counts and/or weighs - in principle - the total quantity of non-Annex II goods in  immediate packaging.\nPoints 2 (a) and (b) apply mutatis mutandis.\nIt may take a sample to verify that no substitution has taken place. Article 5 (4) of this  Regulation does not apply.\n(cc)  (aaa) The composition of such a non-Annex II good may be assumed by the customs office of  export to be correct if the description and the content indicated on the immediate packaging are  consistent with the export declaration and the registration identification code of the  manufacturing formula, which has already been checked within a year preceeding the export by the  competent authorities.\nIn this case the customs office of export must have the auditor of the competent authorities verify  a posteriori as quickly as possible if the produced goods and the exported goods are identical.  Having verified this, he must inform the customs office of export of the result.\nIf the manufacturing formula has not yet been checked by the competent authorities, the customs  office of export must have the auditor of the competent authorities verify it and the identity as  quickly as possible a posteriori.\n(bbb) For the application of this method for verifying composition, Member States must introduce in  advance a procedure whereby:\n-  the composition of the non-Annex II goods can be checked by virtue of the accounts and the  specific documents relating to production,\n-  the non-Annex II goods manufactured, the export declaration, the manufacturing formula and the  goods to be exported can be identified by means of the production documentation of the  undertaking,\n-  the identity of the goods exported, the export declaration in question, the manufacturing  formula and the goods manufactured can be verified by the auditor of the competent authority a  posteriori.\n(b) The specific documents relating to the manufacture of a non-Annex II good must be kept by the  undertakings concerned for three years from the year of export.\n(c) In cases where point 3 (a) is not applied, the customs office of export has to take  representative samples without prejudice to Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1222/94."}
