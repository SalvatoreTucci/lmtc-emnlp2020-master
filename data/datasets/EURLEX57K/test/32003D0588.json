Paragraph 5 of the said Protocol 8 provides that any subsequent privatisation of any of the benefiting companies is to take place under the same conditions. Paragraph 6 of the said Protocol 8 provides that the restructuring aid granted to the benefiting companies is to be determined by the justifications set out in the approved Polish steel restructuring plan and individual plans as approved by the Council and is not to exceed PLN 3387070000. Paragraph 7 of the said Protocol sets out the minimum net capacity reductions to be achieved. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said Protocol provide for the implementation of business plans by the benefiting companies.\n(10) In April 2003, Poland submitted to the Commission a restructuring programme and business plans which have been assessed and agreed by the Office for Competition and Consumer Protection. Under Article 3 of EU-Poland Association Council Decision No 3/2002, the extension of the abovementioned period is made conditional on a final assessment of the restructuring programme and business plans by the Commission.\n(11) The Commission has made a final assessment of the restructuring programme and business plans submitted by Poland.\n(12) The assessment indicates that restructuring aid is necessary to return certain companies in the Polish steel industry to viability.\n(13) The assessment confirms that implementation of the restructuring programme and business plans will lead to the viability of the companies under normal market conditions by the end of the restructuring period, that the amount and intensity of aid should be strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to reach this objective, that restructuring aid to the Polish steel industry should cease by the end of 2003, that the restructuring programme should be linked to a global rationalisation and reduction of overall production capacity in Poland and that the programme respects all the commitments agreed to in the Accession negotiations.\n(14) The assessment therefore concludes that the restructuring programme and business plans submitted by Poland meet the requirements of Article 8(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement and, at this stage, the conditions laid down in Protocol 8 to the Treaty of Accession.\n(15) The conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of EU-Poland Association Council Decision No 3/2002 are accordingly met,", "main_body": ["The restructuring programme and business plans submitted to the Commission by Poland on 4 April 2003 pursuant to Article 2 of EU-Poland Association Council Decision No 3/2002, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 8(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement are in compliance with the requirements of Article 8(4) of the said Protocol 2."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 July 2003.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
