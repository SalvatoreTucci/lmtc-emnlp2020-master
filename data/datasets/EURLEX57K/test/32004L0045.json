Consequently, the relevant criterion of the existing purity criteria for E 407 Carrageenan and E 407a (Processed Eucheuma Seaweed) set out in Directive 96/77/EC needs to be adapted.\n(3) It is necessary to adopt specifications for the new additives authorised through Directive 2003/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 2003 amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners: E 907 Hydrogenated poly-1-decene, E 1517 Glyceryl diacetate and E 1519 Benzyl alcohol.\n(4) It is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).\n(5) Directive 96/77/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 96/77/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 April 2005 at the latest.
