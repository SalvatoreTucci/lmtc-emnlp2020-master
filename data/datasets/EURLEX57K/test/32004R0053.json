The provisional Agreement applies from 1 January 2004.\n(2) The provisional Agreement will replace the relevant provisions in the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Arab Republic of Egypt signed on 18 January 1977\u00a0(2) and in the Agreement between the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community and the Arab Republic of Egypt signed in Brussels on 18 January 1977\u00a0(3).\n(3) In the provisional Agreement, for Community imports of certain agricultural products originating in Egypt tariff concessions are granted at a zero-rate of customs duty within the framework of tariff quotas.\n(4) For certain agricultural products for which the tariff concessions under the Cooperation Agreement have applied within reference quantities, the provisional Agreement provides for the exemption of customs duties within tariff quotas or for the exemption of customs duties for unlimited volumes.\n(5) To implement the tariff concessions provided for in the provisional Agreement, it is necessary to replace the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 relating to tariff quotas and reference quantities for products originating in Egypt.\n(6) In accordance with the provisional Agreement, the volumes of the tariff quotas for certain products should, from the second year of application, be increased annually by 3\u00a0% of the volume of the previous year, and the volumes for the tariff quotas for other products should be fixed specifically for the first to the third and following years of application.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) For the purpose of the calculation of the tariff quotas for the first year of application, it is appropriate to provide, in accordance with the provisional Agreement, that the volumes of the tariff quotas for which the quota period starts before the date of entry into force of the provisional Agreement, should be reduced by a proportion relative to that part of the period which has elapsed before that date.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "For the first year of application, the volumes of the Community tariff quotas with order numbers 09.1704, 09.1706, 09.1707, 09.1711, 09.1713, 09.1714, 09.1717, 09.1721 and 09.1725, for which the quota period starts before the date of entry into force of the provisional Agreement, shall be reduced by a proportion relative to that part of the period which has elapsed before that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 January 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik BOLKESTEIN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 2.
