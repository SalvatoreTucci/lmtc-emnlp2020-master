Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 168 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the granting and the payment of the refund for exports of live bovine animals are subject to compliance with legislation of the Union concerning animal welfare and, in particular, Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations\u00a0(4).\n(3) In order to guarantee that the animal welfare standards are maintained, a monitoring system should be introduced comprising compulsory checks at the exit point from the customs territory of the Community and after leaving the customs territory of the Community where there is a change of means of transport and also at the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination.\n(4) In order to facilitate proper checks on exit from the customs territory of the Community, it is necessary to designate exit points.\n(5) The assessment of the physical condition and state of health of animals requires specific expertise and experience. Checks should therefore be carried out by a veterinarian. Moreover, the extent of those checks should be clarified and a model report set out in order to make those checks accurate and harmonised.\n(6) Checks in third countries for the purposes of this Regulation should be compulsory and should be carried out by agencies of Member States or by international control and supervisory agencies (hereinafter referred to as \u2018SAs\u2019) approved and controlled by Member States in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 612/2009 of 7 July 2009 on laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(5). In order to carry out checks for the purposes of this Regulation, the SAs should in particular meet the requirements for approval and control set out in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 612/2009.\n(7) Article 168 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and this Regulation provide that compliance with legislation of the Union on animal welfare is a condition for the payment of export refunds. Therefore, it should be clearly set out that, without prejudice to cases of force majeure recognised by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, a violation of those animal welfare provisions does not trigger a reduction but the loss of the export refund, related to the number of animals for which the welfare requirements were not respected. It equally results from those provisions, as well as from the animal welfare rules set out in Articles 3 to 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and the Annexes referred to therein, that the refund is to be lost for the animals for which those welfare rules were not respected, irrespective of the concrete physical conditions of the animals.\n(8) In addition to the non-payment of the export refund, when there is evidence that Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 is not complied with for a high number of animals, appropriate penalties should be applied. Furthermore, where such non-compliance is due to a complete disregard of animal welfare requirements, the total loss of the refund should be established.\n(9) Given the discrepancies between different language versions, it is necessary to clarify that the refund for all animals indicated in the export declaration is to be refused if the number of animals for which no refund is paid amounts to more than 5\u00a0% of the number endorsed in the accepted export declaration, but at least three animals, or to 10 animals or more, but at least 2\u00a0% of the number endorsed in the accepted export declaration. Article 6(2)(b) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Member States should provide the Commission with the necessary information for the purposes of monitoring and reporting on the application of this Regulation.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThe payment of export refunds for live bovine animals falling within CN code 0102 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018animals\u2019), pursuant to Article 168 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, shall be subject to compliance, during the transport of the animals to the first place of unloading in the third country of final destination, with Articles 3 to 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and the Annexes referred to therein, and with this Regulation.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, in the case of transport by road, the \u2018first place of unloading in the third country of final destination\u2019 shall mean the place at which the first animal is finally unloaded from a road vehicle, thus excluding a place where the journey is interrupted to rest, feed or water the animals.", "Checks within the customs territory of the Community\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exit of the animals from the customs territory of the Community may take place only through the following exit points:\n(a) a border inspection post approved by a Commission decision for veterinary checks on live ungulates from third countries;\n(b) an exit point designated by the Member State.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The official veterinarian at the exit point shall verify in accordance with Council Directive 96/93/EC\u00a0(6) for those animals for which an export declaration is accepted whether:\n(a) the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 have been complied with from the place of departure, as defined in Article 2 (r) of that Regulation, until the exit point;\n(b) the transport conditions for the rest of the journey comply with Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and that the necessary arrangements have been taken to ensure its compliance until the first unloading in the third country of final destination.\nThe official veterinarian who has conducted the checks shall complete a report in accordance with the model set out in Annex I to this Regulation certifying whether the results of the checks performed in accordance with the first subparagraph are satisfactory or not satisfactory.\nThe veterinarian authority responsible for the exit point shall keep that report for at least three years.

However, the Member States, which have approved the international control and supervisory agencies, referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall verify that those agencies check that veterinarians holding a qualification not covered by that Directive possess the knowledge of the requirements imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1/2005. Those checks shall be carried out in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner through appropriate procedures.\nA report of each check carried out pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be completed in
