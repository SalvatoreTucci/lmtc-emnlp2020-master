That Decision lists the third countries and parts of third countries from which imports of meat products are to be authorised. That Decision also lays down the model public and animal health certificates and rules on treatments required for those products.\n(3) Following outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Brazil, Decision 79/542/EEC was amended by Commission Decision 2005/753/EC\u00a0(4) in order to amend Part I of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC and thereby suspended imports of bovine de-boned meat from the States of Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana and Sao Paulo.\n(4) In order to ensure clarity, coherence and transparency in the regionalisation provided for in Decision 79/542/EEC concerning fresh meat and in Decision 2005/432/EC concerning meat products it is necessary to amend certain of the regionalisation descriptions and timing restrictions for Brazil.\n(5) In addition, Serbia and Montenegro are Republics with their own customs territories which together form a State Union. They should therefore be entered separately on the lists of third countries and parts of third countries from which imports of meat products are authorised.\n(6) Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 14.6.1979, p. 15.
