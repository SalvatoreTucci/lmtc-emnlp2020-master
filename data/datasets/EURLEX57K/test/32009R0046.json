Experience gained implementing the prohibition of medals and tokens similar to euro coins has highlighted the need to clarify the protective provisions and to make the decision-making process more transparent.\n(2) The public may be led to believe that some medals and tokens have legal tender status, not only when they bear a design similar to euro coins but also when they bear certain elements of the designs on euro coins. Therefore specific elements of the designs on legal tender euro coins should not be reproduced in the way they are depicted on euro coins. In addition, symbols that are representative of the issuing Member State\u2019s sovereignty should not be reproduced on medals and tokens in the way they are depicted on euro coins.\n(3) The Commission, after having consulted the counterfeit coin experts referred to in Commission Decision 2005/37/EC of 29 October 2004 establishing the European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC) and providing for coordination of technical actions to protect euro coins against counterfeiting\u00a0(3), should specify whether the protective provisions referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 have been respected and whether a metallic object is a medal/token.\n(4) The specific criteria that are employed by the Commission in declaring conformity with the protective provisions should be clarified and laid down.\n(5) The risk of mistaking a medal or a token bearing the terms \u2018euro\u2019, \u2018euro cent\u2019 or the euro symbol for a legal tender coin is greater where a nominal value is also associated with that medal or token. Therefore, in such cases, the indication \u2018Not legal tender\u2019 should be stamped on the obverse or the reverse of the medal or token concerned.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nRegulation (EC) No 2182/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. Article 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n(a) when the terms \u201ceuro\u201d or \u201ceuro cent\u201d or the euro symbol appear on their surface;\n(b) when their size is inside the reference band; or\n(c) when a design appearing on their surface is similar to:\n(i) any design, or parts thereof, appearing on the surface of euro coins, including in particular the terms \u201ceuro\u201d or \u201ceuro cent\u201d, the 12 stars of the European Union, the image of the geographical representation and the numerals, in the way depicted on euro coins; or\n(ii) those symbols representative of national sovereignty of Member States, as depicted on euro coins, including in particular the effigies of the Head of State, the coat of arms, the Mint marks, the Mint master marks, the name of the Member State;\n(iii) the edge shape or the edge design of euro coins; or\n(iv) the euro symbol.\n(a) whether a metallic object can be regarded as a medal or token within the meaning of Article 1(c);\n(b) whether a medal or a token falls within the prohibition of paragraph 1 of this Article.\n2.
