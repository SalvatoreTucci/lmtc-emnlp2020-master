whereas such improvement is likely to help towards putting the market on a sounder footing, eliminating structural excess capacities and improving the quality of the service provided, in the interests of users, carriers and the economy as a whole;\nWhereas satisfactory results have been obtained through the implementation of Council Directive 74/561/EEC of 12 November 1974 on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator in national and international transport operations\u00a0(4) and Council Directive 77/796/EEC of 12 December 1977 aiming at the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications for goods haulage operators and road passenger transport operators, including measures intended to encourage these operators effectively to exercise their right to freedom of establishment\u00a0(5);\nWhereas the rules governing access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway should therefore cover at least the professional competence of the carrier; whereas Member States may also maintain or lay down rules governing the good repute and financial standing of the carrier;\nWhereas, however, there is no need to include in the common rules laid down by this Directive certain transport activities with a minor economic impact and whereas transport on own account is by definition excluded from these rules; whereas it also seems appropriate to provide for the possible exclusion from the scope of this Directive of carriers operating exclusively on navigable waterways within their territory not linked to the waterway network of another Member State;\nWhereas there is a need for mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications for the activities covered by this Directive, in order to promote the effective exercise of the right of establishment;\nWhereas the certificate of professional competence issued pursuant to the provisions of this Directive regarding access to the occupation of carrier must be recognized as sufficient proof by the host Member State;\nWhereas Member States which impose on their own nationals certain requirements as to good repute and financial standing must recognize the productinon of appropriate documents issued by a competent authority in the carrier's State of origin or prior establishment as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States;\nWhereas, further, this Directive must also apply to employed persons covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community\u00a0(6), if the Member States make access to the occupation covered by this Directive or the exercise thereof by such persons conditional on the possession of professional knowledge and skills,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nDefinitions and scope", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Access to the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway in national and international transport shall be governed by the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to the common rules laid down in this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Directive:\n\u2014 \u2018occupation of carrier of goods by waterway vessel\u2019 means the activities engaged in by any natural person or any undertaking carrying goods by inland waterway for hire or reward, even if this occupation is not exercised on a regular basis,\n\u2014 \u2018undertaking\u2019 means companies or firms within the meaning of Article 58 of the Treaty and groups or cooperatives of operators whose purpose is to obtain business from shipping agents for distribution among their members, irrespective of whether such groups or cooperatives possess legal personality.", "This Directive shall not apply to natural persons or undertakings pursuing the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway using vessels with a deadweight capacity at maximum draft not exceeding 200 tonnes.\nMember States may lower this limit for all or some transport operations or certain categories of transport.\nThis Directive shall likewise not apply to natural persons or undertakings operating ferries.\nCHAPTER II\nAccess to the occupation", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Natural persons or undertakings wishing to pursue the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway must satisfy the condition of professional competence, even if they are members of a group or cooperative of operators within the meaning of Article 1 (2) or exercise their occupation exclusively for a specific period of time as subcontractors to another waterway transport undertaking.\nIf the applicant is a natural person who does not satisfy that condition, the competent authorities may nevertheless authorize him to pursue the occupation of carrier of goods by waterway provided that he indicates to them another person satisfying the condition who in actual fact manages the transport operations on a permanent basis.\nIf the applicant is an undertaking within the meaning of Article 1 (2) one of the natural persons who in actual fact manage the undertaking's transport operations on a permanent basis must meet the condition of professional competence.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The condition of professional competence shall consist in the possession of the standard of competence accepted by the authority or body appointed for this purpose by each Member State in the subjects listed in the Annex.
