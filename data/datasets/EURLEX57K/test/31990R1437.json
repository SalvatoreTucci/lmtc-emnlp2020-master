whereas this aspect is fulfilled if the possibility for individual agricultural products, originating in the aforesaid third countries, to penetrate the Community market is not less, in 1990, than the average for 1987 and 1988; whereas the average imports of chemically pure fructose, originating in these countries, during 1987 and 1988, amounted to 4 504 tonnes; whereas it is therefore appropriate to open, for the period 1 July to 31 December 1990, a Community quota, exempt from the variable component, for an amount equal to 2 252 tonnes;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the product in question into all the Member States until the quota is exhausted; whereas it is appropriate not to provide for allocation among Member States, without prejudice to the drawing on the amount of the quota, of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to the procedure provided for in Article 3;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the drawings made by that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["From 1 July to 31 December 1990, the variable component applicable to imports, into the Community, of the following product, originating in third countries not bound to the Community by a preferential trade agreement, shall be suspended totally, within the limits of a Community quota as shown below:\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CN code  // Description  // Amount of quota (in tonnes)   // Quota duty (%)   //    //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //  // 09.0091   // 1702 50 00   // Chemically pure fructose L 114, 27. 4. 1989, p. 1.", "The quota referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission, which may take any appropriate measure with a view to ensuring the efficient administration thereof.", "If an importer presents in a Member State a declaration of entry into free circulation including a request for preferential benefit of the quota for a product covered by this Regulation, and if this declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member State concerned shall draw, from the quota, by means of notification to the Commission, a quantity corresponding to these needs.\nThe requests for drawing, with the indication of the date of acceptance of the said declaration, must be communicated to the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings shall be granted by the Commission on the basis of the date of acceptance of the declarations of entry into free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member State concerned, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the tariff quota.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the tariff quota, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests, Member States shall be informed by the Commission of the drawings made.", "Each Member State shall ensure that importers of the product concerned have equal and continuous access to the quota for such times as the residual balance of the quota so permits.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1990.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 May 1990.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
