G.  Durand et Cie)  (Only the French text is authentic)  (91/80/EEC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,\nWhereas:\nA. PROCEDURE\n(1) In Regulation (EEC) No 550/83 (2), amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3337/84 (3), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of dense sodium carbonate originating in the United States of America.\n(2) In 1988 certain American producers and/or exporters together with the Standing Committee of Glass Industries of the European Economic Community applied to the Commission for a review of the abovementioned measures. Following the review, the  Commission, by Decision 90/507/EEC (4), terminated the review without imposing further anti-dumping measures.\n(3) In June 1988 Verrerie Cristallerie d'Arques, J. G. Durand et Cie, an importer of dense sodium carbonate originating in the United States of America, acting through the French authorities, submitted an application for the reimbursement of the  anti-dumping duties paid at the beginning of May 1988 on imports of dense sodium carbonate exported by the American Company, Kerr McGee Corporation, to the value of FF [ . . . ] (5).\n(4) With the agreement of the applicant, and in accordance with point 5 of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (6), the procedure was suspended.\nAs Kerr McGee had not exported any dense sodium carbonate during the investigation period covered by the original anti-dumping procedure, the method of calculating the dumping margin of this exporter, applied at the time of the review, could be used to  establish its actual dumping margin.\n(5) Following publication of the outcome of the review procedure, during which the exporter had the opportunity to put forward observations, the applicant firm was informed of the Commission's conclusions regarding the request for reimbursement and was  given the opportunity to put forward its point of view.\n(6) In accordance with Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission informed the other Member States and gave its opinion on the admissibility and merits of the applications. There were no objections from any Member States.\nB. ADMISSIBILITY\n(7) The application is admissible as it was made in accordance with Community anti-dumping law, in particular the provisions on deadlines.\nC. EXAMINATION OF THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATION\n(8) The application is found to be partially justified. It was established during the review procedure that there was an actual dumping margin of 11,9 % which was significantly below the duty paid. Consequently, in accordance with the provisions of  Article 16\nof Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the applicant has a right to be reimbursed that part of the anti-dumping duty which it paid in excess of the actual dumping margin.\nD. AMOUNT TO BE REPAID\n(9) Consequently, the anti-dumping duty due on the basis of the actual dumping margin has been deducted from the amount of duty paid. The applicant is therefore entitled to a reimbursement of FF [ . . . ].", "main_body": ["    Article 1\nThe application for the reimbursement of an anti-dumping duty submitted in June 1988 by Verrerie Cristallerie d'Arques, J.
