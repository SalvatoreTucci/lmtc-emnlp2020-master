During sensitive market periods movement within Portugal and release for consumption in that country of the products referred to in Article 1 shall be subject to presentation of an STM licence.\nThe provisions of the first subparagraph, as far as movement within Portugal is concerned, shall not apply if the holder of the products can prove that they are not intended for the Portuguese market.';\n2. in Article 7,\n- the present text becomes paragraph 1,\n- a paragraph 2 shall be added, as follows:\n'2. If all or part of the Portuguese market is affected by serious disturbances which persist in spite of the application of the measures provided for in paragraph 1, appropriate measures, differing from those provided for there and in addition to them,  may be adopted according to the procedure provided for in Article 252 of the Act of Accession. These measures may include derogations for local or regional markets from the provisions on common organization of markets.';\n3. the following Articles shall be inserted:\n'Article 7a\n1. Sales invoices and other commercial documents, apart from retail sale documents, to be determined relating to products coming from other Member States and imported into Portugal during those periods when presentation of an STM licence is required in  application of Article 6, shall indicate the number of the licence used for purposes of release for consumption in Portugal together with any other necessary information.\n2. The Portuguese authorities shall, using the commercial documents indicated in paragraph 1 and the information shown on packages, make checks, in wholesale markets in particular, on whether products coming from other Member States have been released  for consumption on presentation of an STM licence during the periods when presentation of such a licence is required in application of Article 6.\n3. None of the checks indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 may take place at the borders between Member States.", "b\nIn case of failure to observe the provisions laid down by this Regulation or rules adopted pursuant thereto, the Portuguese authorities and those of other Member States shall apply penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. In the case  of operators who have placed on the market into Portugal, without an STM licence, products subject to the STM during periods when presentation of a licence is required pursuant to Article 6, the penalties referred to may not be less than twice the value  of the products placed on the market without an STM licence.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 March 1993.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
