The consolidation of these concessions will take place together with an increase of preferences in sausages and certain meat products. This includes the opening of new Community tariff quotas for the import of different products falling under CN codes ex\u00a00210\u00a019\u00a050, ex\u00a00210\u00a019\u00a081, ex\u00a01601\u00a000 and ex\u00a01602\u00a049\u00a019, originating in Switzerland.\n(2) The bilateral procedures for adapting the concessions in Annexes 1 and 2 to the Agreement will take time. In order to ensure that quota benefit is available until the said adaptation enters into force, it is appropriate to open those tariff quotas on an autonomous and transitional basis and to do so from 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2009. This will ensure ample time for finalising both bilateral procedures and subsequent implementation measures by Parties.\n(3) Detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation and, in particular, the provisions required for quota management should be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common market organisation in pigmeat\u00a0(3).\n(4) To be eligible for the benefit of these tariff quotas, products should originate in Switzerland in accordance with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Community tariff quota for products and volume listed in the Annex and originating in Switzerland shall be opened annually, on an autonomous and transitional basis, for the period from 1 January to 31 December, under the order number 09.4180.
