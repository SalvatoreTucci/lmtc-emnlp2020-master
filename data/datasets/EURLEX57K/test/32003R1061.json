For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.\n(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.\n(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.\n(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.\n(7) Tomatoes, oranges, table grapes and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.\n(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports, it is appropriate to fix the A1 and B export refunds.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1.
