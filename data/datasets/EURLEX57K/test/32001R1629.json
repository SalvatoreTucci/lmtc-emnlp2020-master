That coefficient expresses the ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirituous beverage concerned on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirituous beverage in question. In view of the information provided by the United Kingdom on the period 1 January to 31 December 2000, the average ageing period in 2000 was seven years for Scotch whisky. The coefficients for the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 should be fixed.\n(2) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area(3) precludes the grant of refunds for exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Therefore, pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93, account should be taken of this in the calculation of the coefficient for 2001/02.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["For the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 the coefficients provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 applying to cereals used in the United Kingdom for manufacturing Scotch whisky shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 258, 16.10.1993, p. 6.\n(2) OJ L 187, 26.7.2000, p. 29.\n(3) OJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 1.\nANNEX\nCoefficients applicable in the United Kingdom\n>TABLE>"}
