Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) The preparation of narasin, CAS number 55134-13-9, and nicarbazin, CAS number 330-95-0, was authorised for ten years in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3). That additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of that additive, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 7\u00a0April 2010 that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of narasin and of nicarbazin do not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment and that these additives are effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens for fattening\u00a0(4). It considers that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring to control the possible development of bacterial and/or Eimeria spp resistances. Since p-nitroaniline, an impurity associated with nicarbazin, leads to possible residues of this substance, the Authority recommends that the content of that impurity be limited at the lowest achievable level. The Authority also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of narasin and nicarbazin shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation. In view of the opinion of the Authority, it is, however, necessary to limit the content of the impurity p-nitroaniline. To give producers and users time to adapt, it is appropriate for this limitation to start to apply three years after this Regulation becomes applicable.\n(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the provisions on that preparation in Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 should be deleted.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999, the entry under the registration number of additive E 772, concerning Narasin 80\u00a0g/kg \u2014 Nicarbazin 80\u00a0g/kg (Maxiban G160), is deleted.\nPremixture and compound feed containing the feed additive labelled in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 may continue to be placed on the market and remain on the market and used until stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 October 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(4):1574.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition\nNarasin: 80\u00a0g activity/kg\nNicarbazin: 80\u00a0g/kg\nVegetal or mineral oil: 10-30\u00a0g/kg\nVermiculite: 0-20\u00a0g/kg\nMicro tracer red: 11\u00a0g/kg\nCorn cob grits or rice hulls qs 1\u00a0kg\nActive substance\n1.
