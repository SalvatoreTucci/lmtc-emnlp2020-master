Those tariff quotas should be opened.\n(3) In order to avoid any discrimination between Mexico and other exporting countries having access to Community tariff quotas for bananas pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 of 7 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community\u00a0(4), the tariff quotas for bananas pursuant to this Regulation should be considered initially as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5) when they are managed under the system laid down in Article 308a of that Regulation and Article 308c(2) and (3) of that Regulation should not apply.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 17 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas\u00a0(6) the import of bananas into the Community is subject to the submission of an import licence. This requirement is unnecessary as regards the fresh bananas covered by this Regulation, since the \u2018first come, first served\u2019 management system as laid down in Article 308a of Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 provides equivalent information to that obtained on an import licence.\n(5) Management of the tariff quotas for egg products (under order numbers 09.1832 and 09.1869) requires a coefficient to be applied to the net weight of the goods declared to customs. With a view to improving the efficiency of managing the tariff quotas in question, a separate order number should be created for each group of products having a single coefficient.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since Decision No 3/2004 of the EU-Mexico Joint Council of 29 July 2004 enters into force on 1 May 2004 this Regulation should be applicable from the same date.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
