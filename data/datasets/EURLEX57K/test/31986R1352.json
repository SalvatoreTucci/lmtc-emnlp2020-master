whereas, in accordance  with Article 1 (3) of the above Regulation, the marketing years for the products in question are as  follows:-  for cauliflowers, from 1 May to 30 April,-  for tomatoes, from 1 January to 31  December,-  for peaches, from 1 May to 31 October,-  for lemons, from 1 June to 31 May,-  for  pears, from 1 June to 31 May,  -  for table grapes, from 1 May to 30 April,-  for apples, from 1  July to 30 June,-  for mandarins, from 1 October to 15 May,-  for oranges, from 1 October to 15  July,-  for aubergines, from 1 January to 31 December,-  for apricots, from 1 May to 31 August;  Whereas, however, pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No  1035/72, no basic price or buying-in price must be fixed for the slack marketing periods at the  beginning and at the end of the marketing year; Whereas, when the basic prices and buying-in prices  for fruit and vegetables are fixed, account should be taken of the aims of the common agricultural  policy and the contribution which the Community desires to make to the harmonious development of  world trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are, in particular, to ensure  a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure the availability of supplies  and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices; Whereas the basic prices must be  fixed by reference to the trend in the average prices recorded during the three preceding years on  the most representative producer markets within the Community for a product with defined commercial  characteristics, such as a variety or type, quality class, size and packaging; whereas the  buying-in prices must be fixed by reference to the basic price in accordance with Article 16 (3) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; Whereas in order to facilitate the application of Article 19 of  Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 in certain Member States in which the most representative varieties of  oranges are different from those taken as the reference for calculating the basic prices and  buying-in prices, these representative varieties should also be taken into consideration for the  purpose of applying the said Article 19; Whereas, as regards Greece, in accordance with Article 74  of the Act of Accession, moves towards alignment of basic prices and buying-in prices applicable in  that Member State should be made in accordance with Article 59 (2) (a), (3) (a) and (b) of that  Act;

whereas the prices and amounts fixed by this Regulation are therefore applicable only  in the Community of Ten; Whereas the amount of the financial compensation for oranges, mandarins  and lemons must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 7 (2) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2511/69,", "main_body": ["For the 1986/87  marketing year, the basic prices and the buying-in prices for fruit and vegetables, the periods  during which they apply and the standard qualities to which they relate shall be as set out in  Annex I.", "For the 1986/87 marketing year, the financial compensation for oranges,  mandarins and lemons shall be as set out in Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into  force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member  States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 1986.
