However, providing both R-phrases sends a conflicting message. Preparations should therefore only be classified and labelled with the higher category.\n(2) For substances very toxic to the aquatic environment (classified as N) and assigned the R-phrases R50 or R50/53, specific concentration limits (SCLs) are currently applied to substances listed in Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC in order to avoid an underestimation of the hazard. This measure creates distortions between preparations containing substances listed in Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC, to which SCLs are applied, and those preparations containing substances not yet included in Annex I, but classified and labelled provisionally in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 67/548/EEC and to which no SCLs are applicable. It is therefore necessary to ensure that SCLs are applied in the same way to all preparations containing substances very toxic to the aquatic environment.\n(3) On 6 August 2001, the Commission adopted Directive 2001/59/EC\u00a0(3) adapting to technical progress Directive 67/548/EEC. Directive 2001/59/EC revised the criteria in Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC for the classification and labelling of ozone depleting substances. The revised Annex III now only provides for the assignment of the symbol N in addition to R-phrase R59.\n(4) The terminology used to describe the packaging and the labelling requirements in Annex V to Directive 1999/45/EC has raised concerns due to the lack of consistency. It is therefore appropriate to modify the wording in Annex V to Directive 1999/45/EC to make it more accurate.\n(5) Annexes II, III and V to Directive 1999/45/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations established under Article 20 of Directive 1999/45/EC,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III and V to Directive 1999/45/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 March 2007 at the latest.
