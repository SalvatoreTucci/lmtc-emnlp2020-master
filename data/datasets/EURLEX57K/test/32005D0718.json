The Commission will publish the references of such standards.\n(4) Article 4(2) of the Directive lays down a procedure for publication of references of standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies before the entry into force of the Directive. If those standards ensure compliance with the general safety requirement, the Commission shall decide to publish their references in the Official Journal of the European Union. In these cases, the Commission shall, on its initiative or at the request of a Member State, decide in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15(2) of that Directive whether the standard in question meets the general safety requirement. The Commission shall decide to publish its references after consulting the Committee established by Article 5 of the Directive 98/34/EC. The Commission shall notify the Member States of its decision.\n(5) Some standards have however been adopted by the European standardisation bodies since the entry into force of the Directive without a mandate under Article 4(1) of the Directive. The intention of the legislator was to ensure cooperation with the European standardisation bodies and to recognise suitable safety standards applicable to products falling under the scope of the Directive for which a Commission mandate was not issued in accordance with the relevant provisions referred to in Article 4. It is therefore appropriate to consider the publication of the references of such standards and to that aim to proceed according to the procedure provided for in Article 4(2).\n(6) This decision on compliance of the standards listed in the Annex with the general safety requirement is taken at the initiative of the Commission.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["The standards listed in the Annex meet the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC for the risks that they cover.", "The references of the standards in the Annex shall be published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.
