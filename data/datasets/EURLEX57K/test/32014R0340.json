Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No\u00a01308/2013 as from 1 January 2014.\n(2) Chapter I of Title I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 introduces a number of changes to the system of public intervention applicable from 1 January 2014.\n(3) In the cereals and rice sectors, the concept of intervention centres has been abolished and sorghum is deleted from the list of products eligible for public intervention.\n(4) In the milk and milk products sector, the buying-in of butter and skimmed milk powder will take place by means of a tendering system that is opened by the Commission once the fixed price quantities are reached.\n(5) In the beef sector, the determination of the maximum buying-in price will be based on the average market price in a Member State or region of a Member State. In addition, the former category A of male carcasses has been split into new category A and new category Z for carcasses of bovine animals and introduced in the classification set out in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013; male animals in this category Z will be eligible for public intervention.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to implement those changes by amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 accordingly.\n(7) Since the concept of intervention centres is abolished, Commission Regulations (EU) No 1125/2010\u00a0(4) and (EU) No 162/2011\u00a0(5) have become obsolete. For the sake of legal certainty, those Regulations should be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) the title of Chapter I of Title I is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) the title is replaced by the following:\n(b) point (a) of paragraph 1 is deleted;\n(c) the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(4) in Article 8(1), point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) for common wheat, barley and maize: 80 tonnes;\u2019;\n(5) Article 10 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1(a), point (iv) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(iv) for cereals and rice, the approved storage place for which the offer or tender is made, at the lowest cost taking into account Article 29; this storage place shall not be the storage place where the product is held at the time of the offer or tender;\u2019;\n(b) in paragraph 2, the reference to \u2018Article 2(3)\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Article 2(2)\u2019;\n(6) Article 16 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 2 is amended as follows:\n(i) point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) the tendering procedure for buying-in of common wheat, butter or skimmed milk powder for amounts in excess of the maximum quantity offered, respectively, of 3 million tonnes, 50\u00a0000 tonnes or 109\u00a0000 tonnes;\u2019;\n(ii) point (b) is deleted;\n(b) a new paragraph 2a is inserted:\n(c) paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n(7) in Article 21, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(8) in Article 26, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(9) in Article 31(2), the reference to \u2018Article (2)(3)\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Article 2(2)\u2019;\n(10) in Article 32(5), point (i) is deleted;\n(11) in Article 47(3), the terms \u2018\u2026 in accordance with Parts IX, X and XI of Annex I\u2019 are replaced by: \u2018\u2026 in accordance with Parts IX and XI of Annex I\u2019;\n(12) Article 55 is amended as follows:\n(a) the title is replaced by the following:\n(b) paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n(i) point (b) is deleted;\n(ii) point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) the approved storage places; and\u2019;\n(c) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n(13) Annex I is amended in accordance with Part A of the Annex to this Regulation;\n(14) Annex III is amended in accordance with Part B of the Annex to this Regulation;\n(15) the list of Annexes is amended in accordance with Part C of the Annex to this Regulation.", "Regulations (EU) No 1125/2010 and (EU) No 162/2011 are repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 of 11 December 2009 laying down common detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards buying-in and selling of agricultural products under public intervention (OJ L\u00a0349, 29.12.2009, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1125/2010 of 3 December 2010 determining the intervention centres for cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1173/2009 (OJ L\u00a0318, 4.12.2010, p.\u00a010).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 162/2011 of 21 February 2011 determining the intervention centres for rice (OJ L\u00a047, 22.2.2011, p.\u00a011).\nANNEX\nA.
