DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to plums of varieties (cultivars) grown from:\n- Prunus domestica L. ssp. domestica,\n- Prunus domestica L. ssp. insititia (L.) Schneid.,\n- Prunus domestica L. ssp. italica (Borkh.) Gams,\n- Prunus domestica L. ssp. syriaca (Borkh.) Janchen, and\n- Prunus salicina Lindl.\nto be supplied fresh to the consumer, plums for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements for plums after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the plums must be:\n- intact,\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n- practically free from pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- free of abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe plums must have been carefully picked. They must be sufficiently developed and display satisfactory ripeness.\nThe development and condition of the plums must be such as to enable them to:\n- withstand transport and handling, and\n- arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nPlums are classified into the three classes defined below:\n(i) \"Extra\" class\nPlums in this class must be of superior quality. In shape, development and colouring they must be characteristic of the variety. They must be:\n- practically covered by their bloom, according to variety,\n- of firm flesh.\nThey must be free from defects, with the exception of very slight superficial defects, provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package.\n(ii) Class I\nPlums in this class must be of good quality. They must be characteristic of the variety.\nThe following slight defects, however, may be allowed, provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package:\n- a slight defect in shape,\n- a slight defect in development,\n- slight defects in colouring,\n- skin defects of elongated shape must not exceed in length one third of the maximum diameter of the fruit. In particular, healed cracks may be allowed for \"Golden gage\" varieties(1),\n- other skin defects of which the total area affected must not exceed one sixteenth of the whole surface.\n(iii) Class II\nThis class includes plums which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes, but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe following defects may be allowed, provided the plums retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:\n- defects in shape,\n- defects in development,\n- defects in colouring,\n- skin defects of which the total area affected must not exceed one quarter of the whole surface.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\nSize is determined by the maximum diameter of the equatorial section.\nMinimum sizes are fixed as follows:\n>TABLE>\nFor the \"Extra\" class, the maximum difference in diameter between fruit in any one package is fixed at 10 mm.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements for the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) \"Extra\" class:\n5 % by number or weight of plums not satisfying the requirements of the class but meeting those of Class I or, excetionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n(ii) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of plums not satisfying the requirements of the class but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class. Within this tolerance, not more than 2 % in total may consist of split and/or worm-eaten fruit.\n(iii) Class II\n10 % by number or weight of plums satisfying neither the requirements of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting, market bruising or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption. Within this tolerance, not more than 4 % in total may consist of split and/or worm-eaten fruit.\nB. Size tolerances\nFor all classes, 10 % by number or weight of plums deviating from the minimum size or the size stated on the package, the deviation not exceeding 3 mm above or below.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and contain only plums of the same origin, variety, quality and size (i) sized), and for the \"Extra\" class, the contents must also be uniform in colour.\nThe visible part of the contents of each package must be representative of the entire contents.\nB. Packaging\nPlums must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, particularly of paper or stamps bearing trade specifications is allowed provided that the printing or labelling has been done with non-toxic ink or glue.\nPackages must be free from all foreign matter.\nC. Presentation\nThe plums may be presented:\n- in small packages,\n- arranged in one or more layers separated from each other,\n- in bulk in the package, except for the \"Extra\" class.\nVI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package must bear the following particulars in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked and visible from the outside:\nA. Identification\nPacker and/or dispatcher: name and address or officially issued or accepted code mark. However, in the case where a code mark is used, the reference \"packer and/or dispatcher (or equivalent abbreviations)\" has to be indicated in close connection with the code mark.\nB. Nature of produce\n- \"Plums\", if the contents are not visible from the outside\n- name of the variety.\nC. Origin of produce\nCountry of origin and, optionally, district where grown or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- class,\n- size (if sized) expressed in minimum and maximum diameter.\nE.
