It would be appropriate, provided that it is established that no new outbreaks occur, as of 18 June 2003 to limit the geographical scope for the trade and movements restrictions currently in force to the provinces previously affected by the disease and thus to allow trade in live poultry and poultry products from the other provinces of the Dutch territory, which should then be considered as free of avian influenza.\n(6) Furthermore, if no new outbreaks occur, and in light of a positive disease evolution, restriction measures should be relaxed as of the 18 of June 2003 to allow the movement of certain categories of live poultry and hatching eggs, from areas within the affected provinces that fall outside established surveillance and buffer zones to non-restricted provinces in the Netherlands. However such movements should only occur under the condition that poultry and hatching eggs originating from such provinces should not be traded within the Community, but should be confined to Dutch territory.\n(7) In the light of the positive disease evolution while bearing in mind the need for continued precaution, the measures laid down in Decision 2003/290/EC should be further prolonged until 11 July 2003 in the provinces where disease has occurred.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/290/EC shall be amended as follows:\n1. a new Article 7a is added as follows:\n\"Article 7a\n1.
