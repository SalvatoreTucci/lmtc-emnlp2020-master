However, this authorisation will expire on 31 December 2003 at the latest if the Directive has not entered into force by that date, enabling an assessment to be made at that time of the necessity for a derogation in the light of the discussions held within the Council.\n(9) The derogation has no adverse impact on the European Communities' own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Decision 98/198/EC shall be replaced by the following: \"Article 3\nThis authorisation shall expire on the date of the entry into force of the Community rules determining what expenditure is not to be eligible for the deduction of value added tax, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 17(6) of the sixth VAT Directive, but on 31 December 2003 at the latest.\"", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
