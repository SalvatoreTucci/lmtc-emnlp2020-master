Ireland may authorize the supply and use of aldrin, under the supervision of officials of the Department of Agriculture, for the treatment of blackcurrant and gooseberry plantations in the counties of Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford during the 1987 and 1988 growing seasons in order to control infestations of vine weevil, subject to the obligations set out in Article 2.\n2. Ireland shall send to the Commission and the other Member States by 31 March 1988 and 31 March 1989 a report on the extent to which aldrin was used pursuant to this Decision during the previous year.", "1. Trials shall be conducted during the 1987 and 1988 growing seasons, under the supervision of officials of the Department of Agriculture and in accordance with generally recognized procedures, to ascertain whether products not containing active substances prohibited by Directive 79/117/EEC can be effective against vine weevil in soft-fruit plantations.
