ionizing radiation during their activities in controlled areas\n(90/641/Euratom)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community; and in particular Articles 31 and 32 thereof,\nHaying regard to the proposal from the Commission, submitted following consultation with a group of persons appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee from among scientific experts in the Member States, as laid down in Article 31 of the Treaty,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\u00a0(1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee\u00a0(2),\nWhereas, Article 2 (b) of the Treaty provides that the Community shall establish uniform safety standards to protect the health of workers and of the general public and ensure that they are applied in accordance with the procedures laid down in Chapter III of Title II of the Treaty;\nWhereas, on 2 February 1959, the Council adopted Directives laying down the basic standards for the protection of the health of workers and of the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiations\u00a0(3), as amended by Directives 80/836/Euratom\u00a0(4) and 84/467/Euratom\u00a0(5);\nWhereas Title VI of Directive 80/836/Euratom lays down the fundamental principles governing operational protection of exposed workers;\nWhereas Article 40 (1) of that Directive provides that each Member State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the effective protection of exposed workers;\nWhereas Article 20 and 23 of that Directive establish a classification of areas of work and categories of exposed workers according to the level of exposure;\nWhereas the workers performing activities in a controlled area within the meaning of the said Articles 20 and 23 can belong to the personnel of the operator or be outside workers;\nWhereas Article 3 of Directive 80/836/Euratom concerning the activities referred to in Article 2 of that Directive provides that they should be reported or subject to prior authorization in cases decided upon by each Member State;\nWhereas outside workers are liable to be exposed to ionizing radiation in several controlled areas in succession in one and the same Member State or in different Member States; whereas these specific working conditions require an appropriate radiological monitoring system;\nWhereas any radiological monitoring system for outside workers must provide protection equivalent to that offered the operator's established workers, by means of common provisions;\nWhereas, pending the introduction of a uniform Community-wide system, account should also be taken of the radiological monitoring systems for outside workers which may exist in the Member States;\nWhereas, to optimize the protection of outside workers, it is necessary to define clearly the obligations of outside undertakings and operators, without prejudice to the contribution that outside workers themselves have to make to their own protection;\nWhereas the system for the radiological protection of outside workers also applies as far as practicable to the case of a self-employed worker with the status of outside undertaking,", "main_body": ["TITLE I\nPurpose and definitions", "The purpose of this Directive is to supplement Directive 80/836/Euratom thereby optimizing at Community level operational protection arrangements for outside workers performing activities in controlled areas.", "For the purposes of this Directive:\n\u2014 \u2018controlled

any sort in a controlled area;\n\u2014 \u2018outside worker\u2019 means any worker of category A, as defined in Article 23 of Directive 80/836/Euratom, performing activities of any sort in a controlled area, whether employed temporarily or permanently by an outside undertaking, including trainees, apprentices and students within the meaning of Article 10 of that Directive, or whether he provides services as a self-employed worker;\n\u2014 \u2018radiological monitoring system\u2019 means measures to apply the arrangements set out in Directive 80/836/Euratom, and in particular in Title VI thereof, during the activities of outside workers.\n\u2014 \u2018activities carried out by a worker\u2019 means any service or services provided by an outside worker in a controlled area for which an operator is responsible.\nTITLE II\nObligations of Member States' competent authorities", "Each Member State shall make the performance of the activities referred to in Article 2 of Directive

"1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall ensure that the radiological monitoring system affords outside workers equivalent protection to that for workers employed on a permanent basis by the operator.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pending the establishment, at Community level, of a uniform system for the radiological protection of outside workers, such as a computer network, recourse shall be had:\n(a) on a transitional basis, in accordance with the common provisions set out in Annex I, to\n\u2014 a centralized national network, or\n\u2014 the issuing of an individual radiological monitoring document to every outside worker, in which case the common provisions of Annex II shall also apply;\n(b) in the case of cross-frontier outside workers, and until the date of establishment
