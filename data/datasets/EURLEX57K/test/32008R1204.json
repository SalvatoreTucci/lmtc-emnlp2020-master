In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(4), the Member States have forwarded to the Commission applications for the registration of certain names as certificates of special character.\n(3) The names concerned could be entered in the \u2018Register of certificates of specific character\u2019 and therefore protected throughout the Community as traditional specialities guaranteed. Following the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006, the said register was replaced by the \u2018Register of traditional specialities guaranteed\u2019 laid down in Article 3 of the said Regulation.\n(4) The names so registered are entitled to use the endorsement \u2018traditional speciality guaranteed\u2019 which is reserved for them.\n(5) The term \u2018Serrano\u2019 is considered specific in itself in accordance with Article 4(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006, i.e. it is untranslatable. It must therefore be used as it stands. Furthermore, the term \u2018Serrano\u2019 is registered without prejudice to the use of the term \u2018mountain\u2019. There is no conflict between the two terms.\n(6) As regards the names \u2018Leche certificada de Granja\u2019 and \u2018Traditional Farmfresh Turkey\u2019, protection has been requested solely for the Spanish version of the name \u2018Leche certificada de Granja\u2019 and for the English version of the name \u2018Traditional Farmfresh Turkey\u2019. Therefore, in accordance with Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs\u00a0(5), when these two products are marketed their labels must include in the other languages, immediately next to the name concerned, the words \u2018traditional Spanish-style\u2019 or their equivalent for the former product and the equivalent of \u2018traditional British-style\u2019 for the latter.\n(7) As regards the name \u2018Traditional Farmfresh Turkey\u2019, in accordance with Directive 2000/13/EC, the labelling and in particular the information intended for consumers must in no case lead to confusion with the terms laid down for indicating types of farming in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1538/91 of 5 June 1991 introducing detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultrymeat\u00a0(6),", "main_body": ["The names set out in Annex I hereto are hereby entered in the \u2018Register of traditional specialities guaranteed\u2019, as provided for in Article 9(4) and the second subparagraph of Article 9(5) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006.", "When marketing \u2018Leche certificada de Granja\u2019 in languages other than Spanish, the label must include the expression \u2018traditional Spanish-style\u2019, or its equivalent in the other languages.\nWhen marketing \u2018Traditional Farmfresh Turkey\u2019 in languages other than English, the label must include an expression equivalent to: \u2018traditional British-style\u2019.", "Regulation (EC) No 2301/97 is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 319, 21.11.1997, p. 8.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0See Annex II.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 208, 24.7.1992, p. 9.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 143, 7.6.1991, p. 11.\nANNEX I\n\u2014 Vieille Kriek, Vieille Kriek-Lambic, Vieille Framboise-Lambic, Vieux fruit-Lambic/Oude Kriek, Oude Kriekenlambiek, Oude Frambozenlambiek, Oude Fruit-lambiek (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(1)\n\u2014 Vieille Gueuze, Vieille Gueuze-Lambic, Vieux Lambic/Oude Geuze, Oude Geuze-Lambiek, Oude Lambiek (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(2)\n\u2014 Faro (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(3)\n\u2014 Kriek, Kriek-Lambic, Framboise-Lambic, Fruit-Lambic/Kriek, Kriekenlambiek, Frambozenlambiek, Vruchtenlambiek (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(4)\n\u2014 Lambic, Gueuze-Lambic, Gueuze/Lambiek, Geuze-Lambiek, Geuze (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(5)\n\u2014 Mozzarella (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(6)\n\u2014 Jam\u00f3n Serrano (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(7)\n\u2014 Leche certificada de Granja (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(8)\n\u2014 Traditional Farmfresh Turkey (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(9)\n\u2014 Falukorv (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(10)\n\u2014 Sahti (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(11)\n\u2014 Panellets (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(12)\n\u2014 Kalakukko (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(13)\n\u2014 Karjalanpiirakka (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(14)\n\u2014 Hush\u00e5llsost (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 509/2006)\u00a0(15)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in OJ C 21, 21.1.1997, p. 5.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in OJ C 21, 21.1.1997, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in OJ C 21, 21.1.1997, p. 5.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in OJ C 21, 21.1.1997, p. 5.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in OJ C 21, 21.1.1997, p. 5.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0The main points of the specifications are set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2527/98 (OJ L 317, 26.11.1998, p. 14).
