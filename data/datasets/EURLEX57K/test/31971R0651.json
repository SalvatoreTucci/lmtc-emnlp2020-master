whereas other provisions of Regulations Nos 284/67/EEC and 901/67/EEC must be adapted to the situation produced by Regulation (EEC) No 2637/70 ; whereas those two Regulations should therefore be replaced by the provisions which follow;\nWhereas, to avoid distortions between the export refund system and the subsidy system provided for in Article 27 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the amount of refund should be calculated on the basis of the weight of seed containing the same percentages of moisture and impurities as standard quality seed;\nWhereas, to ensure uniform application of the refund system in all Member States, the methods for determining impurities and moisture, together with the techniques used, should be uniform throughout the Community;\nWhereas the denaturing for export of seeds harvested within the Community is of no economic interest to traders ; whereas it may therefore be assumed that seeds for export which have been denatured or which show signs of having been denatured have, in whole or in part, been imported ; whereas, to prevent fraudulent practices, these seeds must therefore be excluded from the export refund system;\nWhereas, to take particular terms of purchase in certain third countries into account, Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2637/70 provides for the period of validity of licences to be extended in respect of exports to those countries ; whereas to ensure that the products in respect of which this extension is granted are in fact those which are exported to those countries, payment of the refund should be subject to proof being furnished that the product has reached its destination;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats;
