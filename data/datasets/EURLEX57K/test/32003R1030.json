By Resolution 1478 (2003) of 6 May 2003, the Security Council decided to extend the application of those restrictive measures for a period of 12 months from 7 May 2003. It also decided to prohibit all imports of round logs and timber products originating in Liberia for a period of 10 months from 7 July 2003.\n(2) Certain of these measures fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council.\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 1318/2002 of 22 July 2002 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Liberia(2), implemented Resolutions 1343 (2001) and 1408 (2002) of the Security Council as far as the territory of the Community is concerned. That Regulation expired on 8 May 2003. It is now necessary to implement Resolution 1478 (2003). For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.\n(4) Member States should determine the sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation. Sanctions provided for should be proportionate, effective and dissuasive.\n(5) Since Council Regulation (EC) No 1318/2002 expired on 8 May 2003, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication and be applicable in line with the dates provided for in Common Position 2003/365/CFSP of 19 May 2003,", "main_body": ["1.

Each Member State shall be responsible for bringing proceedings against any natural or legal person, entity or body under its jurisdiction, in cases of violation of any of the prohibitions laid down in this Regulation by such person, entity or body.", "This Regulation shall apply:\n(a) within the territory of the Community, including its airspace;\n(b) on board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of a Member State;\n(c) to any person elsewhere who is a national of a Member State; and\n(d) to any legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State.", "1.
