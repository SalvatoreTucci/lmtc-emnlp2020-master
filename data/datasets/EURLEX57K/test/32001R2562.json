Such information shall include the following where they exist: names, telephone, telex and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses (Internet or X.400) which may be used for general communications between control centres;\n3. the position of vessels shall be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and a confidence interval of 99 %;\n4. when a vessel which is fishing under the Agreement and is the subject of satellite-based monitoring pursuant to Community legislation enters a fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, the subsequent position reports shall immediately be transmitted by the control centre of the flag State to the Malagasy fisheries monitoring centre (FMC) at intervals of no more than two hours. The messages concerned will be identified as position reports;\n5. the messages specified at point 4 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, without any further protocol. They shall be communicated in real time in the format set out in Appendix II;\n6. where the continuous satellite monitoring equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the skipper of the vessel shall transmit the information specified at point 4 to the control centre of the flag State in good time. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to send a position report every 12 hours while the vessel is in a fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar. The control centre of the flag State or the fishing vessel shall send these messages immediately to the FMC. The defective equipment shall be repaired or replaced as soon as the vessel completes its fishing trip or within one month at the latest. After this deadline, the vessel in question may not undertake any further fishing trips until the equipment has been repaired or replaced;\n7. the control centres of the flag States shall monitor the movements of their vessels in Malagasy waters at two-hourly intervals. If the vessels are not being monitored in accordance with the conditions laid down, the FMC shall be informed immediately and the procedure laid down at point 6 shall be applicable;\n8. if the FMC establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the information specified at point 4, the other party shall be informed immediately;\n9. the monitoring data communicated to the other party in accordance with these provisions is intended solely for the purposes of the Malagasy authorities in controlling and monitoring the Community fleet fishing under the Agreement. Such data may not under any circumstances be communicated to other parties;\n10. the parties agree to take all necessary steps to meet the message requirements laid down in points 4 and 6 as soon as possible, and in no case later than six months after these provisions enter into force;\n11. the parties agree to exchange upon request information on the equipment used for satellite monitoring, in order to ensure that each piece of equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other party for the purposes of these provisions;\n12. any dispute over the interpretation or application of these provisions shall be the subject of consultation between the parties within the Joint Committee referred to in Article 9 of the Agreement.\nThese provisions shall enter into force on 21 May 2001.\nAppendix I\nCoordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the Madagascar fishing zone\n>TABLE>\nAppendix II\nCommunication of VMS messages to Madagascar\nPOSITION REPORT\n>TABLE>\nCharacter set.
