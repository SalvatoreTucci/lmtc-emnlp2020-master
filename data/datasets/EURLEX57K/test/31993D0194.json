The  Belgian Government confirmed this definitive shutdown in its letter of 9 October 1992.\nThe financial aid schemes planned are intended to cover the social charges arising from the pit  closures, particularly underground work on safety and environmental protection.\nThe information contained in the notification from the Belgian Government regarding the financing  of the social benefit scheme in the coal industry reveals that the aid which the Belgian  Governement proposes to grant brings the ratio between the burden per mineworker in employment and  the benefits per person in receipt of benefit below the corresponding ratio in other industries.  This difference will amount to Bfrs 214  000  000 in 1993.\nConsequently, the limits specified in Article 7 are exceeded. This excess aid must be considered an  inherited liability. Pursuant to Article 8 of Decision No 2064/86/EEC, the aid may be considered  compatible with the common market provided that it does not exceed the costs incurred. The  information submitted by the Belgian Government made it possible to verify compliance with this  condition.\nThe aid to cover expenditure relating to the system of supplementary holiday for underground  workers is to be considered an inherited liability subject to compliance with the conditions laid  down in Article 8 of the Decision. The Commission verified the information submitted by the belgian  Government and ascertained that the aid will not exceed the expected costs.\nSince these measures are connected with the restructuring programme, the aid planned by the Belgian  Government complies with the provisions, objectives and criteria for implementation of Decision No  2064/86/ECSC.\nIII\nThe aid covered by this Decision is therefore compatible with the proper functioning of the  common market,", "main_body": ["The Belgian Government is hereby authorized to grand aid totalling  Bfrs 228  100  000 to the Belgian coal industry for the 1993 calendar year.
