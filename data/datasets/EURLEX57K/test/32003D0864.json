It recognised that a number of gaps exist in the knowledge of the epidemiology of campylobacter as a food-borne zoonosis. It indicated, in particular, that the efficiency of establishing strict hygiene barriers at poultry farm level should be documented, and that the efficiency of procedures to lower the prevalence of campylobacter at farm level needs further scrutiny.\n(5) The Swedish authorities presented in 2000, with a view to obtain financial support from the Community, a multiannual national surveillance programme of campylobacter in broilers, to estimate the baseline prevalence both in primary production and in the food chain, and to progressively reinforce implementation of hygienic measures in farms with a view to lower the prevalence at farm level and subsequently along the food chain. The programme started from 1 July 2001.\n(6) In the light of the importance of campylobacter as a zoonosis, it has been considered useful to provide Community financial assistance for an appropriate period of time within a maximum of four years, to cover certain costs incurred by Sweden and to collect valuable technical and scientific information. For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year. By Commission Decisions 2001/29/EC(3), 2001/866/EC(4) and 2002/989/EC(5), the Community provided financial assistance respectively for the second semester of the year 2001 and for the years 2002 and 2003.\n(7) The Swedish authorities have provided the necessary information on the implementation of the programme during the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 that shows its effective implementation.\n(8) The Swedish authorities presented on 5 September 2003 a programme for Community financial assistance during 2004, and a revised programme on 8 October 2003. On this basis, it appears appropriate to fix the financial assistance provided by the Community for the period 1 January 2004 up to 31 December 2004 to a maximum of EUR 160000.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(6), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(10) A financial contribution from the Community shall be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(11) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of the payment applications submitted in national currency as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(7).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
