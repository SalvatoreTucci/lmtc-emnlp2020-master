Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of category N3 shall be used on the road only if equipped with a device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 90 km/h; bearing in mind the technical tolerance  which is allowed, at the present state of technology, between the regulating value and the actual speed of traffic, the maximum speed on this device shall be set at 86 km/h.\n2.  Member States shall be authorized to set the maximum speed of the device at less than 85 km/h in vehicles used exclusively for the carriage of dangerous goods and registered in their territory.", "1.

Articles 2 and 3 shall also be applicable, at the latest from 1 January 1995, to vehicles registered between 1 January 1988 and 1 January 1994.\nHowever, where these vehicles are used exclusively for national transport operations, Articles 2 and 3 may be applied at the latest from 1 January 1996.", "1.  Until Community provisions on these matters are applied, the speed limitation devices referred to in Articles 2 and 3 must satisfy the technical requirements laid down by the competent national authorities.\n2.  Speed limitation devices shall be installed by workshops or bodies approved by the Member States.", "The requirements of Articles 2 and 3 do not apply to motor vehicles used by armed forces, civil defence, fire and other emergency services and forces responsible for maintaining public order.\nThe same shall apply for motor vehicles which:\n- by their construction, cannot drive faster than the limits provided for in Articles 2 and 3,\n- are used for scientific tests on roads,\n- are used only for public services in urban areas.", "1.  Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 October 1993. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen these provisions are adopted by Member States, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication.
