Point 7 of the recitals states that the Commission should terminate the Agreement of 28 July 1956 on the setting of through international railway tariffs for the carriage of coal and steel in transit through Swiss territory in accordance with the mandate conferred by the decision taken at the conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 17 June 1999, in coordination with the termination of the 1955 Agreement.\n(6) Additional protocols to this Agreement were drawn up on the occasion of the successive enlargements(5). Termination of the Agreement will result in the automatic cancellation of these additional protocols,", "main_body": ["The Commission, acting as the ECSC High Authority and on behalf of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the ECSC, hereby terminates the Agreement of 28 July 1956 on the setting of through international railway tariffs for the carriage of coal and steel in transit through Swiss territory."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 April 2002.\nFor the Commission\nLoyola de Palacio\nVice-President\n(1) OJ 17, 29.5.1957, p. 223/57.\n(2) OJ L 159, 25.6.1999, p. 52.\n(3) OJ L 288, 1.11.2001, p. 38.\n(4) OJ 9, 19.4.1955, p. 701/55.\n(5) OJ L 12, 18.1.1979, p. 15, OJ L 227, 12.8.1981, p. 11 and OJ L 397, 31.12.1987, p. 7."}
