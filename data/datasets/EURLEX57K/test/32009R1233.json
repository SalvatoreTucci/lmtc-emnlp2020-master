Community market prices for dairy products have also fallen significantly due to the crisis and changes in supply.\n(2) The fall of dairy product prices in the European Union have strongly affected the farm gate prices. A significant period is needed for a sustainable recovery. Therefore, it is appropriate to grant to the Member States a financial envelope in order to support the dairy farmers that are severely affected by the dairy crisis and encounter liquidity problems in these circumstances.\n(3) The financial envelope to each Member State shall be calculated based on the 2008/2009 milk production within national quotas. Member States should distribute that national amount available on the basis of objective criteria and in a non-discriminatory way, while avoiding any market and competition distortions.\n(4) The implementation of this Regulation should be carried out taking into account the institutional arrangements of each Member State.\n(5) The support to the dairy farmers should be granted as an intervention measure to regulate agricultural markets in accordance with Article 3(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(2).\n(6) For budgetary reasons, the Community will finance the expenditure incurred by Member States in relation to the financial support of dairy farmers only where such payments are made by a certain deadline.\n(7) In order to ensure transparency and the monitoring and proper administration of the national envelopes, the Member States should inform the Commission of the objective criteria used to determine the methods for granting support and the provisions taken to avoid distortion of the market.\n(8) In order to ensure that dairy farmers receive the support as soon as possible, the Member States should be enabled to implement this Regulation as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is necessary for it to enter into force without delay.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Member States shall use the amounts set out in the Annex to provide support to dairy farmers severely affected by the dairy crisis on the basis of objective criteria and in a non-discriminatory way, provided that these payments do not cause distortion of competition.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures provided for in Article 1 of this Regulation shall be deemed to be intervention measures intended to regulate agricultural markets within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Payments in relation to the support referred to in Article 1 shall be made by the Member States by 30 June 2010 at the latest.", "As regards the support provided for in Article 1, the Member States shall communicate to the Commission:\n(a) without delay and no later than 31 March 2010, a description of the objective criteria used to determine the methods for granting support and the provisions taken to avoid distortion of the market;\n(b) no later than 30 August 2010, the total amounts of aid paid and the number and type of beneficiaries.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\nANNEX\u00a0(1)\nmillion EUR\nBE 7,212824\nBG 1,842622\nCZ 5,792943\nDK 9,859564\nDE 61,203560\nEE 1,302069\nIE 11,502500\nEL 1,581891\nES 12,792178\nFR 51,127334\nIT 23,031475\nCY 0,316812\nLV 1,445181\nLT 3,099461\nLU 0,597066\nHU 3,565265\nMT 0,084511\nNL 24,586045\nAT 6,052604\nPL 20,211209\nPT 4,084693\nRO 5,010401\nSI 1,143094\nSK 2,034727\nFI 4,831752\nSE 6,427521\nUK 29,260698\nEU-27 300,000000\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Based on the 2008/2009 milk production within national quotas."}
