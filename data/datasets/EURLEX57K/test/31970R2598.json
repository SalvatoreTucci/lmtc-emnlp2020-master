GENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n1. Under the provisions of Article 2 (2) of the above-mentioned Regulation the expenditure to be entered in the accounts is to be that incurred directly in meeting the cost of work, services and supplies in connection with the construction, upkeep, running and administration of infrastructure. These provisions therefore exclude entry in those accounts of yearly appropriations for renewal, insurance or reserve funds set up to meet future expenditure.\n2. For any given infrastructure, the expenditure to be taken into account under the various headings in the forms of accounts is the total expenditure incurred in respect of that infrastructure, irrespective of how the expenditure is financed.\nNevertheless, where in respect of the same installation expenditure is borne either directly or indirectly by two or more infrastructure administrations, only such net expenditure as is properly chargeable to each administration should be included in its accounts. Also, where  compensation is granted by the public authorities to certain infrastructure administrations, the amount of such compensation is to be deducted from the expenditure incurred by those administrations.\n3. The value of dismantled installations or equipment, whether sold or used again, is to be set off against the expenditure entered under the appropriate headings in the forms of accounts, subject, in the case of railways, to any special provisions in this connection in agreements made between railway undertakings and public authorities.\n4. Expenditure relating to the purchase, upkeep and operation of specialised equipment and tools used by the infrastructure department and expenditure relating to transport used for service purposes by that department should be entered under the appropriate headings in the forms of accounts or, failing that, under the heading \"General expenses\".\n5. Workshop and warehousing charges should normally be included in the invoice prices of the articles and materials supplied to the infrastructure department. Where such direct charging is not possible, these charges should be entered under the heading \"General expenses\".\nB. DESCRIPTION OF ITEMS TO BE ENTERED UNDER THE VARIOUS HEADINGS\n1. Headings common to all three modes of transport\n- Investment expenditure (headings A1, B1, C1)\nInvestment expenditure comprises the total expenditure (in respect of staff, and goods and services provided by third parties) in connection with the construction, extension, reconstruction and renewal of infrastructure installations, including incidental expenses and research costs connected with such work. This definition does not, however, preclude entry pursuant to provisions of national law of certain minor investment expenditure under the heading \"Current expenditure\".\n- Current expenditure (headings A2, B2, C2)\nCurrent expenditure comprises the total expenditure (in respect of staff, and goods and services provided by third parties) in connection with the upkeep and operation of infrastructure.\n- General expenses (headings A3, B4, C4)\nGeneral expenses comprise the total expenditure of the departments concerned with administration, supervision and inspection specifically responsible for the creation and management of infrastructure, and also that portion of the expenditure of the general administrative departments directly concerned which is chargeable to infrastructure. General expenses also cover all other expenditure which has not been taken into account directly under any other heading in the forms of accounts.\nThe expenses covered include in particular the following:      - staff remuneration costs and operating costs of central, regional and local administrative and technical departments, costs in connection with supervision and taking over of works;\n- payments in respect of retirement pensions for permanent staff, and other employers' payments (family allowances, employers' health insurance contributions, accident insurance premiums, contributions to pension schemes for staff other than permanent staff, etc.);\n- expenditure relating to service accomodation provided for staff employed in the infrastructure department, less any rents charged;\n- expenditure relating to service buildings of the repair and maintenance department (in particular shelters, tool depots) in so far as this has not been taken into account directly under other headings in the forms of accounts.\n2. Headings for road transport only\n- Expenditure in respect of the upkeep of road surfaces (heading B20)\nThis covers principally expenditure in respect of works in connection with the mechanical resistance of roads to the loads applied to them. It includes both expenditure in respect of repairs to the surface for flexible pavements and expenditure in respect of the upkeep of section for rigid pavements.\n- Traffic police (heading B3)\nExpenditure on traffic police comprises the total expenditure of police services chargeable to their traffic supervision and control functions, including expenditure on buildings, vehicles and equipment for the special use of such services.\n3. Heading for inland waterway only\n- Waterway police (heading C3)\nExpenditure on waterway police comprises the total expenditure in respect of waterway police, including expenditure on buildings, wharfs and vessels for the special use of such services."}
