The seasonal nature of Emmental, Gruy\u0102\u00a8re, Pecorino Romano, Kefalotyri and Kasseri cheese production is aggravated by the fact that the seasonality of consumption is the inverse of the seasonality of production. The fragmented production of such cheeses further aggravates the consequences of that seasonality. Therefore, provision should be made for recourse to seasonal storage in respect of a quanity corresponding to the difference between summer and winter production.\n(2) The types of cheeses eligible for aid and the maximum quantities which may benefit from it should be laid down, as well as the duration of the contracts in relation to the real requirements of the market and the keeping qualities of the cheeses in question.\n(3) It is necessary to specify the terms of the storage contract and the measures to enable the cheese covered by a contract to be identified and subjected to checks. The amounts of private storage aid must be fixed taking account of storage costs and the likely trend of market prices.\n(4) Detailed rules should also be laid down regarding documentation, accounting and the frequency and nature of checks. In this connection, it should be laid down that the Member States may provide that the costs of controls be fully or in part charged to the contractor.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThis Regulation lays down the detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the granting, under Article 9 of that Regulation, of private storage aid for certain cheeses (hereinafter referred to as \"aid\") in the 2001/02 marketing year.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a) \"storage lot\" means a quantity of cheese weighing at least two tonnes, of the same type and taken into storage in a single storage depot on a single day;\n(b) \"day of commencement of contractual storage\" means the day following that of entry into storage;\n(c) \"last day of contractual storage\" means the day before that of removal from storage.", "Cheeses eligible for aid\n1.

Removal from storage shall be in whole storage lots.\n3. Where, at the end of the first 60 days of contractual storage, the deterioration in the quality of the cheese is greater than is normal in store, contractors may be authorised, once per storage lot, to replace the defective quantity, at their own expense.\nIf checks during storage or on removal reveal defective quantities, no aid may be paid for those quantities. In addition, the part of the lot which is still eligible for aid may not be less than two tonnes. The same rule shall apply where part of a lot is removed before the start of the period of removal from storage referred to in paragraph 1 or before expiry of the minimum storage period referred to in Article 8(2).\n4.

The competent agency shall make an unannounced check, by sampling, to ensure that the products are present in the storage depot. The sample concerned must be representative and must correspond to at least 10 % of the overall quantity under contract for a private storage aid measure.\nSuch checks must include, in addition to an examination of the accounts referred to in Article 6(3), a physical check of the weight and type of products and their identification. Such physical checks must relate to at least 5 % of the quantity subjected to the unannounced check.\n3. At the end of the contractual storage period, the competent agency shall check to see that products are present. However, where the products are still in storage after expiry of the maximum contractual storage period, this check may be made when the products are removed from storage.\nFor the purposes of the check referred to in the first subparagraph, the contractor shall inform the competent agency, indicating the storage lots concerned, at least five working days before:\n(i) the expiry of the contractual storage period, or\n(ii) the start of the removal operations, where these take place during or after the contractual storage period.\nThe Member State may accept a shorter time limit than five working days.\n4.
