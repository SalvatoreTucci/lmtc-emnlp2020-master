To this end, the relative intervention price levels of the two products should be adjusted.\n(3) The target price, constituted especially by the intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder, served as an indication for the support level; since intervention for both products is now only applied for a maximum quantity and during a limited period of the year, it is indicated to abolish the target price.\n(4) To avoid creation of an artificial outlet of massive recourse to intervention a fixed quantity ceiling should be set for intervention purchases of butter.\n(5) The direct payment measures in support of milk producers' incomes having been adjusted and set out in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers(4), they need therefore to be withdrawn from Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1) Article 3 is repealed.\n2) Article 4(1) shall be replaced by the following:\n\"1.
