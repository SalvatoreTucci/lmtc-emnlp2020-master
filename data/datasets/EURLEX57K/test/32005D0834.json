Those checks should therefore continue to be considered as equivalent.\n(3) The Decision 97/788/EC expired on 30 June 2005. In order to avoid disruption of trade with these third countries, it is necessary that this Decision takes effect from 1 July 2005.\n(4) This Decision should not prevent Community findings on equivalence from being revoked or the extension of their period of validity from being refused when the conditions on which they are based are not, or cease to be, satisfied.\n(5) The measures necessary for implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(8).\n(6) Directive 2004/117/EC\u00a0(9) extended the scope of Community seed equivalence regime to all categories of seeds including seed of generations prior to basic seed. Accordingly, it is appropriate to amend Decision 2003/17/EC\u00a0(10), in order to align the provisions of that Decision with the modified provisions of the seeds marketing Directives,", "main_body": ["The official checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties carried out in the third countries and by the authorities, listed in the Annex, for the species covered by the Directives referred to for each of those countries shall afford the same guarantees as those carried out by the Member States.", "Amendments to the Annex, with the exception of those concerning the first column of the table, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(2).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry set up by Article 1 of Decision 66/399/EEC\u00a0(11), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Committee\u2019.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nThe period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at one month.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.", "In Decision 2003/17/EC Articles 1 and 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 1\nField inspections concerning the seed-producing crops of the species specified in Annex I carried out in the third countries listed in that Annex shall be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC provided that they:\n(a) are carried out officially by the authorities listed in Annex I, or under the official supervision of those authorities;\n(b) satisfy the conditions laid down in point A of Annex\u00a0II.", "Seed of the species specified in Annex I, produced in the third countries listed in that Annex and officially certified by the authorities listed in that Annex shall be considered equivalent to seed complying with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC, if it satisfies the conditions laid down in point B of Annex II.\u2019", "This Decision shall apply from 1 July 2005.\nHowever, Article 4 shall apply as from 1 October 2005.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
