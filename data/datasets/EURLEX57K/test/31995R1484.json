whereas these additional import duties may be imposed in particular if the  import prices fall below the trigger prices;\nWhereas, therefore, specific implementing rules should be laid down for the poultrymeat and egg  sectors as well as for egg albumin and the trigger prices should be published;\nWhereas the import prices to be taken into consideration for imposing an additional import duty  should be checked against the representative prices on the world market or on the Community import  market for the products in question;
