The application was accompanied by the relevant supporting data. The Commission forwarded that application to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019).\n(3) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 15 March 2011 that the increase of the minimum concentration from 1,6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 to 1,6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 CFU/g is unlikely to introduce new hazards and that the modified composition is compatible with formic acid. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1137/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1137/2007 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 September 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 265, 2.10.2007, p. 5.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1137/2007 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
