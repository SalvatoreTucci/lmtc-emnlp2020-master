In that report it came to the conclusion that the extension of use of this algal oil meets the criteria for novel food set out in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(4) On 9 July 2013, the Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to the other Member States.\n(5) Reasoned objections were raised within the 60-day period laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(6) On 25 March 2014, the Commission consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asking it to carry out an additional assessment of the extension of use of DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. as a novel food ingredient in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(7) On 18 September 2014, EFSA adopted a scientific opinion on the extension of use for DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. as a novel food ingredient\u00a0(2), concluding that it is safe under the proposed uses and use levels.\n(8) That opinion gives sufficient grounds to establish that DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. in the proposed uses and use levels complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0258/97.\n(9) Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) lays down requirements on food supplements. The use of DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. should be authorised without prejudice to the requirements of that legislation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. as specified in Annex I may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient for the use defined and at the maximum level established in Annex II without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC.", "The designation of DHA- and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018DHA and EPA-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp.\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to DSM Nutritional Products, 6480 Dobbin Road, Columbia, MD 21045, USA."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a043, 14.2.1997, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(10):3843.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements (OJ L\u00a0183, 12.7.2002, p.\u00a051).\nANNEX I\nSpecification of DHA (docosahexaneoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp.\nTest Specification\nAcid value Not more than 0,5\u00a0mg KOH/g\nPeroxide value (PV) Not more than 5,0 meq/kg oil\nMoisture and volatiles Not more than 0,05 %\nUnsaponifiables Not more than 4,5 %\nTrans-fatty acids Not more than 1,0 %\nDHA content Not less than 22,5 %\nEPA content Not less than 10 %\nANNEX II\nAuthorised uses of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)-rich oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp.\nFood category Maximum use level of DHA and EPA (mg/day)\nFood supplements 3\u00a0000 mg as recommended by the manufacturer for adult population excluding pregnant and lactating women"}
