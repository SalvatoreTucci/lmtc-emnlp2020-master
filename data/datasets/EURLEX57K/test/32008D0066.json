DGPC 070521 000604), Portugal introduced a programme to strengthen in 2008 its inspection infrastructures for checks on plants and plant products coming from third countries\u00a0(2). It has applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution for 2008 for that programme in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 998/2002 of 11 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a Community financial contribution for Member States in order to strengthen inspection infrastructures for plant-health checks on plants and plant products coming from third countries\u00a0(3).\n(3) The technical information provided by Portugal has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively. The Commission has prepared a list of eligible inspection posts strengthening programmes, which give details of the amount of the proposed Community financial contribution to each programme. The information has also been examined by the Standing Committee on Plant Health.\n(4) After assessment of the programme, the Commission has concluded that the conditions and criteria set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and Regulation (EC) No 998/2002 for the grant of a Community financial contribution have been met.\n(5) Accordingly, it is appropriate to allocate a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure of that programme for 2008 by Portugal.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The allocation of a Community financial contribution to cover expenditure to be incurred in 2008 by Portugal for its programme for strengthening inspection posts is hereby approved.", "The maximum amount of the Community financial contribution as provided for in Article 1 shall be EUR 25\u00a0960 and shall be as set out in the Annex.", "The Community financial contribution to the programme as set out in the Annex shall only be paid when:\n(a) evidence of the purchase and/or improvement of the equipment and/or facilities listed in the programme has been given by the Member State concerned to the Commission by appropriate documentation; and\n(b) a request for payment of the Community financial contribution has been submitted by the Member State concerned to the Commission, in accordance with the rules provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2002.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
