It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products appearing in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed either in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to amended Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 respectively, are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2002.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(4) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n(5) OJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 160, 18.6.2002, p. 16.\n(7) OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n(8) OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.\n(9) OJ L 242, 12.9.2001, p. 3.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 28 June 2002 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n>TABLE>"}
