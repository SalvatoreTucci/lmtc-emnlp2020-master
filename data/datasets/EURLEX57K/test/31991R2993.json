Imports of products shipped from India to the Community after the entry into force of this Regulation shall be subject to the double-checking system described in Annex VI to Regulation (EEC) No 4136/86.\n3. All quantities of products shipped from India to the Community on or after 18 September 1991 and released for free circulation shall be deducted from the quantitative limits laid down. These provisional limits shall not, however, prevent the  importation of products covered by them but shipped from India before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply until 17 December 1991.
