To that end, specific provisions should be laid down to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) and to improve the effective monitoring of marketing standards.\n(3) Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that light and heat adversely affect the quality of olive oils. Specific storage conditions should therefore be clearly indicated on the label to ensure that the consumer is well-informed about the best conditions for preservation.\n(4) In order to help the consumer to select products, it is crucial that the mandatory particulars indicated on the label are easily readable. Rules should therefore be laid down on readability and the concentration of mandatory information within the main field of vision.\n(5) In order to enable the consumer to be sure that the product is fresh, the optional marking of the harvest year should only appear on the label when 100\u00a0% of the packaging contents come from that harvest.\n(6) In the interests of simplification, it should be laid down that the labelling of food products preserved exclusively in olive oil is no longer required to state the percentage of oil added in relation to the total net weight of the foodstuff.\n(7) In order to ensure consistency between Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91\u00a0(4) and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012, particularly as regards the tolerance for the result of checks, the relevant provision of that Implementing Regulation should be amended accordingly.\n(8) Member States must carry out checks to ensure that the markings on the labels are correct and to ensure compliance with this Regulation. To that end, checks on the conformity of the product\u2019s sale name with the contents of the container should be reinforced and further harmonised on the basis of risk analysis, as should corresponding penalties. This approach should also help to combat fraud by introducing minimum control requirements for all Member States and by standardising the reports to be sent to the Commission.\n(9) Member States should lay down penalties at national level. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(10) Products manufactured and labelled in the Union or imported into the Union before the application of this Regulation but in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 should be covered by a transitional period so that operators can use up their existing stock of containers and sell products which are already packaged.\n(11) The Commission has developed an information system which makes it possible to manage documents and procedures electronically within the framework of its internal operation and in its relations with the authorities involved in the common agricultural policy. That system is regarded as fulfilling the communication requirements of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 792/2009\u00a0(5).\n(12) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) the following Articles 4a and 4b shall be inserted:\n(2) the following point (e) shall be added to the first paragraph of Article 5:\n\u2018(e) Regarding oils subject to point 1(a) and (b) of Annex XVI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the harvesting year may be shown only if 100\u00a0% of the contents of the container come from that harvest.\u2019;\n(3) the first subparagraph of Article 6(2) shall be replaced by the following:\n(4) in Article 7, the second paragraph shall be deleted;\n(5) the following Article 8a shall be inserted:\n(6) the first subparagraph of Article 9(1) shall be replaced by the following:\n(7) Article 10 shall be replaced by the following:\n(a) requests for verifications received in accordance with Article 8(2);\n(b) verifications started and those started in previous marketing years and still ongoing;\n(c) verifications started in accordance with Article 8a using the model set out in Annex XXI to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91;\n(d) the follow-up to the verifications carried out and the penalties applied.\n(8) the following Article 10a shall be inserted:", "Products which comply with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 and which have been manufactured and labelled in the Union or imported into the Union and put into free circulation before 13 December 2014 may be marketed until all stocks are used up.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 13 December 2014.
