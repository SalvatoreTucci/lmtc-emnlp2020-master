Previous procedure\n(1) By Regulation (EC) No 2674/94 (3), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of furazolidone originating in the People's Republic of China following a complaint lodged by Orphahell BV, the sole Community producer of the product concerned.\nB. Prohibition of the product concerned, repeal of the existing measures\n(2) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1442/95 of 26 June 1995 amending Annexes I, II, III and IV of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (4), the use of the product concerned in animal foodstuffs throughout the Community was prohibited.\n(3) As a result, the complainant informed the Commission that it had decided to cease production of furazolidone. There is therefore no longer any reason for maintaining Regulation (EC) No 2674/94 as Community production of furazolidone has ceased and the sale and import of the product concerned is banned.\nC. Repeal of anti-dumping duties\n(4) In view of the foregoing, the anti-dumping duty in force on imports of furazolidone originating in the People's Republic of China should be repealed, thereby terminating the proceeding,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2674/94 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 March 1996.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nS.
