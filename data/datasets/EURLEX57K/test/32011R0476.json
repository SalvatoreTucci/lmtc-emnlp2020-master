The ICES advice was reviewed by the STECF, which delivered its conclusions to the Commission on 24 February 2011. In accordance with that advice, the catch limit for management area 1 should be increased to 320\u00a0000 tonnes and the catch limit for management area 2 decreased to 34\u00a0000 tonnes. The STECF also considered it appropriate to establish catch limits of 10\u00a0000 tonnes and 420 tonnes respectively in management areas 4 and 6\n(4) The STECF considered that the catch limits for management areas 3 and 7 should be zero. However in supplementary advice delivered on 17 March 2011, the STECF considered that a catch limit of 10\u00a0000 tonnes could be allowed in management area 3 in order to conduct a monitoring fishery in that area.\n(5) Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 27.1.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex IA to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 is amended as follows:\nThe entry concerning the species sandeel in EU waters of ICES zones IIa, IIIa and IV is replaced by the following:\nSpecies : Sandeel and associated by-catches\nZone : EU waters of IIa, IIIa and IV\u00a0(1)\nSpecies : Sandeel and associated by-catches\nZone : EU waters of IIa, IIIa and IV\u00a0(1)\nDenmark 331\u00a0731\u00a0(2) Analytical TAC\nUnited Kingdom 7\u00a0251\u00a0(2)\nGermany 507\u00a0(2)\nSweden 12\u00a0181\u00a0(2)\nNot allocated 2\u00a0750\u00a0(3)\nEU 351\u00a0670\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(4)\nNorway 20\u00a0000\nTAC 374\u00a0420\nSpecial conditions:\nZone : EU waters of sandeel management areas\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n(SAN/*234_1) (SAN/*234_2) (SAN/*234_3) (SAN/*234_4) (SAN/*234_5) (SAN/*234_6) (SAN/*234_7)\nDenmark 284\u00a0068 28\u00a0022 9\u00a0434 9\u00a0434 0 395 0\nUnited Kingdom 6\u00a0209 613 206 206 0 9 0\nGermany 435 43 14 14 0 1 0\nSweden 10\u00a0431 1\u00a0029 346 346 0 15 0\nEU 301\u00a0143 29\u00a0707 10\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 0 420 0\nNorway 16\u00a0626 3\u00a0774 0 0 0 0 0\nNot allocated 2\u00a0231 519 0 0 0 0 0\nTotal 320\u00a0000 34\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 0 420 0\nZone : EU waters of sandeel management areas\nZone : EU waters of sandeel management areas\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n(SAN/*234_1) (SAN/*234_2) (SAN/*234_3) (SAN/*234_4) (SAN/*234_5) (SAN/*234_6) (SAN/*234_7)\nDenmark 284\u00a0068 28\u00a0022 9\u00a0434 9\u00a0434 0 395 0\nUnited Kingdom 6\u00a0209 613 206 206 0 9 0\nGermany 435 43 14 14 0 1 0\nSweden 10\u00a0431 1\u00a0029 346 346 0 15 0\nEU 301\u00a0143 29\u00a0707 10\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 0 420 0\nNorway 16\u00a0626 3\u00a0774 0 0 0 0 0\nNot allocated 2\u00a0231 519 0 0 0 0 0\nTotal 320\u00a0000 34\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 10\u00a0000 0 420 0"}
