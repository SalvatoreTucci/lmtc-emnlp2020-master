Winsl. et al. should be extended for a further period to enable the responsible official bodies of Ireland and Italy to complete their efforts to eradicate the harmful organism in the area around Dublin and in the region of Apulia, respectively;\nWhereas it should be established that the extension of the recognition beyond the dates referred to in Article 1, and any amendment to the list of protected zones referred to in Article 1, shall be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16a of Directive 77/93/EEC, taking into account the results of appropriate surveys based on Community conditions and monitored by Commission experts;\nWhereas in absence of any extension of the recognition beyond the dates referred to in Article 1, the relevant protected zones cease on these dates, to be 'protected zones` within the meaning of Directive 77/93/EEC, including its Annexes;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 92/76/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
