The following Articles 2b and 2c are inserted:\n(a) the keeping of poultry in the open air, provided the poultry are supplied with feed and water indoors or under a shelter which sufficiently discourages the landing of wild birds and thereby prevents contact by wild birds with the feed or water intended for the poultry;\n(b) the use of outdoor water reservoirs if they are required for animal welfare reasons for certain poultry and are sufficiently screened against wild waterfowl;\n(c) the provision of water from surface water accessed by wild waterfowl after treatment that would ensure inactivation of the possible avian influenza virus;\n(d) the use of decoy birds during bird-hunting:\n(i) by decoy bird holders registered with the competent authority, under the strict supervision of the competent authority for the attraction of wild birds intended for sampling pursuant to the Member States\u2019 programmes for avian influenza surveys in poultry and wild birds as provided for in Decision 2005/732/EC; or\n(ii) in accordance with appropriate biosecurity measures, which include:\n\u2014 identification of the individual decoy birds by a ringing system,\n\u2014 implementation of a specific surveillance system for decoy birds,\n\u2014 the recording and reporting of the health status of decoy birds and laboratory testing for avian influenza in the case of deaths of such birds and at the end of the bird-hunting season,\n\u2014 strict separation between decoy birds and domestic poultry and other captive birds circuit,\n\u2014 cleansing and disinfection of the means of transport and equipment used for the transport of decoy birds and for trips in the areas where decoy birds are placed,\n\u2014 restrictions and control of movements of decoy birds, in particular to prevent contacts with different open waters,\n\u2014 the development and implementation of \u201cguidelines of good biosecurity practises\u201d detailing the measures provided for in the first to sixth indents,\n\u2014 implementation of a reporting system on the data obtained from the measures referred to in the first, second, and third indents.", "Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
