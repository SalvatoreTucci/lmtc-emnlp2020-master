In that report it came to the conclusion that, in the light of other pending applications concerning lycopene, an additional assessment is required in order to assure that an authorisation for use of the different lycopenes as novel food ingredients is granted under the same terms.\n(2) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 11 February 2008.\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority was consulted and issued its opinion on 4 December 2008.\n(4) In its opinion EFSA came to the conclusion, because lycopene may undergo oxidative changes, it needs to be formulated as suspensions in edible oils, directly compressible or water dispersible powders. Sufficient antioxidative protection has to be ascertained.\n(5) EFSA also concluded that the consumption of lycopene by the average user will stay below the acceptable daily intake (ADI), but that some users of lycopene may exceed the ADI. Therefore, it also appears appropriate to collect intake data for a number of years following the authorisation in order to review this authorisation in the light of any further information on the safety of lycopene and its consumption. Particular attention should be given to the collection of data regarding levels of lycopene in breakfast cereals. However, this requirement under the present Decision, applies to the use of lycopene as a novel food ingredient and not to the use of lycopene as a food colour, that falls within the scope of Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\u00a0(2).\n(6) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that the lycopene from Blakeslea trispora complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(7) The company Vitatene agreed that Commission Decision 2006/721/EC\u00a0(3) will be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lycopene from Blakeslea trispora (hereinafter referred to as the product), as specified in Annex I, may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient to be used in the foods listed in Annex II.", "The designation of the novel food ingredient authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018lycopene\u2019.", "The company Vitatene shall establish a monitoring programme accompanying the marketing of the product. This programme shall encompass information about use levels of lycopene in foods as specified in Annex III.\nThe data collected shall be made available to the Commission and Member States. In the light of new information and a report of EFSA, at the latest in the year 2014 the use of lycopene as an ingredient in foods shall be reviewed.", "Decision 2006/721/EC is herewith repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to Vitatene SAU, Avda.
