It is, however, necessary to maintain traceability of the flows of the quantities obtained under the invitation to tender.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1573/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1573/2005 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92, proof that the rye has been properly used shall be provided where it is stored in a bioethanol processing undertaking, its processing into bioethanol has taken place and the biofuel producer shows that this bioethanol has been processed into biofuel.
