It has since become evident that there is the need to define a new calendar for the temporary scheme for restructuring of the sugar industry to take into account the consequences of the global financial crisis on the economies of certain Member States and the sudden important changes in the national restructuring programmes that started in 2008 and are still ongoing.\n(2) The second subparagraph of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 provides that any remaining amounts in the temporary restructuring fund after the financing of measures are transferred to the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. In order to ensure sound financial and budgetary management of the remaining funds, it is appropriate to postpone the existing final dates for eligibility of payments made under the restructuring fund in case the undertakings concerned update their restructuring plans.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 968/2006 should, therefore, be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 968/2006 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 6(1), the following second subparagraph is added:\n2. in Article 14, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n3. in Article 17, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n4. in Article 22, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n5. in Article 24, the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n6. a new Article 22b is added in Chapter V:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 42.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 30.6.2006, p. 32."}
