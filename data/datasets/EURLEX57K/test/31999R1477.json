The stated activity is not less than 5 units/mg, one unit being defined as the amount that produces 1 \u03bcmol of NH3 per minute at 37 \u00b0C from 5 g/l urea at pH 4.\n3. Origin: Lactobacillus fermentum\n4. Area of application: breaking down urea present in wine intended for prolonged ageing, where its initial urea concentration is higher than 1 mg/l.\n5. Maximum quantity to be used: 75 mg of enzyme preparation per litre of wine treated, not exceeding 375 units of urease per litre of wine.
