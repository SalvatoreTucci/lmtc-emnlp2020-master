Part I of the Annex lists the names of the countries and territories covered by a specific Decision under Directive 91/493/EEC(5) and part II names those qualifying under Article 2(2) of Decision 95/408/EC.\n(2) Commission Decisions 2002/24/EC(6), 2002/25/EC(7), 2002/26/EC(8) and 2002/27/EC(9) set specific import conditions for fishery and aquaculture products originating in Slovenia, Croatia, Gabon and Turkey, respectively. The mentioned countries should therefore be added to part I of the Annex.\n(3) The Republic of Armenia has provided information that its fishery products satisfy sanitary conditions equivalent to those of the Community, and is able to guarantee that the fishery products it will export to the Community meet the health requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC; it is therefore necessary to modify the above list to include this country in Part II of the list. Nevertheless, following the information and the guarantees received from the competent authorities of this country it is necessary to limit the imports of fishery products authorised to live crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) intended for direct human consumption only.\n(4) Decisions 2002/24/EC, 2002/25/EC, 2002/26/EC and 2002/27/EC will enter into force 60 days after their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities providing for the necessary transitional period and it is necessary to apply the same delay for the implementation of the present Decision. Nevertheless, since the import of fishery products from the Republic of Armenia will be authorised for the first time by the present Decision there is no need for such transitional period, imports from this country may be permitted immediately.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to the present Decision replaces the Annex to Decision 97/296/EC.", "1.
