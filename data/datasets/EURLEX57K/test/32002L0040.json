The label referred to in Article 2(1) of Directive 92/75/EEC shall be as specified in Annex I to this Directive.\nThe label shall be placed on the door of the appliance, in such a way as to be clearly visible and not obscured. For multi-cavity ovens, each cavity shall have its own label, except a cavity which does not fall within the scope of the harmonised standards referred to in Article 2.\n3. The content and format of the fiche referred to in Article 2(1) of Directive 92/75/EEC shall be as specified in Annex II to this Directive.\n4. Where the appliances are offered for sale, hire, or hire purchase by way of a printed or written communication or by other means whereby the potential customer cannot be expected to see the appliance displayed, such as a written offer, a mail order catalogue, advertisements on the Internet or other electronic media, that communication shall include all the information specified in Annex III.\nThis requirement shall also apply in respect of offers for built-in ovens for integrated kitchens.\n5. The energy efficiency class of each cavity of an oven shall be determined in accordance with Annex IV.\n6. The appropriate terms to be used on the label and the fiche as referred to in Article 2(1) of Directive 92/75/EEC shall be selected from the table set out in Annex V to this Directive.", "Member States shall permit, until 30 June 2003, the placing on the market, the marketing and/or the display of products and the distribution of communications referred to in Article 3(4) which do not conform to this Directive.", "1. Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2002, the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nThey shall apply those provisions with effect from 1 January 2003.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.", "Directive 79/531/EEC is repealed with effect from 1 January 2003.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 May 2002.\nFor the Commission\nLoyola De Palacio\nVice-President\n(1) OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 16.\n(2) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n(3) OJ L 217, 5.8.1998, p. 18.\n(4) OJ L 344, 6.12.1986, p. 24.\n(5) OJ L 145, 13.6.1979, p. 7.\nANNEX I\nLABEL\nLabel design\n1.
