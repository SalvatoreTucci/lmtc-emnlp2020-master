Eating habits have changed and, owing to its current size, the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 is considered too large as a portion of confectionery, especially as it is now baked and consumed throughout the year, and not only on Saint Martin\u2019s day. Reducing the lower weight limit will boost demand and hence broaden the range of consumers, and this should also help to disseminate information about the PGI scheme.\nReducing the weight of the product will in no way affect the specific features of the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 as defined in point 5.2 of the Single Document, or its taste.\nThis amendment also means that it is necessary to delete the following sentence relating to the dimensions of the croissant from point 3.2 of the Single Document: \u2018(It \u2026) fits within a square of approximately 14x14\u00a0cm, with a height at its thickest point of approximately 7\u00a0cm and a width of approximately 10\u00a0cm\u2019. This is a consequence of the change in the permitted weight of the product, and there is no justification for maintaining the dimensions indicated in this case. Nor is there any point in indicating other dimensions, as they would be difficult to specify in view of such a wide range of weights. This is partly due to the baking process, since the craftsmen bakers have no influence over the extent to which the dough increases in volume. It should be pointed out that the deletion of requirements relating to the product\u2019s dimensions will in no way affect its specific shape, which must be maintained regardless of its weight.\nANNEX II\nCONSOLIDATED SINGLE DOCUMENT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(1)\n\u2018ROGAL \u015aWI\u0118TOMARCI\u0143SKI\u2019\nEC No: PL-PGI-0105-01023-24.07.2012\nPGI (X) PDO ( )\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019\nThe name \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 meets the requirements of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 and is the name customarily used to describe a croissant baked in Pozna\u0144, the regional capital of Wielkopolska, and in a few surrounding towns.

Its cross-section is oval. It weighs between 150 and 250\u00a0g. Its surface colour varies from dark golden to light brown. The dough has a cream colour and the filling is creamy brown \u2013 varying from pale to dark creamy brown. The baked dough is of elastic consistency and flaky, and presents a porous cross-section, with visible layers. Closer to the middle, rolls of dough are interspersed with a poppy-seed filling. At its centre, the pastry is filled with a poppy-seed filling which is moist to the touch. The characteristic taste and smell \u2013 sweet and with a slight almond taste \u2013 derive from the ingredients it contains: the yeast dough and the poppy-seed filling.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nThe following ingredients are used to make a \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019:\n\u2014 For the dough: wheat flour, margarine, milk, eggs, sugar, yeast, salt, lemon flavouring.\n\u2014 For the filling: white poppy seeds, sugar, crumbs, egg pulp, margarine, raisins, nuts, fruit in syrup or candied fruit (sweet cherries, pear, orange peel), almond flavouring.\n\u2014 Other ingredients (decorative layer): icing, chopped nuts.\nThe flour should contain more than 27\u00a0% of elastic gluten.

This custom originates in Pozna\u0144 and the surrounding area.\nSaint Martin\u2019s Day celebrations date from the 16th century and are linked to the end of the agricultural year. The main street in Pozna\u0144 is named after Saint Martin, and festivities in his honour take place each year and form part of the heritage of the city\u2019s entire community.\nThe reputation of \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 has been established by the confectioners and bakers of Pozna\u0144, the capital of Wielkopolska, and the surrounding area. Bakers have been offering this product to the city\u2019s inhabitants on Saint Martin\u2019s Day for 150 years. The tradition has spread to neighbouring districts in Wielkopolskie Province.\nOver time the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 has become available throughout the year, but its production and consumption continue to be concentrated around Saint Martin\u2019s Day.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe typical characteristics of the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 are linked to the knowledge and skills of producers, who bake them in accordance with a specification. The product possesses a specific quality resulting from its external appearance, shape, taste and smell and the use of a special ingredient \u2013 white poppy seeds \u2013 for the filling.\nA yeast-based croissant dough is used. This is a yeast dough which, after rising and cooling, is rolled together with margarine to produce a croissant dough which, during baking, acquires a light, characteristically flaky texture. In accordance with what is called the \u2018three times three\u2019 recipe, two-thirds of the dough is spread with a layer of margarine and the dough is then folded in three so that there are three layers of dough interspersed with two layers of fat. It is then rolled and folded in three a further twice or folded in four once. This produces the layering which is characteristic of croissant dough.\nThe white-poppy-seed filling, to which almond flavouring is added, clearly distinguishes the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 from other sweet pastries. White poppy seeds are a special and rarely used ingredient.\nThe following are essential to the product\u2019s exceptional nature:\n\u2014 the flaky croissant dough, containing the following ingredients: wheat flour, margarine, milk, eggs, sugar, yeast, salt, lemon flavouring.\n\u2014 the filling, made primarily from white poppy seeds, to which are added: sugar, sponge-cake crumbs, egg pulp, margarine, raisins, nuts, fruit in syrup or candied fruit (sweet cherries, pears, orange peel) and almond flavouring.\n\u2014 the method of folding the dough and filling it with a poppy-seed pulp and the icing and chopped-nut decoration influence the final unique shape and general appearance of the pastry.\nThe combination of these ingredients and the specific flaky pastry make the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 an exceptional and unique product.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe history, baking tradition and reputation of the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019\nThe \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 has enjoyed unwaning popularity and success in Pozna\u0144 for at least 150 years. In the minds of the citizens of Pozna\u0144 and visitors to this city on the river Warta, the product is associated with Saint Martin\u2019s Day celebrations on 11 November. The many legends and traditions relating to when the baking of this pastry began testify to the product\u2019s reputation.\nAccording to one of these legends, the first person to bake the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 in Pozna\u0144 was the confectioner J\u00f3zef Melzer, who encouraged his employer to bake croissants which were then distributed to the city\u2019s poor. He is said to have come up with the idea in November 1891 after having listened to the preachings of Fr Jan Lewicky, the priest of the parish of Saint Martin, who urged that the patron saint of the parish, who personifies love for one\u2019s neighbour, and is also the patron saint of bakers, be honoured by means of some act of compassion towards Pozna\u0144\u2019s poor.\nThe croissant shape also has traditional roots; its origin is attributed to the time of King Jan III Sobieski\u2019s victory over the Turks at the gates of Vienna. In 1683, King Jan III Sobieski of Poland seized many Turkish flags, on which a crescent moon was depicted; this shape has served as a model for baking the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019, in commemoration of this victory. According to another Pozna\u0144 legend, the shape alludes to the horseshoe lost by Saint Martin\u2019s horse.\nThe oldest known reference to croissants being baked on Saint Martin\u2019s Day was placed in the Gazeta Wielkiego Ksi\u0119stwa Pozna\u0144skiego [Gazette of the Grand Duchy of Poznan] of 10 November 1852 by the confectioner Antoni Pfitzner, who had opened his shop three years earlier on ul. Wroc\u0142awska in Pozna\u0144.\n\u2018Tomorrow, Thursday, filled croissants available at various prices at A. Pfitzner\u2019s confectioner\u2019s shop on ul. Wroc\u0142awska\u2019.\nThe first recorded use of the name \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 can be found in a press announcement from 11 November 1860.\nAfter the Second World War, the tradition of baking the \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 was continued by private confectioners and bakers in Pozna\u0144. The Nationalisation Act of 3 January 1946 did not cover small craft firms. The type of filling used in the pastry changed at that time. Given the difficulties affecting supplies, the ingredients to make an almond filling became virtually unavailable, and confectioners and bakers began to replace the almond filling with a white-poppy-seed filling.\nSince the 1960s newspapers have regularly reported the quantity of croissants eaten by the citizens of Pozna\u0144 on 11 November. Thanks to this source of information, it is known today that consumption grew from just over 10 tonnes in the early 1960s to some 42,5 tonnes in 1969. Nowadays, 250 tonnes of the product are sold on average on Saint Martin\u2019s Day by producers in Pozna\u0144, while annual sales are in the region of 500 tonnes.\nThe \u2018rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski\u2019 has become a symbol of Pozna\u0144 with which official guests are served. It was awarded a prize by the Polish Tourism Organisation in 2004, being described as follows:\n\u2018\u2026 a traditional pastry made using a unique recipe and baked only in Pozna\u0144 for Saint Martin\u2019s Day \u2026\u2019.This information demonstrates the reputation of this specific product and its association with Pozna\u0144 and the entire region.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttp://www.minrol.gov.pl/pol/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Zlozone-wnioski-o-rejestracje-Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/OGLOSZENIE-MINISTRA-ROLNICTWA-I-ROZWOJU-WSI-z-dnia-29-maja-2012-roku\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
