It aims at harmonising at worldwide level the emission test procedure used for the type-approval of motorcycles. Furthermore, it is adapted to the last development of technical progress taking into account the specific characteristics of motorcycles.\n(4) In accordance with Article 8(5) of Directive 2002/51/EC the test procedure of GTR No 2 should be introduced together with a new set of limit values. That test procedure should be introduced as an alternative type-approval procedure at the choice of the manufacturer for the second mandatory stage of Directive 2002/51/EC. The new limit values should be set in correlation with the second mandatory stage of Directive 2002/51/EC. Therefore, the stringency of the requirements on motorcycle emissions will not diminish.\n(5) Directive 97/24/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["Annex II of Chapter 5 to Directive 97/24/EC is amended in accordance with the text set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, before 1 July 2007, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
