Article 14 (4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be  reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.\n(3)  Since the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, due to a strong and growing demand for DRAMs,  in particular by computer manufacturers, prices of DRAMs, on a worldwide basis, have remained  stable. Lead times for deliveries of DRAMs have been considerable throughout this period.\nWith respect to the Community market in particular, the Commission has been able to follow  developments as almost all known Japanese and Korean DRAM producers supply the Commission on a  regular basis with their detailed sales reports pursuant to undertakings which the Commission has  accepted in the framework of both abovementioned anti-dumping proceedings  (5). An analysis of  these reports has confirmed that the market behaviour of the exporters concerned is in line with  the general evaluation of price developments made by market research companies, some of which  monitor the semiconductor market particularly closely.\n(4)  With regard to the situation of the Community DRAM-industry, the Commission has furthermore  received information confirming that this industry has also benefited from the current market  situation. Indeed, following the stabilization of the situation of the Community industry  concurrently with the introduction of the above anti-dumping measures and following the substantial  investments made for the production of the newest generations of DRAMs, the Community industry's  revenues stemming from an increase in DRAM sales volumes and in DRAM prices have had the effect  that the Community industry is no longer suffering financial losses on current sales, but rather  generating increased returns.\n(5)  The anti-dumping duties were imposed in order to underpin the undertakings and in order to  ensure that imports of any DRAMs outside the scope of the undertakings would not be made at an  injurious price level. The present market situation is one of strong demand, where market forces  are sustaining a level of prices for DRAMs which is at or above the prices at which the above  companies have undertaken to sell in the Community. It appears therefore that the absence of  injurious dumping of DRAMs on the Community market at present is not dependent on the maintenance  of the anti-dumping measures. Whilst the minimum prices applicable pursuant to the undertakings  have been overtaken by market prices, the continued existence of the ad valorem anti-dumping duties  constitutes an unnecessary barrier to entry to the Community market for DRAMs not covered by an  undertaking.\n(6)  However, based on previous experience gained in the DRAM market, it appears reasonable to  conclude that this development in prices may well be temporary. Indeed, the DRAM-market is a  cyclical market characterized by sharp up- and downturns in prices. The likelihood that current  market conditions are a temporary phenomenon leads to the conclusion that this situation should be  dealt with by a temporary suspension of the anti-dumping duties.\n(7)  In conclusion, the Commission considers that all requirements to suspend the anti-dumping  duties concerned pursuant to Article 14 (4) are met and that therefore these duties should be  suspended for a period of nine months. This conclusion has been reached on the basis of:\n-  reliable sales information collected in the course of the anti-dumping proceedings concerned,  reflecting market prices in the Community,\n-  the overall situation of the world DRAM market which, given the commodity nature of the product,  is inherently transparent, and -  experience of the cyclical nature of this industry.\n(8)  The Commission will continue to closely monitor the development of the DRAM-market and the  behavior of individual market participants. Should a situation arise in which a resumption of  injury to the Community industry occurs, the Commission will reinstate the above anti-dumping  measures without delay.\n(9)  To this end, the obligation to submit reports on sales and prices pursuant to the undertakings  will enable the Commission to monitor the DRAM market. However, the Commission considers that,  during the period of the suspension of the anti-dumping duties, the obligation to adhere to the  minimum price provisions of these undertakings should be discontinued. The quarterly calculation  and communication of such prices to these companies by the Commission will therefore be  discontinued during this period.\n(10)  In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 (4) of the basic Regulation the Commission  has informed the complainant of its intention to suspend the above anti-dumping measures and has  provided it with an opportunity to comment and its comments. These comments have been taken into  account reaching the present decision.\n(11)  The Advisory Committee was consulted on the suspension of the anti-dumping measures and  raised no objections,", "main_body": ["The definitive anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of certain  types of electronic microcircuits known as DRAMs (dynamic random access memories) originating in  Japan and the Republic of Korea by Regulations (EEC) No 2112/90 and (EEC) No 611/93 respectively  are hereby suspended for a period of nine months.\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal  of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 June 1995.\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President"}
