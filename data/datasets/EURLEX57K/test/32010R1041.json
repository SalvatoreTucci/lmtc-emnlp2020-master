As this information is an essential element for the management of the internal market, it is appropriate to change it into a weekly notification.\n(2) The objective of the provision in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 479/2010 is to relieve the Member States of the notification of export licence applications on days where no refunds or 0 refund rates are fixed for the products referred to in Part 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87\u00a0(3). It appears that the current drafting of the provision can lead to an incorrect interpretation. It is therefore appropriate to provide for a clearer formulation.\n(3) Regulation (EU) No 479/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 479/2010 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 6(1) point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) where appropriate, that no applications have been submitted on that day, except where none of the products referred to in Part 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87\u00a0(4) is subject to a refund or where only a 0 rate refund is applicable;\n2.
