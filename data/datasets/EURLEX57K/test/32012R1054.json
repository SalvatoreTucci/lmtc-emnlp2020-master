The weight of carcasses for tax purposes must be 100\u00a0kg or more, except for heifers of between 18 and 30 months, for which the weight is set at 85\u00a0kg.\nThe meat of \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 has a distinctive deep red colour; it is tender and lean.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nThe main feed must consist of pasture, except during the winter period, during which a feed supplement may be provided consisting solely of hay and cereals from the geographical area. Complete compound feeds, including medicated feedingstuffs, are not authorised under any circumstances.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe animals must be born, reared, slaughtered and cut in the geographical area.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nThe carcasses must be cut in the geographical area. The carcasses of animals slaughtered for the \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 PDO are smaller on average than those of slaughter cattle and therefore special know-how is needed to make the most of their small size. This know-how has been preserved solely in the geographical area, which is practically the only place on French territory where the two breeds used for the \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 PDO have been reared.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on labelling\n\u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 PDO meat is identified when the carcass is whole, at the stage between the weighing of the carcass for tax purposes and its emergence from the chilling room.\nA stamp identifying the PDO is then immediately applied to the different muscles (in eight spots). The stamp is issued by the Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9.\nUp to the final distribution stage, the carcass and pieces of meat cut from it are accompanied by an identification label displaying at least:\n\u2014 the designation;\n\u2014 the slaughter number;\n\u2014 the name of the farm written clearly;\n\u2014 the name and address of the cutting plant or slaughterhouse;\n\u2014 the European Union PDO logo.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nIn order to be entitled to the designation of origin, the meat must come from bull herds of the \u2018ra\u00e7o di Biou\u2019 breed or from livestock farms for the \u2018de Combat\u2019 breed located in the geographical area.\nThe animals must be born, reared, slaughtered and cut in the following geographical area:\nDepartment of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne:\n\u2014 Canton of Arles: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Ch\u00e2teaurenard: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Eygui\u00e8res: Aureilles, Eygui\u00e8res, Lamanon and Mouri\u00e8s.\n\u2014 Canton of Istres: Fos-sur-Mer, Istres.\n\u2014 Canton of Orgon: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh\u00f4ne: Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rh\u00f4ne.\n\u2014 Canton of Salon-de-Provence: Grans, Miramas, Salon-de-Provence.\n\u2014 Canton of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer: Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.\n\u2014 Canton of Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Tarascon-sur-Rh\u00f4ne: all the municipalities.\nDepartment of Gard:\n\u2014 Canton of Aigues-Mortes: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Aramon: all the municipalities, with the exception of the municipalities of Est\u00e9zargues and Domazan.\n\u2014 Canton of Beaucaire: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of L\u00e9dignan: Mauressargues.\n\u2014 Canton of Marguerittes: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of N\u00eemes: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Quissac: all the municipalities, with the exception of the municipality of Quissac.\n\u2014 Canton of Remoulins: Argilliers, Collias, Remoulins, Vers-Pont-du-Gard.\n\u2014 Canton of Rhony-Vidourle: all the municipalities.\nCanton of Saint-Chaptes: all the municipalities, with the exception of the municipalities of Aubussargues, Collorgues, Baron, Foissac, Saint-D\u00e9z\u00e9ry.\n\u2014 Canton of Saint-Gilles: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Saint-Mamert: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Sommi\u00e8res: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Uz\u00e8s: Arpaillargues-et-Aureillac, Blauzac, Sanilhac-Sagri\u00e8s, Saint-Maximin, Uz\u00e8s.\n\u2014 Canton of Vauvert: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Vistrenque (La): all the municipalities.\nDepartment of H\u00e9rault:\n\u2014 Canton of Castries: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Claret: Campagne, Fontan\u00e8s, Garrigues, Sauteyrargues, Vacqui\u00e8res.\n\u2014 Canton of Lunel: all the municipalities.\n\u2014 Canton of Matelles: Prades-le-Lez, Saint-Bauzille-de-Montmel, Sainte-Croix-de-Quintillargues, Saint-Vincent-de-Barbeyrargues.\n\u2014 Canton of Mauguio: all the municipalities.\nCanton of Montpellier: Castelnau-le-Lez, Clapiers, Le Cr\u00e8s, Lattes, Montpellier, P\u00e9rols.\nA wetland area has been marked out within this geographical area.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe geographical area of the PDO corresponds to the winter pasture area of \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019, that is, the municipalities in which the animals traditionally remain for the winter, in the vast stretches of scrubland and grassland. This area includes a wetland area that follows the borders of the Camargue and in which the animals remain for at least six months during the summer period.\nThese vast pastures composed of halophilous plants in the Camargue and of dry grasslands in the winter growth zone influence the physical and mental development of the animals. In turn, their rearing plays a significant environmental role, as it affects the evolution of the vegetation in the natural environments (sansou\u00efres, salt meadows, swamps and open lawns): the bulls limit the growth of certain plant species and use large areas of vegetation composed of a mosaic of juxtaposed and interconnected habitats.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nReference has been made in numerous works to the highly original nature of \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019, which stems partly from the isolation of the breed owing to the particular features of the Camargue and partly from a rearing method developed by breeders in order to adapt to the constraints of the environment.\nThese animals are nearly wild, non-domesticated, hardy and resistant. They are suspicious of humans and can therefore be aggressive.\nAs a result, the meat from these animals has particular characteristics as described in an INRA study (5 December 2007 \u2013 conference entitled \u2018Rencontres autour des Recherches sur les Ruminants\u2019), the main findings of which show that the muscles of these animals have a deep red colour and the meat is lean.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or another characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe particularity of \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 meat is closely linked to its environment and to the objective of the rearing, which is to produce bulls for sport. This requires nearly wild animals that have been reared in a preserved and safeguarded natural environment.\nThe excitable and aggressive nature of these animals means that they are perfectly suited to the purpose for which they are intended and gives the meat its characteristic features.\n\u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 is obtained from traditional local breeds, Camarguaise and Brave, and is particularly well adapted to the Camargue environment.\nReared unrestrained, the animals feed on pasture and remain in the wetland area for at least six months. The area has flat landscapes that are the result of a particular geology and pedology and are characterised by the presence of varying amounts of salt. These agronomically poor soils are home to specific ecosystems (salicornia, obione, glasswort).\nThe organoleptic qualities and particular nature of the meat can be explained by the diversity of the plant varieties found in the pastures:\n\u2014 halophilous plants (salicornia, glasswort, obione, etc.) in high-salt environments,\n\u2014 reeds and fescue in low-salt environments,\n\u2014 natural vegetation of the scrubland in the winter.\nThe deep red colour of the meat is caused by its pH, which is influenced by the alkaline nutrients of the halophilous plants. Its fine grain is characterised by muscle fibre that develops through the regular movement of the animal in the free-range pastures (pasture land). The voluntary and frequent movement of these animals means that their muscles \u2018feed\u2019 on fats, making their meat low-fat.\n\u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 has highly specific qualities linked to the combined action of the soil, environment and living conditions.\nShaped by its environment and bred according to the free-range method since ancient times, \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 has become an important partner in efforts to maintain biodiversity in the Camargue.\nReference to publication of the specification\nhttps://www.inao.gouv.fr/fichier/CDCTaureauDeCamargue.pdf"}
