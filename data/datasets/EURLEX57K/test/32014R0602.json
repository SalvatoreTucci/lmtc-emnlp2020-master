In order to facilitate the convergence of supervisory practices when applying additional risk weights, an appropriate formula should be defined. That formula should impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % which progressively increases with subsequent infringements of Articles 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. An appropriate factor should be introduced in the formula to allow for a lower additional risk weight to apply in the cases of exposures exempted pursuant to Article 405(3) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575/2013.\n(2) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.\n(3) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the\u00a0opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["General considerations\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competent authorities shall ensure that any additional risk weight imposed pursuant to Article 407 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is applied to all relevant securitisation positions, held by an institution, which are affected by the material infringement of Article 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an institution rectifies its infringement of the requirements provided in Article 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the additional risk weight shall cease to apply as soon as the rectification is notified to the competent authority.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When assessing whether to impose an additional risk weight, competent authorities shall consider both the materiality of the infringement of Article 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its relevance to the risk analysis of the securitisation position. Materiality shall be taken into consideration in both quantitative and qualitative terms and, where applicable, at both entity and consolidated level. In assessing materiality, competent authorities shall consider, among other factors, the duration of the infringement, the size of the affected positions and whether the institution has attempted to proactively rectify the infringement.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When assessing whether an institution has failed to meet the requirements set out in Article 405 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in any material respect by reason of negligence or omission, competent authorities shall not be influenced by any omission by the originator, sponsor or original lender to disclose its commitment to retain a material economic interest of not less than 5 % with regard to past securitisations, where the institution can demonstrate that it has taken appropriate account of such circumstance.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a material infringement of the disclosure requirement provided in Article 409 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575/2013 by reason of negligence or omission of the institution, competent authorities shall impose an additional risk weight to the originator's, sponsor's or original lender's retained positions in, or other exposure to the relevant securitisation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When assessing whether institutions have failed to meet the requirements set out in Articles 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in any material respect for reasons of negligence or of omission, for securitisation positions issued on or after 1 January 2011 and before 1 January 2014, competent authorities may take into account whether those institutions complied continuously between the date of issuance and 31 December 2013 with the requirements specified in Article 122a of Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) and in the Guidelines to Article 122a of Directive 2006/48/EC of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors\u00a0(4).", "Calculation of additional risk weight\nWhere an institution does not meet the relevant requirements provided in Articles 405, 406 or 409 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013in any material respect, competent authorities shall apply the following formula to determine the total risk weight (Total RW) in accordance with the approach specified in Article 245(6) and Article 337(3) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575/2013:\nTotal RW = Min[12,5; Original RW \u00d7 (1 + (2,5\u00a0+\u00a02,5 \u00d7 InfringementDurationyears) \u00d7 (1 \u2013 Article405ExemptionPct))]\nWhere:\n12,5 is a factor representing the maximum value that the total risk weight can reach;\n\u2018Original RW\u2019 is the risk weight that would apply to the securitisation positions if no additional risk weight was imposed;\n2,5 is the minimum factor applying to the original risk weight in order to calculate the additional risk weight;\n\u2018InfringementDurationyears\u2019 is the duration of the infringement, expressed in years, rounded down to the nearest 12-month period.
