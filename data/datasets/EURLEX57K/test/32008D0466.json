The present network of control posts does not meet the actual needs of transporters as control posts are missing in certain locations and a number of existing control posts are of poor quality standards despite official controls.\n(4) There is a need to determine, through stakeholders consultation and technical expertise, quality criteria for control posts as defined in the Community legislation and which strategies European wide should be developed to improve their use by transporters. A preparatory action including the building or renovating of high standard control posts in at least three Member States which have significant traffic flows of animals should be launched.\n(5) The European Parliament allocated EUR 1 million in the 2008 Community budget to launch a pilot project in order to develop improved animal production methods and to focus on alternatives to the castration of pigs and alternatives to the dehorning of cattle.\n(6) Concerning pig castration, this pilot project should complement ongoing research on castration and focus on its practical consequences by developing a programme establishing a European harmonised method to detect boar taint at the slaughter line under commercial conditions and to assess the commercial aspects of marketing meat from non-castrated animals. The development of such methods will encourage farmers to raise uncastrated animals and establish reliable and consistent data for further development of different alternatives to surgical castration (immunocastration, in particular). A second part of the study will look in depth into alternatives to the dehorning of cattle.\n(7) One project is foreseen to perform the preparatory action and one action for the pilot project. The financing of these actions should be subject to a single decision.\n(8) These actions are to form part of the further development of Community animal welfare legislation and will also support the actions identified in the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["The preparatory action referred to in the Annex are approved and shall be financed through the budget line 17\u00a004\u00a003\u00a003 of the budget of the European Communities for 2008 up to a maximum of EUR 4\u00a0000\u00a0000.", "The pilot project referred to in the Annex is approved and shall be financed through the budget line 17\u00a001\u00a004\u00a006 of the budget of the European Communities for 2008 up to a maximum of EUR 1\u00a0000\u00a0000."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1.
