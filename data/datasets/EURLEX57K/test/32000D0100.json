CAPOULAS SANTOS\n(1) Opinion delivered on 15 December 1999 (not yet published in the Official Journal).\nANNEX I\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES\nThe programme's aims are primarily:\n1. The safe and reliable operation of the high flux reactor (HFR) at Petten; this activity involves the normal use of the installation for more than 250 days a year, the management of the fuel cycle under the safety and quality controls.\n2. The rational use of this reactor will be developed in a broad range of disciplines; the major research and development themes involving the use of HFR are illustrated by the following examples: the study of materials, the support of R &  D work for the safety of the nuclear fuel cycle, the possibility to test nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes in order to eliminate plutonium resulting from nuclear disarmament, the development of medical isotopes to answer the questions of medical research, the testing of medical therapeutic techniques.\nANNEX II\nBREAKDOWN OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe contributions to this supplementary programme will come from the Netherlands, Germany and France.\nThe breakdown of these contributions is as follows:\n>TABLE>"}
