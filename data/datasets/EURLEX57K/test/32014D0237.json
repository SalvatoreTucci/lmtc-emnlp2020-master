The number of consignments from India intercepted with harmful organisms in the Union has shown an upward trend since 2010. Most of the interceptions concern plants other than seeds and roots of Colocasia Schott and plants other than seeds of Mangifera L., Momordica L., Solanum melongena L. and Trichosanthes L. (hereinafter \u2018the specified commodities\u2019).\n(2) Audits carried out by the Commission in India, in particular in 2010 and 2013, revealed shortcomings in the phytosanitary export certification system. Despite assurances and action taken by India, the number of interceptions increased further in 2013.\n(3) In the light of the outcome of those audits and the number of interceptions, it has been concluded that the current phytosanitary safeguards of India are insufficient to ensure that consignments are free from harmful organisms or to address the risk of introduction of harmful organisms into the Union through the import of the specified commodities.\n(4) Measures should be taken to address the risk posed by the import into the Union of the specified commodities originating in India. Consequently, the introduction into the Union of the specified commodities originating in India should be prohibited.\n(5) The measures should remain in place until 31 December 2015 in order to address the ongoing risk of introduction, while allowing India to upgrade its certification system.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The introduction into the territory of the Union of plants other than seeds and roots of Colocasia Schott and plants other than seeds of Mangifera L., Momordica L., Solanum melongena L. and Trichosanthes L., originating in India shall be prohibited.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1."}
