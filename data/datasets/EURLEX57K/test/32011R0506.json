Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health within the Union and therefore Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station\u00a0(2) was adopted on 25 March 2011.\n(3) On 12 May 2011, the Commission was informed of the finding of a high level of the radioactive caesium in green tea leaves, originating in the prefecture Kanagawa. This finding was confirmed on 13 May 2011 by three other findings of high level of the radioactive caesium in green tea leaves from this prefecture. This prefecture is not among the 12 prefectures of the affected zone, where a testing of all feed and food originating from these prefectures is required before export to the EU. Given these recent findings it is appropriate to add Kanagawa as 13th prefecture to the affected zone.\n(4) It is appropriate to clarify the requirements for products consigned from the affected zone but originating in a region outside the affected zone.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 is amended as follows\n(1) Article 2, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u2014 the product has been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011, or\n\u2014 the product is originating in and consigned from a prefecture other than Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba and Kanagawa, or\n\u2014 the product is consigned from the prefectures Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba and Kanagawa, but not originating in one of these prefectures and has not been exposed to radioactivity during transiting, or\n\u2014 in case the product is originating in the prefectures Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba and Kanagawa, the product does not contain levels of the radionuclides iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the maximum levels provided for in Annex II to this Regulation.
