It provides a trial for the introduction of a standardized animal-health management system for areas with a high livestock density.\nThe design selected for the computerized information system could serve as reference basis for the development of database systems for livestock records and movements.\nThe project is in line with the measure for the identification of livestock and the tracing of livestock movements with a view to monitoring animal health and helping to improve the animal-health status of holdings.\n1. Contents\nThe selected option involves two main measures:\n- keeping a register of pig farms,\n- identifying livestock movements.\nThe aim of the two measures is to control animal-health measures by means of real-time information on the health status of livestock and the management of animal movements.\nA. Keeping the farm register\nA common reference register is to be introduced. Each partner (veterinary services, laboratories, livestock services, producer groups and veterinarians) undertakes to help keep the register up to date by forwarding the information they have available by computer transmission. Rules on validation will be laid down. The information is input via a suitable mask (identification of stockfarm, geographical location, type of activity, animal-health information, etc.).\nAccess to the common register is subject to rules depending on the tasks and competence of each partner.\nThe computerized information system includes the link-up of sites (around 40) and a central computerized administration system.\nB. Identifying livestock movements\nUltimately the aim of the system is to identify all pig movements.\nIn the first stage, the emphasis will be on identifying piglet movements (from breeding establishments to fattening establishments).\nThe computerized system for the stockfarm register is also used for the identification of livestock movements. The input mask includes information relating to the farms of origin, the farms of destination and the details of transport with respect to each movement.\n2. Timetable\nA. First phase: From the date on which this Decision is notified to 1 May 1998\nThis phase will cover:\n- the finalization of software (application and communication),\n- the purchase and installation of computer equipment (server centres and network sites),\n- the purchase and installation of communication equipment (modems, etc.),\n- the development of the common reference register,\n- test on specific areas.\nB. Second phase: 1 May to 31 December 1998\nThis will be an operational phase covering:\n- verification of the proper functioning of the system,\n- the rectifying of any shortcomings;\n- an assessment of the technical aspects and the system's contribution to the animal-health management of pig farms.\nANNEX II\nFORECAST COSTS\nAll tasks will be subject to a call for tenders in accordance with the regulations in force.\n>TABLE>"}
