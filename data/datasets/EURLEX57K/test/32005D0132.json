By Decision 2000/137/EC\u00a0(3), the Commission accepted undertakings offered by exporters originating in Croatia and Ukraine. By Decision 2002/669/EC, the Commission accepted the voluntary withdrawal of the joint undertaking of the Ukrainian producers.\n(2) Further to a request lodged by the Defence Committee of the Seamless Steel Tube Industry of the European Union, the Commission initiated an interim review of the anti-dumping measures in force, including the form of the measure, in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation\u00a0(4).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF AN UNDERTAKING\n(3) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 258/2005\u00a0(5), concluded the review.\n(4) As set out in recital (137) of Regulation (EC) No 258/2005, and after having consulted all interested parties concerned, the undertaking in its current form is not appropriate anymore. On this basis, and also in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking in question, which authorises the Commission to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking unilaterally, the Commission has concluded to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking.\n(5) The Commission informed the Croatian company Mechel \u017deljezara Ltd. in December 2004 that it proposed to withdraw the acceptance of the current undertaking. Subsequent to the disclosure, the Croatian government informed the Commission that the company, being the sole producer of the product concerned in Croatia, has been liquidated and ceased production in autumn 2004. Therefore, in addition, the undertaking is considered as being no longer valid.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF DECISION 2000/137/EC\n(6) In view of the above, Commission Decision 2000/137/EC, as amended by Commission Decision 2002/669/EC, should be repealed.\n(7) In parallel to this Decision, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 258/2005 has imposed a definitive country-wide anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Croatia,", "main_body": ["Commission Decision 2000/137/EC, as amended by Commission Decision 2002/669/EC, is hereby repealed.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 February 2005.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
