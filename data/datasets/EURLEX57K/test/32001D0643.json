These undertakings concerned only one pallet type, i.e. the EUR pallet.\n(2) Since sampling was used in the investigation, requests for reviews under Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 could not be accepted. However, in order to ensure equal treatment between new exporters and the cooperating companies not included in the sample during the original investigation, the provisional Regulation was amended. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 stipulated that new Polish exporting producers could have undertakings accepted with regard to exports of EUR pallets, provided they satisfied the criteria set out therein.\n(3) By Regulation (EC) No 2334/97(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1521/2000(7), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland.\nB. NEW EXPORTERS' REQUEST\n(4) Following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2334/97, the following five further new Polish exporting producers have requested that Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 is applied to them and they offered undertakings with regard to the EUR pallets:\n- P.P.D.B. \"Lesnik\" S.C., Krosno,\n- \"Europal\" S.C., Brzeziny,\n- P.P.U.H. \"Centropal\" Eksport-Import, Czajkow,\n- Energomontaz Polnoc Serwis Sp.zo.o., Swierze Gorne,\n- P.P.H. \"BOM'S\" S-ka zo.o., Suwalki.\nThey have also provided sufficient evidence pursuant to the aforementioned Article of this regulation showing that they are genuine new exporting producers. In application of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97, the undertakings offered by these five Polish exporting producers with regard to the EUR pallet should therefore be accepted.\nC.
