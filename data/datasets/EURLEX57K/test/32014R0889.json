Article 14k(2)(b) and\u00a0(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93\u00a0(3) provides that if the applicant for Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status is already a regulated agent the criterion on \u2018appropriate security and safety standards\u2019 shall be deemed to be met in relation to the premises for which the economic operator obtained the status of regulated agent. Points 6.3.1.2 and 6.4.1.2 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010\u00a0(4) provide that the appropriate authority, or independent validator acting on its behalf, should take into account whether or not the applicant for regulated agent or known consignor is a holder of an AEO certificate.\n(3) The practical implementation of both the customs legislation governing the AEO status and the aviation legislation governing the regulated agent and known consignor has shown that the existing recognition between the programmes is not sufficient to ensure the highest possible synergies between the respective security programmes. The security requirements for both the aviation security regulated agent and known consignor programme and for the customs AEO programme are equivalent to such an extent that both programmes may be aligned further.\n(4) Further alignment of both programmes in terms of equal level of recognition, including required exchange of information is necessary in order to decrease the administrative burden for the economic sector concerned and government authorities (both customs and civil aviation) while strengthening further the current level of security.\n(5) Amendment of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is necessary to update the references to the aviation legislation in force, include the recognition of the known consignor status with its relevance for the AEO as well, frame the scope of recognition of the common requirements between the respective programmes and allow for the necessary exchange of information between customs and aviation authorities.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 14k is amended as follows:\n(a) point (b) of paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) be a regulated agent as defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) (\u201cregulated agent\u201d) and fulfil the requirements laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010\u00a0(6);\n(b) in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added:\n(c) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n(2) In Article 14w the following paragraph 4 is added:\n(a) the AEO certificate \u2014 security and safety (AEOS) and AEO certificate \u2014 customs simplifications/security and safety (AEOF) including the name of the holder of the certificate and, where applicable, their amendment or revocation or the suspension of the status of authorised economic operator and the reasons therefor;\n(b) information about whether the specific site concerned has been visited by customs authorities, the date of the last visit and the purpose for the visit (authorisation process, reassessment, monitoring);\n(c) any reassessments of AEOS and AEOF certificates and the results thereof.\n(3) In Article 14x the following paragraph 2a is inserted:\n(4) Annex 1C is amended as follows:\n(a) the title of box 15 is replaced by the following:\n(b) the title of the explanatory notes to box 15 is replaced by the following:\n\u201815.\n(c) the explanatory notes to box 15 are replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0302, 19.10.1992, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 (OJ L\u00a097, 9.4.2008, p.\u00a072).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ L\u00a0253, 11.10.1993, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 of 4 March 2010 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security (OJ L\u00a055, 5.3.2010, p.\u00a01)."}
