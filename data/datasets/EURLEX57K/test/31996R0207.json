whereas management measures should be established for the import of these animals;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of cows and heifers of various mountain breeds; whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals with third countries; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 15 animals should be required to have been exported or imported between 1 July 1994 and 30 June 1995 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State;\nWhereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers, therefore, the reference quantities to be taken into account as giving access to the quantities reserved for traditional importers should be those imports from countries which are for them third countries on 31 December 1994 carried out between 1 July 1994 and 31 December 1994 as well as imports between 1 January 1995 and 30 June 1995 as part of the quota covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 1800/94 of 18 July 1994 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine and mountain breeds (3);\nWhereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1996;\nWhereas the management of the system should be ensured through import licences; whereas, to that end, it would be appropriate to define, in particular, the detailed rules for submission of applications, as well as the information which must be included on the applications and licences, if necessary by derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (5), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2856/95 (7); whereas provision should also be made for the licences to be issued after a delay for consideration and, where necessary, with the application of a single percentage reduction;\nWhereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community customs code (8), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, provides for customs supervision of goods put into free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their end-use; whereas imported animals should be monitored for a certain period to ensure that they are not slaughtered; whereas, in order to ensure that the animals concerned are not slaughtered, a security should be required;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.

For the purposes of Article 2 (1) (b), importers may submit applications for rights to import until 7 February 1996 together with the proof referred to in Article 2 (4).\nAfter verification of the documents presented, Member States shall forward to the Commission, by 16 February 1996 at the latest, the list of applicants and the quantities requested.\n5. All notifications, including notifications of nil applications, shall be made by telex or fax, drawn up on the basis of the models in Annexes IV and V where applications have been made.", "1. The Commission shall decide to what extent applications may be accepted.\n2. As regards the applications referred to in Article 4 (4), if the quantities in respect of which applications are made exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall reduce the quantities applied for by a fixed percentage.\nIf the reduction referred to in the preceding subparagraph results in a quantity of less than 15 head per application, the allocation shall be by drawing lots, by batches of 15 head, by the Member States concerned. If the remaining quantity is less than 15 head, a single licence shall be issued for that quantity.", "1. Imports of quantities allocated shall be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2. Import licence applications may only be submitted to the competent authority of the Member State in which the applicant is entered in a national VAT register.\n3. After the notification of allocations from the Commission, import licences shall be issued as soon as possible on application by and in the names of the operators who have obtained rights to import. The issue of licences shall be subject to the lodging by the applicant of a security of ECU 25 per head of cattle.\nThe security shall be released immediately licences are returned to the issuing authority bearing an endorsement by the customs authorities certifying import of the animals.\n4.
