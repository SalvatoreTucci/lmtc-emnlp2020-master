As in the framework of the first-come, first-served management method of that quota there are no longer import licences with validity limited to 30 June of each importing year, it is therefore opportune to drop the validity limit of 30 June for the certificates of authenticity. Instead, a period of three months from the date of issue of those certificates should be established which is in line with other high-quality beef tariff quotas.\n(2) For reasons of clarity, it is necessary to indicate, in the requirements for goods to benefit from the preferential tariff quota concerned, as set out in Annex II to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 481/2012, the bovine animals covered by the Union carcass classification and thus eligible for producing \u2018high quality beef\u2019.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 481/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) For reasons of legal certainty, the new period of validity of certificates of authenticity should not apply to certificates of authenticity issued before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 481/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 3, paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Annex II, footnote 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(1) For the purposes of these requirements, heifers and steers are \u201cbovine animals\u201d, as defined in point 1 of Part IV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, which correspond, respectively, to categories E and C, as defined in Part A of Annex V to that Regulation.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to certificates of authenticity issued from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 8.6.2012, p. 9.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 182, 15.7.2009, p. 1."}
