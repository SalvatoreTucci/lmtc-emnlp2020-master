Implementing rules should be laid down for the 2000/01 quota year starting on 1 July 2000.\n(2) The arrangements for administering the quota should be comparable to those used in the past for corresponding quotas. These arrangements should entail the Commission's allocating part of the quantities available to traditional traders and part to traders involved in trade in beef and veal.\n(3) Traditional importers should be allocated 80 % of the quota, i.e. 42400 tonnes, in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota during the most recent reference period. In certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict traders' access to this part of the quota. Steps shoud be taken to make good any resulting damage.\n(4) Traders who can show that they are genuinely involved in trade of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota, i.e. 10600 tonnes, in accordance with a procedure whereby the parties concerned submit applications to be accepted by the Commission. Proof of genuine involvement in trade calls for evidence to be presented of trade of some significance in beef and veal with third countries.\n(5) In 1999 Belgian beef and veal exports were severely affected by discussion of dioxin. As far as the figure of 10600 tonnes is concerned, Belgium's situation as regards exports should be taken into account when the criteria relating to results are determined.\n(6) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is entered in a national VAT register.\n(7) Traders no longer involved in trade in beef and veal at 1 April 2000 should be denied access to the quota in order to prevent speculation. The issue of import licences to traders should likewise be limited to the import rights allocated to them.\n(8) Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1127/1999(4), and (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2648/98(6), are applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation.\n(9) Effective management of the quota and fraud prevention in particular require used licences to be returned to the competent authorities so they can check that the quantities shown therein are correct. The competent authorities must accordingly be under an obligation to carry out such checks. The security to be lodged when licences are issued should be fixed at a level that ensures licences are actually used and returned to the competent authorities.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1. A tariff quota totalling 53000 tonnes expressed in weight of boneless meat is hereby opened for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.\nThe serial number of the tariff quota shall be 09.4003.\nFor the purpose of the said quota, 100 kilograms of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 77 kilograms of boneless meat.\n2.

For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the 10600 tonnes shall be allocated to traders who can furnish proof that they have:\n- imported at least 160 tonnes of beef in the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2000 other than quantities imported under Regulations (EC) No 1042/97, (EC) No 1142/98 and (EC) No 995/1999, or\n- exported at least 300 tonnes of beef in the same period.\nFor this purpose, \"beef\" means products covered by CN codes 0201, 0202 and 0206 29 91, and the minimum reference quantities shall be expressed in terms of product weight.\nNotwithstanding the second indent, the period of export for established traders entered in the VAT register in Belgium since 1 April 1997 shall run from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1999.\n3.

Together with the proof referred to in Article 2(4), applications for import rights shall be submitted before 29 May 2000 to the competent authority in the Member State where the applicant is entered in the national VAT register. Where an applicant submits more than one application under either of the arrangements referred to in Article 2(1)(a) or (b), all such applications shall be inadmissible.\nApplications pursuant to Article 2(1)(b) shall not cover more than 50 tonnes of frozen boneless meat overall.\n2. After the documents submitted have been verified, the Member States shall forward the following to the Commission before 12 June 2000:\n- in respect of the arrangements under Article 2(1)(a), a list of eligible importers, including in particular their names and addresses and the quantities of eligible meat imported during the reference period concerned,\n- in respect of the arrangements under to Article 2(1)(b), a list of applicants, including in particular their names and addresses and the quantities applied for.\n3.
