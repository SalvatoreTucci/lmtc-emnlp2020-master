SANTER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 100, 21. 4. 1975, p. 1.\nANNEX B. 3\nANNEX CONCERNING REIMPORTATION IN THE SAME STATE\nINTRODUCTION\nGoods are often reimported into the country whence they were exported in the same state as they were before exportation. In many cases, this reimportation was foreseeable at the time of exportation, in which case the goods may have been exported with notification of intended return. However, in certain cases, goods are reimported owing to circumstances which arise after their exportation.\nThe national legislation of most States includes provisions enabling such reimported goods to enter free of import duties and taxes and provides for the repayment of any export duties and taxes paid on exportation. The customs procedure which provides for such duty-free importation and repayment is that of reimportation in the same state. This procedure is granted subject to the condition that the identity of the goods can be established. Any sums chargeable as a result of repayment or remission of or conditional relief from duties and taxes or of any subsidies or other amounts granted at exportation, must be paid.\nThis Annex does not apply to the reimportation of travellers' personal effects or of means of transport for private use.\nDEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n(a) the term \u2018reimportation in the same state\u2019 means the customs procedure under which goods which were exported and were in free circulation or were compensating products may be taken into home use free of import daties and taxes, provided that they have not undergone any manufacturing, processing or repairs, abroad. Any sums chargeable as a result of repayment or remission of or conditional relief from duties and taxes or of any subsidies or other amounts granted at exportation, must be paid;\n(b) the term \u2018clearance for home use\u2019 means the customs procedure which provides that imported goods may remain permanently in the customs territory. This procedure implies the payment of any import duties and taxes chargeable and the accomplishment of all the necessary customs formalities;\n(c) the term \u2018import duties and taxes\u2019 means the customs duties and all other duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are collected on or in connection with the importation of goods, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered;\n(d) the term \u2018export duties and taxes\u2019 means customs duties and all other duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are collected on or in connection with the exportation of goods, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered;\n(e) the term \u2018goods exported with notification of intended return\u2019 means goods specified by the declarant as intended for reimportation, in respect of which identification measures may be taken by the customs to facilitate reimportation in the same state;\n(f) the term \u2018goods in free circulation\u2019 means goods which may be disposed of without customs restriction;\n(g) the term \u2018compensating products\u2019 means the products obtained during or as a result of the manufacturing, processing or repair of the goods temporarily admitted for inward processing;\n(h) the term \u2018goods declaration\u2019 means a statement made in the form prescribed by the customs, by which the persons interested indicate the customs procedure to be applied to the goods and furnish the particulars which the customs require to be declared for the application of that procedure;\n(ij) the term \u2018person\u2019 means both natural and legal persons, unless the context otherwise requires.\nPRINCIPLES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nReimportation in the same state shall be governed by the provisions of this Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nNational legislation shall

the exported goods is reimported.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nWhen circumstances so justify, reimportation in the same state should be allowed even if the goods are reimported by a person other than the person who exported them.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nReimportation in the same state shall not be refused on the grounds that the goods have been used or damaged, or have

operations.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nReimportation in the same state shall not be limited to goods imported directly from abroad but shall also be authorized for goods which are under another

REIMPORTATION IN THE SAME STATE\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nWhere time limits are fixed in national legislation beyond which reimportation in the same state will not be granted, such

than one year.\nREPAYMENT OF EXPORT DUTIES AND TAXES\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nAny export duties and taxes paid should be repaid as soon as possible after the goods have been

In certain countries the declaration for exportation with notification of intended return is the only document required for reimportation in the same state.\n2. The identity of the goods may be established by the customs authorities on the basis of the identification measures taken on exportation.\nGOODS EXPORTED WITH NOTIFICATION OF INTENDED RETURN\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goods to be exported with notification of intended return\n19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nThe customs authorities should, at the request of the declarant, allow goods to be exported with notification of intended return, and should take any necessary steps to facilitate reimportation in the same state.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Customs offices competent for exportation with notification of intended return\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nCustoms offices at which goods may be exported outright shall also be competent to authorize exportation with notification of intended return.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goods declaration for exportation with notification of intended return\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nThe goods declaration forms used for exporting goods with notification of intended return should be harmonized with those used for outright exportation.\nNote:\nExportation with notification of intended return may also be authorized under cover of an ATA carnet in lieu of a national customs document.\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Documentation to be presented in support of the declaration for exportation with notification of intended return\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nIn support of the declaration for exportation with notification of intended return the. customs authorities shall require only those documents considered necessary by them to permit control of the operation and to ensure compliance with all requirements relating to the application of relevant restrictions or other regulations.\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Identification of goods exported with notification of intended return\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nWhen determining the nature of the identification measures to be taken with respect to goods exported with notification of intended return, the customs authorities shall take account in particular of the nature of the goods and the revenue interests involved.\nNote:\nFor the identification of goods to be exported with notification of intended return, the customs authorities may affix customs marks (seals, stamps, perforations, etc.), or rely on marks, numbers or other indications permanently affixed to the goods or on the description of the goods, scale plans or photographs, or take samples.\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Facilities granted to goods exported with notification of intended return\n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recommended practice\nGoods exported with notification of intended return should be granted conditional relief from any export duties and taxes applicable.\nNote:\nThe declarant may be required to provide security for recovery of the sums that would be chargeable if the goods were not reimported within any time limit specified.\n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nAt the request of the person concerned, the customs authorities shall allow exportation with notification of intended return to be converted to definitive exportation, subject to compliance with the relevant conditions and formalities.\nNotes:\n1.
