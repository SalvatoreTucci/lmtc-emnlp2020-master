Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by use of the method termed \u2018Zwei-Punkte-Messverfahren (ZP)\u2019.\n2. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nPART 2\nFat-O-Meater (FOM)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Fat-O-Meater (FOM)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of six millimetres diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950/960 type and having an operating distance of between 3 and 103 millimetres. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nPART 3\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade on top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO) and photodetector of the type 58 MR and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nPART 4\nULTRA-FOM 300\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Ultra-FOM 300\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 3,5 MHz. The ultrasonic signal is digitised, stored and processed by a microprocessor.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:"}
