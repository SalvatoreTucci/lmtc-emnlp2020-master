Exemptions for critical uses are intended to be limited derogations to allow a short period of time for the adoption of alternatives.\n(2) Decision IX/6 states that methyl bromide should qualify as \u2018critical\u2019 only if the applicant determines that the lack of availability of methyl bromide for that specific use would result in a significant market disruption; and that there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes available to the user that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health and are suitable to the crops and circumstances of the nomination. Furthermore, the production and consumption, if any, of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if all technically and economically feasible steps have been taken to minimise the critical use and any associated emission of methyl bromide. An applicant should also demonstrate that an appropriate effort is being made to evaluate, commercialise and secure national regulatory approval of alternatives and substitutes; and that research programmes are in place to develop and deploy alternatives and substitutes.\n(3) The Commission received 84 proposals for critical uses of methyl bromide from 10 Member States including Belgium (60\u00a0825 kg), France (467\u00a0135 kg), Germany (45\u00a0250 kg), Greece (227\u00a0280 kg), Italy (2\u00a0298\u00a0225 kg), Poland (44\u00a0100 kg), Portugal (130\u00a0000 kg), Spain (1\u00a0059\u00a0000 kg), the Netherlands (120 kg) and the United Kingdom (140\u00a0408 kg). A total of 4\u00a0472\u00a0343 kg was requested, comprising 4\u00a0111\u00a0640 kg (92\u00a0%) for pre-harvest uses and 360\u00a0703 kg (8\u00a0%) for post-harvest uses of methyl bromide.\n(4) The Commission applied the criteria contained within Decision IX/6 and Article 3(2)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 in order to determine the amount of methyl bromide that is eligible to be licensed for critical uses in 2005. The Commission found that adequate alternatives were available in the Community and had become more prevalent in many Parties to the Montreal Protocol in the period since the critical use proposals were compiled by Member States. As a result, the Commission determined that 2\u00a0777\u00a0333 kg of methyl bromide can be used in 2005 to satisfy critical uses in each of these Member States. This amount equates to 14,4\u00a0% of 1991 consumption of methyl bromide in the European Community and indicates that more than 85\u00a0% of the methyl bromide has been replaced by alternatives. The critical-use categories are similar to those defined in Annex II Table A of the reports of the First Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol\u00a0(2), and in Table 1A of Decision XVI/2 at the Sixteenth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol\u00a0(3).\n(5) Article 3(2)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 requires the Commission to also determine which users may take advantage of the critical use exemption. As Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 requires Member States to define the minimum qualification requirements for personnel involved in the application of methyl bromide, and as fumigation is the only use, the Commission determined that methyl bromide fumigators are the only users proposed by the Member State and authorised by the Commission to use methyl bromide for critical uses. Fumigators are qualified to apply it safely, rather than for example farmers or mill owners that are generally not qualified to apply methyl bromide but who own properties on which it will be applied.\n(6) Decision IX/6 states that production and consumption of methyl bromide for critical uses should be permitted only if methyl bromide is not available from existing stocks of banked or recycled methyl bromide. Article 3(2)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 states that production and importation of methyl bromide shall be allowed only if no recycled or reclaimed methyl bromide is available from any of the Parties. In accordance with Decision IX/6 and Article 3(2)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000, the Commission determined that 205\u00a0926 kg of stocks are available for critical uses. The European Commission has put in place licensing procedures to ensure stocks are used before methyl bromide is authorised for importation or production.\n(7) As critical uses of methyl bromide apply from 1 January 2005, and for the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may benefit from the licensing system, it is appropriate that this present decision shall apply from that date.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of The Netherlands, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall be permitted to use a total of 2\u00a0777\u00a0333 kg of methyl bromide for critical uses from 1 January to 31 December 2005 for the specific quantities and categories of use described in Annexes I to X.", "Stocks declared available for critical uses by the competent authority of each Member State shall be deducted from the amount that can be imported or produced to satisfy critical uses in that Member State.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2005 and shall expire on 31 December 2005."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 244, 29.9.2000, p. 1.
