Seasonally adjusted job vacancy data facilitate the interpretation of quarterly changes.\n(7) Data provided on job vacancies should be relevant and complete, accurate and comprehensive, timely, coherent, comparable, and readily accessible to users.\n(8) The benefits of collecting complete data at Community level on all segments of the economy should be balanced against the reporting possibilities of, and the response burden on, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.\n(9) Particular efforts should be made to include in the statistics as soon as possible all data concerning units with fewer than 10 employees.\n(10) To determine the scope of the statistics to be compiled and the level of detail required by economic activity, it is necessary to apply the version of the statistical classification system for economic activities in the Community (NACE) that is currently in force.\n(11) In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(7) on 24\u00a0February 2005 and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.\n(12) It is important that the data be shared with the social partners at national and Community level and that the social partners be informed concerning the implementation of this Regulation. Furthermore, Member States should make a particular effort to ensure that school career guidance services and vocational training bodies receive the data.\n(13) Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0322/97 of 17\u00a0February 1997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(8) provides a general legislative framework for the production of Community statistics and applies, therefore, to the production of job vacancy statistics.\n(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(9).\n(15) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to define certain concepts; determine certain reference dates, formats and deadlines; set out the framework for feasibility studies, and adopt measures pursuant to the results of those studies. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(16) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the production of Community job vacancy statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(17) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article\u00a03 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down the requirements for the regular quarterly production of statistics on Community job vacancies.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall submit to the Commission (Eurostat) data on job vacancies at least for business units with one employee or more.\nSubject to paragraph\u00a03, the data shall cover all economic activities defined by the common classification system for economic activities in the Community (NACE) in force, except for the activities of households as employers and the activities of extraterritorial organisations and bodies.
