However, as a result of negotiations which led to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the United States of America pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994\u00a0(2), approved by Council Decision 2006/333/EC\u00a0(3), the Community undertook to incorporate in its schedule for all Member States an adjustment of 24\u00a0070 head for that import quota.\n(2) Detailed rules for the administration of these quotas are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 558/2007 of 23 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening\u00a0(4), for periods from 1 July of each year to 30 June of the following year.\n(3) The use of the first-come, first-served principle has proved positive in other agricultural sectors, and in the interest of administrative simplification, the import quota for young male bovine animals for fattening should henceforth be administered in accordance with the method indicated in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993, laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5).\n(4) Due to the particularities of the transfer from one administrative system to the other, the quota to which this Regulation refers should be regarded as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(5) Article 166 of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code\u00a0(6) (Modernised Custom Code) provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their specific use. Animals imported under the tariff quota provided for in this Regulation should be supervised for a sufficient period to ensure that they are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units.\n(6) A security should be lodged to ensure compliance with this fattening requirement. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the Common Customs Tariff duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 558/2007 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An import tariff quota for 24\u00a0070 young male bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102\u00a090\u00a005, 0102\u00a090\u00a029 or 0102\u00a090\u00a049 and intended for fattening in the Community is hereby opened every year for periods from 1 July to 30 June of the following year (import quota periods).\nThis tariff quota shall have the order number 09.0113.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quota referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be administered in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
