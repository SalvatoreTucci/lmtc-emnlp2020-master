Those documents have been published as the \u2018Communication of the Commission with regard to the interpretative documents of Directive 89/106/EEC\u00a0(2)\u2019.\n(2) With respect of the essential requirement of safety in the event of fire, interpretative document No 2 lists a number of interrelated measures which together define the fire safety strategy to be variously developed in the Member States.\n(3) Interpretative document No 2 identifies one of those measures as the limitation of the generation and spread of fire and smoke within a given area by limiting the potential of construction products to contribute to the full development of a fire.\n(4) The level of that limitation may be expressed only in terms of the different levels of reaction-to-fire performance of the products in their end-use application.\n(5) By way of a harmonised solution, a system of classes was adopted in Commission Decision 2000/147/EC of 8 February 2000 implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards the classification of the reaction to fire performance of construction products\u00a0(3).\n(6) In the case of fibrous gypsum plaster casts it is necessary to use the classification established in Decision 2000/147/EC.\n(7) The reaction-to-fire performance of many construction products and/or materials, within the classification provided for in Decision 2000/147/EC, is well established and sufficiently well known to fire regulators in Member States that they do not require testing for this particular performance characteristic,", "main_body": ["The construction products and/or materials which satisfy all the requirements of the performance characteristic \u2018reaction-to-fire\u2019 without need for further testing are set out in the Annex.", "The specific classes to be applied to different construction products and/or materials, within the reaction-to-fire classification adopted in Decision 2000/147/EC, are set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "Products shall be considered in relation to their end-use application, where relevant.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 62, 28.2.1994, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 50, 23.2.2000, p. 14.\nANNEX\nThe table set out in this Annex lists construction products and/or materials which satisfy all of the requirements for the performance characteristic reaction-to-fire without need for testing.\nTable\nClasses of reaction-to-fire performance for fibrous gypsum plaster casts reinforced with sisal fibres or jute fibres\nProduct Product detail Minimum density Class\u00a0(1)\nFibrous gypsum plaster casts Product according to EN 13815, made by casting gypsum plaster mixed with water, reinforced by uniformly dispersed sisal or jute fibres at the rate of no more than 2,5\u00a0% by mass. 1\u00a0000 A1\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Class as provided for in Table 1 of the Annex to Decision 2000/147/EC."}
