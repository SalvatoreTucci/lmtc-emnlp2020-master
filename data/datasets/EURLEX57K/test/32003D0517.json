The weighting of the national central banks in the key for subscription of the ECB's capital needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n(4) It is necessary to lay down rules for the provision of the statistical data to be used for the adjustments of the weighting of the national central banks in the key for subscription of the ECB's capital.\n(5) The nature of, and sources for, the data to be used and the method of calculation of the weighting of the national central banks in the key for subscription of the ECB's capital should be defined.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96/EC of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(5) provides for a methodology on common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules intended to be used for compiling accounts and tables on comparable bases for the purpose of the Community and provides for a programme for transmitting for Community purposes the accounts and tables compiled according to that Regulation on precise dates. That Regulation takes account of the most recent standards and developments in statistical methodology and the definitions therein should therefore be used for the purposes of this Decision.\n(7) Since the key for the ECB capital subscription determines the respective shares of the national central banks in the capital of the ECB and in the pooling of external reserves, as well as their voting weights in the ECB Governing Council for all decisions to be taken by weighted votes (in accordance with Article 10.3 of the Statute) and the distribution among them of the monetary income of the ESCB, it is important that the calculation of their weighting in this key is carried out in an accurate manner. The Commission should therefore consult the relevant committees on the data on population and on gross domestic product at current market prices,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe statistical data to be used for the adjustment of the weighting of the national central banks in the key for subscription of the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) shall be provided by the Commission in accordance with the rules laid down in this Decision.", "Population\n1. \"Population\" shall mean the total population as defined in Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 compiled as an average of the year and rounded to the nearest thousand people.\n2.
