Those limits, together with the sampling and analytical methods, were established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs\u00a0(3).\n(3) A recent Community inspection in Brazil has revealed serious hygiene shortcomings in the handling of fishery products. As a result of those shortcomings the fish is not as fresh as it should be and spoils quickly and there may be high levels of histamine in certain fish species (in particular those belonging to the families: Scombridae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Coryfenidae, Pomatomidae and Scombresosidae). The inspections have also revealed a limited capacity of the Brazilian authorities to carry out the necessary checks of fish, in particular to detect histamine in those species.\n(4) Excessive levels of histamine in fishery products constitute a serious risk for human health.\n(5) It is appropriate to adopt at Community level measures applicable to imports of fishery products which might be contaminated to ensure effective and uniform protection in all the Member States.\n(6) Imports into the Community of fishery products from fish species associated with a high amount of histidine, should be authorised only if it can be shown that they have been subjected to a systematic check at origin to verify that their histamine levels do not exceed the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005.\n(7) However, it is appropriate to temporarily authorise, the import of consignments that are not accompanied by the results of checks at origin, provided that Member States ensure that those consignments undergo appropriate checks on arrival at the Community border to verify that their histamine levels do not exceed the limits set by Regulation (EC) No\u00a02073/2005. This temporary authorisation should be limited to the time that would allow the Brazilian authorities to build their own check capacity.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 sets up the rapid alert system for food and feed, which should be used to implement the mutual information requirement provided for in Article 22(2) of Council Directive 97/78/EC\u00a0(4). In addition the Member States should keep the Commission informed through periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of fishery products from Brazil.\n(9) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by Brazil and on the basis of the results of the tests carried out by Member States.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Decision shall apply to fishery products of fish belonging to the families Scombridae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Coryfenidae, Pomatomidae and Scombresosidae, imported from Brazil and intended for human consumption.", "Analytical tests for histamine\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall authorise the import into the Community of products referred to in Article 1 only if they are accompanied by the results of an analytical test for histamine carried out in Brazil before consignment which reveals histamine levels below the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005.
