The increase in the quota provided for in paragraph 1 shall be calculated on the basis of a quota which consists of 4 038 authorizations, the number of authorizations allocated to each Member State being as follows:\nBelgium: 434\nDenmark: 305\nGermany: 727\nGreece: 88\nFrance: 656\nIreland: 88\nItaly: 567\nLuxembourg: 111\nNetherlands: 626\nUnited Kingdom: 436\n3. The Community authorizations resulting from the increase in the quota shall be allocated among the Member States on the basis of 50 % allocated across the board and 50 % on the basis of the use made of the Community quota authorizations by carriers established in each Member State.\nThe method of calculating the utilization of Community authorizations is given in Annex IV.\nIn order to take into account their special geographical situation, the number of authorizations allocated to Greece, Ireland and the United Kingdom shall be increased by 6,6 and 2 units respectively for 1985 and by 3,3 and 1 units for each of the subsequent four years.\n4.

After consulting the Member States, the Commission shall fix, before 1 October of each year as from 1985, and in accordance with the criteria set out above, the allocation to Member States of the extra authorizations resulting from the increase in the quota.\nThe Member States shall be notified of the Commission's decision; it shall become enforceable two months after its notification unless the matter has been referred to the Council by a Member State in the meanwhile. In that case, the Council shall take a decision by a qualified majority before 31 December of the same year.\nThe decisions of the Commission and of the Council shall remain in force until any new decisions on the adjustment and allocation of the Community quota are adopted.\n6.
