That Regulation acknowledges that, in the case of the outermost regions, adjustments and derogations may be envisaged to meet the specific needs of those regions.\n(2) Article 299(2) of the Treaty recognises, moreover, the constraints affecting the outermost regions, which include the French overseas departments.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91(5) seeks to remedy the handicaps due to the remote and insular nature of these departments and to improve the conditions under which their agricultural products are produced and marketed.\n(4) The structures of certain agricultural holdings or processing and marketing enterprises located in the French overseas departments show serious shortcomings and are beset with specific difficulties. Provision should accordingly be made for derogations for certain types of investments from the provisions limiting or preventing the grant of some structural aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.\n(5) Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 restricts the grant of forestry support to forests and wooded areas belonging to private owners and municipalities and associations thereof. The great majority of forests and wooded areas located in these departments belong to public authorities other than municipalities. Under these circumstances, the conditions laid down in the said Article should be made more flexible.\n(6) The Community financial contribution for three of the accompanying measures referred to in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 may amount in the outermost regions to up to 85 % of the total eligible cost. On the other hand, in accordance with the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47(2) of that Regulation, the Community financial contribution for agri-environmental measures, which constitutes the fourth accompanying measure, shall be limited to 75 % for all areas covered by Objective 1. In view of the importance attributed to agri-environment within the context of rural development, the rate of the Community financial contribution should be harmonised for all accompanying measures in the outermost regions.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(6) each plan, Community support framework, operational programme and single programming document shall cover a period of seven years, and the programming period shall begin on 1 January 2000. In the interests of cohesiveness and to avoid discrimination between beneficiaries of the same programme, the derogations provided for in this Regulation must, exceptionally, be applicable to the whole programming period,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 is hereby amended as follows:\nThe following Article 21 shall be inserted in Title VI: \"Article 21\n1.
