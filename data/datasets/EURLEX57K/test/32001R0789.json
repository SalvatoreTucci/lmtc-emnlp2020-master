It is necessary that the provisions of this manual be adopted and regularly amended and updated in order to meet the operational requirements of the relevant consular authorities.\n(4) Furthermore, a manual concerning the issuance of Schengen visas in third States where all the Schengen States are not represented has been established as Document SCH/II (95) 16, 19th revision, listed under reference SCH/Com-ex (99) 13 in Annex A to Decision 1999/435/EC. It is also necessary that the provisions of this manual be adopted and regularly amended and updated.\n(5) Finally, pursuant to Council Decision 2000/645/EC of 17 October 2000 correcting the Schengen acquis as contained in Schengen Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex (94) 15 rev.(4), document SCH/II-Vision (99) 5 (hereinafter referred to as \"Schengen Consultation Network (Technical Specifications)\") which, inter alia, lays down the principles pursuant to which the computerised procedure for consultation, for the purposes of issuing visas, of the central authorities referred to in Article 17(2) of the Convention must be applied is attached to Schengen Executive Committee decision SCH/Com-ex (94) 15 rev. It is also necessary that the provisions of the Schengen Consultation Network (Technical Specifications) be adopted and regularly amended and updated.\n(6) Various provisions of Title II, Chapter 3, of the Convention, and in particular Article 17 thereof, and of the CCI, provide for implementing decisions to be taken by the Executive Committee, established by the Schengen agreements adopted before 1 May 1999, for which the Council has substituted itself, pursuant to Article 2 of the Protocol. Pursuant to Article 1 of the Protocol, cooperation in the context of the Schengen acquis is to be conducted within the institutional and legal framework of the European Union and with respect for the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union and of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to set out in a Community act the procedure by which such implementing decisions should be taken.\n(8) Since the Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of visa policy, reflecting the sensitivity of this area, in particular involving political relations with third countries, the Council reserves the right, during the transitional period of five years referred to in Article 67(1) of the Treaty, to adopt, amend and update the detailed provisions and practical procedures referred to above by unanimity, pending a review by the Council of the conditions under which such implementing powers would be conferred on the Commission after the end of that transitional period.\n(9) Some of those provisions and procedures require confidential treatment in order to prevent risk of abuse.\n(10) It is also necessary to provide for a procedure whereby the members of the Council and the Commission are informed without delay of all amendments to the manual of documents to which a visa may be affixed, to the manual concerning the issuance of Schengen visas in third States where all the Schengen States are not represented, to Annexes 6 and 9 of the Schengen Consultation Network (Technical Specifications), and to those Annexes to the CCI which consist, in whole or in part, of lists of factual information which must be provided by each Member State in accordance with the rules which it currently applies, and which therefore do not fall to be adopted, amended or updated by an act of the Council.\n(11) Those elements of the CCI and the Annexes thereto which are not subject to amendment by either of the procedures provided for in this Regulation should be amended in accordance with the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular points 2 and 3 of Article 62 and Article 67 thereof.\n(12) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this instrument, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given the fact that this instrument is an act which aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 5 of the abovementioned Protocol applies,", "main_body": ["1.
