SCHOMERUS\n(1) OJ L 307, 13.12.1993, p. 18.\n(2) OJ C 368, 23.12.1994, p. 6.\nANNEX\nEUROPEAN AGREEMENT\non the organisation of working time of seafarers\nHaving regard to the Agreement on social policy annexed to the Protocol on social policy attached to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Articles 3(4) and 4(2) thereof;\nWhereas Article 4(2) of the Agreement on social policy provides that agreements concluded at European level may be implemented at the joint request of the signatory parties by a Council Decision on a proposal from the Commission;\nWhereas the signatory parties hereby make such a request,\nTHE SIGNATORY PARTIES HAVE AGREED THE FOLLOWING:\nClause 1\n1. The Agreement applies to seafarers on board every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, which is registered in the territory of any Member State and is ordinarily engaged in commercial maritime operations. For the purpose of this Agreement a ship that is on the register of two States is deemed to be registered in the territory of the State whose flag it flies.\n2. In the event of doubt as to whether or not any ships are to be regarded as seagoing ships or engaged in commercial maritime operations for the purpose of the Agreement, the question shall be determined by the competent authority of the Member State. The organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned should be consulted.\nClause 2\nFor the purpose of the Agreement:\n(a) the term \"hours of work\" means time during which a seafarer is required to do work on account of the ship;\n(b) the term \"hours of rest\" means time outside hours of work; this term does not include short breaks;\n(c) the term \"seafarer\" means any person who is employed or engaged in any capacity on board a seagoing ship to which the Agreement applies;\n(d) the term \"shipowner\" means the owner of the ship or any other organisation or person, such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner and who on assuming such responsibility has agreed to take over all the attendant duties and responsibilities.\nClause 3\nWithin the limits set out in Clause 5, there shall be fixed either a maximum number of hours of work which shall not be exceeded in a given period of time, or a minimum number or hours of rest which shall be provided in a given period of time.\nClause 4\nWithout prejudice to Clause 5, the normal working hours' standard of seafarer is, in principle, based on an eight-hour day with one day of rest per week and rest on public holidays. Member States may have procedures to authorise or register a collective agreement which determines seafarers' normal working hours on a basis on less favourable than this standard.\nClause 5\n1. The limits on hours of work or rest shall be either:\n(a) maximum hours of work which shall not exceed\n(i) fourteen hours in any 24 hour period; and\n(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period;\nor\n(b) minimum hours of rest which shall not be less than:\n(i) ten hours in any 24 hour period; and\n(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period.\n2. Hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours in length and the interval between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.\n3. Musters, fire-fighting and lifeboat drills, and prescribed by national laws and regulations and by international instruments shall be conducted in a manner that minimises the disturbance of rest periods and does not induce fatigue.\n4. In respect of situations when a seafarer is on call, such as when a machinery space is unattended, the seafarer shall have an adequate compensatory rest period if the normal period of rest is disturbed by call-outs to work.\n5. With regard to paragraphs 3 and 4, where no collective agreement or arbitration award exists or if the competent authority determines that the provisions in the agreement or award are inadequate, it would be for the competent authority to determine such provisions to ensure that the seafarers concerned have sufficient rest.\n6. With due regard for the general principles of the protection of the health and safety of workers, Member States may have national laws, regulations or a procedure for the competent authority to authorise or register collective agreements permitting exceptions to the limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. Such exceptions shall, as far as possible, follow the standards set out but may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods, or the granting of compensatory leave for watchkeeping seafarers or seafarers working on board ship on short voyages.\n7. A table shall be posted, in an easily accessible place, with the shipboard working arrangements, which shall contain for every position at least:\n(a) the schedule of service at sea and service in port; and\n(b) the maximum hours of work or the minimum hours of rest required by the laws, regulations or collective agreements in force in the Member States.\n8. The table referred to in paragraph 7 shall be established in a standardised format in the working language or languages of the ship and in English.\nClause 6\nNo seafarer under 18 years of age shall work at night. For the purpose of this Clause, \"night\" means a period of at least nine consecutive hours, including the interval from midnight to five a.m. This provision need not be applied when the effective training of young seafarers between the ages of 16 and 18 in accordance with established programmes and schedules would be impaired.\nClause 7\n1. The master of a ship shall have the right to require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate dafety of the ship, persons on board or cargo, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other ships or persons in distress at sea.\n2. In accordance with paragraph 1, the master may suspend the schedule of hours of work or hours of rest and require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored.\n3. As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored, the master shall ensure that any seafarer who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.\nClause 8\n1. Records of seafarers' daily hours of work or of their daily hours of rest shall be maintained to allow monitoring of compliance with the provisions set out in Clause 5. The seafarer shall receive a copy of the records pertaining to him or her which shall be endorsed by the master, or a person authorised by the master, and by the seafarer.\n2. Procedures shall be determined for keeping such records on board, including the intervals at which the information shall be recorded. The format of the records of the seafarers' hours of work or of their hours of rest shall be established taking into account any available international guidelines. The format shall be established in the language provided by Clause 5, paragraph 8.\n3. A copy of the relevant provisions of the national legislation pertaining to this Agreement and the relevant collective agreements shall be kept on board and be easily accessible to the crew.\nClause 9\nThe records referred to in Clause 8 shall be examined and endorsed at appropriate intervals, to monitor compliance with the provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest that give effect to this Agreement.\nClause 10\n1. When determining, approving or revising manning levels, it is necessary to take into account the need to avoid or minimise, as fas as practicable, excessive hours of work, to ensure sufficient rest and to limit fatigue.\n2. If the records or other evidence indicate infringement of provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest, measures, including if necessary the revision of the manning of the ship, shall be taken so as to avoid future infringements.\n3. All ships to which this Agreement applies shall be sufficiently, safely and efficiently manned, in accordance with the minimum safe manning document or an equivalent issued by the competent authority.\nClause 11\nNo person under 16 years of age shall work on a ship.\nClause 12\nThe shipowner shall provide the master with the necessary resources for the purpose of compliance with obligations under this Agreement, including those relating to the appropriate manning of the ship. The master shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the requirements on seafarers' hours of work and rest arising from this Agreement are complied with.\nClause 13\n1. All seafarers shall possess a certificate attesting to their fitness for the work or which they are to be employed at sea.\nThe nature of the health assessment to be made and the particulars to be included in the medical certifcate shall be established after consultation with the shipowners and seafarers organisations concerned.\nAll seafarers shall have regular health assessments. Watchkeepers suffering from health problems certified by a medical practitioner as being due to the fact that they perform night work shall be transferred, wherever possible, to day work to which they are suited.\n2. The health assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be free and comply with medical confidentiality. Such health assessments may be conducted within the national health system.\nClause 14\nShipowners shall provide information on watchkeepers and other night workers to the national competent authority if they so request.\nClause 15\nSeafarers shall have safety and health protection appropriate to the nature of their work. Equivalent protection and prevention services or facilities with regard to the safety and health of seafarers working by day or by night shall be available.\nClause 16\nEvery seafarer shall be entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks, or a proportion thereof for periods of employment of less than one year, in accordance with the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and or/practice.\nThe minimum period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is terminated.\nBrussels, 30 Septembre 1998.\nFederation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union (FST)\nEuropean Community Shipowners' Association (ECSA)"}
