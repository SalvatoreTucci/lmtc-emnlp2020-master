These transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT own resources base.\n(2) Romania has requested authorisation from the Commission to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base since it is unable to make the precise calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point (10) of Part B of Annex X to Directive 2006/112/EC. Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Romania\u2019s total VAT own resources base. Romania is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions. Romania should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resource base using approximate estimates in accordance with the second indent of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89.\n(3) For reasons of transparency and legal certainty it is appropriate to limit the applicability of the authorisation in time,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base from 1 January 2011, Romania is authorised to use approximate estimates in respect of the following category of transactions referred to in part B of Annex X to Directive 2006/112/EC:\nTransport of passengers (point (10)).", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to Romania."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJanusz LEWANDOWSKI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 7.6.1989, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 10, 15.1.2010, p. 14."}
