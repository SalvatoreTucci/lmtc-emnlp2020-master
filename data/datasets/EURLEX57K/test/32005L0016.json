It also provides for certain zones to be designed as protection zones.\n(2) Due to a clerical error in the 2003 Act of Accession, the list of counties in Sweden recognised as a protected zone in respect of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say was incorrect and needs to be rectified.\n(3) From information supplied by Denmark, that Member State should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus as it appears that that harmful organism is now established in Denmark.\n(4) From information supplied by the United Kingdom, it appears that Dendroctonus micans Kugelan is now established in some parts of the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the protected zone in respect of Dendroctonus micans Kugelan should be restricted to Northern Ireland. In addition, the protected zone in respect of that organism should also be restricted to the Isle of Man and Jersey.\n(5) From information supplied by Estonia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is not present in that Member State. Estonia may therefore be recognised as a protected zone for that organism.\n(6) From information supplied by Italy and from additional information collected by the Food and Veterinary Office during a mission in Italy in May 2004, it appears that Citrus tristeza virus is now established in that Member State. Italy should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Citrus tristeza virus.\n(7) From the Swiss legislation on plant protection, it appears that the Canton of Ticino is no longer recognised as a protected zone for Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. in Switzerland. The rules on imports to the Community should be adjusted to remove special treatment given to plants originating in Ticino.\n(8) Due to a clerical error in the preparation of Commission Directive 2004/31/EC\u00a0(2), the special requirements for the introduction and movement of Vitis plants in Cyprus as laid down in point 21.1 of Part B of Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC were erroneously deleted. Accordingly, that Annex should be amended.\n(9) In order to enhance the phytosanitary protection of the Community seeds of Medicago sativa L. and the Community certified seeds of Helianthus annuus L., Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.) Karsten ex Farw. and Phaseolus L., those seeds need to be accompanied by a plant passport when moving, other than locally, within the Community.\n(10) The relevant Annexes to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II, III, IV and V to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 14 May 2005 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
