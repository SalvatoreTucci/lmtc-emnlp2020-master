The Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, shall undertake work to fulfil the aims set out in Article 1 on the comparability of vocational training qualifications between the various Member States, in respect of specific occupations or groups of occupations.\n2. The work may use as a reference the structure of training levels drawn up by the Commission with the help of the Advisory Committee for Vocational Training.\nThe text of the said structure is attached to this Decision for information purposes.\n3. The work referred to in paragraph 2 shall first and foremost concentrate on the occupational qualifications of skilled workers in mutually agreed occupations or groups of occupations.\n4. The scope of this Decision may subsequently be extended to permit work to be undertaken, on a proposal from the Commission, at other levels of training.\n5. The SEDOC register, used in connection with the European system for the international clearing of vacancies and applications for employment, shall, whenever possible, be used as the common frame of reference for vocational classifications.", "The following working procedure shall be employed by the Commission in establishing the comparability of vocational training qualifications in close cooperation with the Member States and the organizations of workers and employers at Community level:\n- selection of the relevant occupations or groups of occupations on a proposal from the Member States or the competent employer or worker organizations at Community level;\n- drawing up mutually agreed Community job descriptions for the occupations or groups of occupations referred to in the first indent;\n- matching the vocational training qualifications recognized in the various Member States with the job descriptions referred to in the second indent;\n- establishing tables incorporating information on:\n(a) the SEDOC and national classification codes;\n(b) the level of vocational training;\n(c) for each Member State, the vocational title and corresponding vocational training qualifications;\n(d) the organizations and institutions responsible for dispensing vocational training;\n(e) the authorities and organizations competent to issue or to validate diplomas, certificates, or other documents certifying that vocational training has been acquired;\n- publication of the mutually agreed Community job descriptions and the comparative tables in the Official Journal of the European Communities;\n- establishment, within the meaning of Article 4 (3), of a standard information sheet for each occupation or group of occupations, to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;\n- dissemination of information on the established comparabilities to all appropriate bodies at national, regional and local levels, as well as throughout the occupational sectors concerned.\nThis action could be supported by the creation of a Community-wide data base, if experience shows the need for such a base.", "1. Each Member State shall designate a coordination body, based wherever possible on existing structures, which shall be responsible for ensuring - in close collaboration with the social partners and the occupational sectors concerned - the proper dissemination of information to all interested bodies. The Member States shall also designate the body responsible for contacts with the coordination bodies in other Member States and with the Commission. 2. The coordination bodies of the Member States shall be competent to establish appropriate arrangements with regard to vocational training information for their competent national, regional or local bodies as well as for their own nationals wishing to work in other Member States and for workers who are nationals of other Member States, on established cases of comparable vocational qualifications.\n3. The bodies referred to in paragraph 2 may supply on request in all Member States an information sheet drawn up in accordance with the model provided for in the sixth indent of Article 3, which the worker may present to the employer together with his national certificate.\n4. The Commission is to continue studying the introduction of the European vocational training pass advocated by the Committee for a People's Europe in paragraph 21 of its report of 29 and 30 March 1985.\n5. The Commission shall give the bodies referred to in paragraph 2, on request, all necessary assistance and advice concerning the preparation and setting up of the arrangements provided for in paragraph 2, including the adaptation and checking of the relevant technical documents.", "The Commission shall, in close liaison with the national coordination bodies designated by the Member States,\n- review and update at appropriate, regular intervals, in close cooperation with the Member States and the organizations of workers and employers at Community level, the mutually agreed Community job descriptions and the comparative tables relating to the comparability of vocational training qualifications,\n- where necessary, formulate proposals for a more efficient operation of the system including other measures likely to improve the situation as regards the comparability of vocational qualification certificates,\n- where necessary, assist in the case of technical difficulties encountered by the national authorities or specialized bodies concerned.", "Each Member State shall submit to the Commission, for the first time two years after adoption of this Decision, and therefore every four years, a national report on the implementation of this Decision and the results obtained.\nThe Commission shall, at appropriate intervals, submit a report on its own work and on the application of this Decision in the Member States.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States and the Commission."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 July 1985.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.

The volume of theoretical knowledge and practical capabilities involved is very limited.\nThis form of training must primarily enable the holder to perform relatively simple work and may be fairly quickly acquired.\nLEVEL 2\nTraining providing access to this level: compulsory education and vocational training (including, in particular, apprenticeships)\nThis level corresponds to a level where the holder is fully qualified to engage in a specific activity, with the capacity to use the instruments and techniques relating thereto.\nThis activity involves chiefly the performance of work which may be independent within the limits of the relevant techniques.\nLEVEL 3\nTraining providing access to this level: compulsory education and/or vocational training and additional technical training or technical educational training or other secondary-level training\nThis form of training involves a greater fund of theoretical knowledge than level 2. Activity involves chiefly technical work which can be performed independently and/or entail executive and coordination duties.\nLEVEL 4\nTraining providing access to this level: secondary training (general or vocational) and post-secondary technical training\nThis form of training involves high-level technical training acquired at or outside educational establishments. The resultant qualification covers a higher level of knowledge and of capabilities. It does not generally require mastery of the scientific bases of the various areas concerned. Such capabilities and knowledge make it possible in a generally autonomous or in an independent way to assume design and/or management and/or administrative responsibilities.\nLEVEL 5\nTraining providing access to this level: secondary training (general or vocational) and complete higher training\nThis form of training generally leads to an autonomously pursued vocational activity - as an employee or as self-employed person - entailing a mastery of the scientific bases of the occupation. The qualifications required for engaging in a vocational activity may be integrated at these various levels."}
