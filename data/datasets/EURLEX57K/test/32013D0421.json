These modifications concern Article 6 and the introduction of a new Part III in Annex 9 to the TIR Convention, establishing the conditions and requirements to be complied with by an international organisation which is authorised to take on the responsibility for the effective organisation and functioning of an international guarantee system and to print and distribute TIR Carnets.\n(4) The proposed amendments to the TIR Convention introduce a definition of the international organisation and clearly define its authorisation process. The introduction of a new Part III in Annex 9 would complement the purpose of that Annex by defining clearly the roles and responsibilities of all actors in the TIR system and would increase the transparency of its management. The introduction of these conditions and requirements in the legal text of the TIR Convention would also simplify the text of the written agreement between UNECE and the international organisation in accordance with Explanatory Note 0.6.2 bis 2 to Article 6 paragraph 2 of the TIR Convention.\n(5) Delegates of all Member States expressed their positive opinion as regards the amendment proposal within the Customs Legislation Committee (Coordination Geneva).\n(6) In its 53rd session in February 2012, the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention adopted the proposed amendments to the TIR Convention, subject to the completion of the internal procedures of the Union.\n(7) On 5 July 2012, the Administrative Committee transmitted to the Secretary-General, in accordance with the Article 59(1) and (2) of the TIR Convention, proposals for amendments to Article 6.2 bis and Annex 9 to the text of the TIR Convention, adopted at its 53rd session held in Geneva on 9 February 2012. On 10 July 2012, the Secretary-General issued the Depository Notification C.N.358.2012.TREATIES, communicating that if, by 10 July 2013, none of the Contracting Parties had notified any objections to the amendment proposals, they would enter into force on 10 October 2013.\n(8) The position to be adopted on behalf of the Union concerning the proposed amendments should therefore be determined,", "main_body": ["The position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Administrative Committee for the TIR Convention shall be based on the draft Annex by the Administrative Committee attached to this Decision.\nThe amendments to the Convention shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union indicating their date of entry into force.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
