That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544) as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, turkeys and minor avian species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544) has been authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1444/2006\u00a0(2) and for weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EU) No 333/2010\u00a0(3).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of the preparation for chickens reared for laying, turkeys and minor avian species. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 5 October 2010\u00a0(4) that Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544), under the proposed conditions of use, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the weight gain of the target species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 271, 30.9.2006, p. 19.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 102, 23.4.2010, p. 19.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(10):1867.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
