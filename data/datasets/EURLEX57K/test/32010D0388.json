In 2005, the Community and Ukraine agreed on a European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan identifying medium-term priorities in EU-Ukraine relations. That Action Plan was replaced by the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda of November 2009. Since 2007, the Community and Ukraine have been negotiating an Association Agreement that is expected to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The framework of EU-Ukraine relations is further enhanced by the newly launched Eastern Partnership.\n(2) The Ukrainian economy has been increasingly affected by the international financial crisis, with dramatically declining output, a deteriorating fiscal position and rising external financing needs.\n(3) Ukraine\u2019s economic stabilisation and recovery is supported by financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Ukraine was approved in November 2008.\n(4) Following a further deterioration of Ukraine\u2019s fiscal position, a large part of the second tranche under the IMF\u2019s SBA and the full amount of the third tranche were channelled to Ukraine\u2019s State budget.\n(5) Ukraine has requested Union macrofinancial assistance in view of the deteriorating economic situation and outlook.\n(6) Given that a residual financing gap in 2009-2010 remains in Ukraine\u2019s balance of payments, macrofinancial assistance is considered an appropriate response to Ukraine\u2019s request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the current IMF programme. This macrofinancial assistance is also expected to contribute to alleviating the external financing needs of the State budget.\n(7) Union macrofinancial assistance can only contribute to economic stabilisation if the main political forces in Ukraine ensure political stability and establish a broad consensus on a rigorous implementation of the necessary structural reforms.\n(8) Union macrofinancial assistance should be provided to Ukraine in addition to the loan facility granted under Council Decision 2002/639/EC of 12 July 2002 providing supplementary macrofinancial assistance to Ukraine\u00a0(2).\n(9) The Union macrofinancial assistance should not merely supplement programmes and resources from the IMF and the World Bank, but should ensure the added value of Union involvement.\n(10) The Commission should ensure that the Union macrofinancial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies.\n(11) The specific objectives of the Union macrofinancial assistance should strengthen efficiency, transparency and accountability. These objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission.\n(12) The conditions underlying the provision of the Union macrofinancial assistance should reflect the key principles and objectives of the Union\u2019s policy towards Ukraine.\n(13) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests linked to this macrofinancial assistance, it is necessary that Ukraine adopt appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance. It is also necessary that the Commission provide for appropriate controls and that the Court of Auditors provides for appropriate audits.\n(14) The release of the Union macrofinancial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.\n(15) This macrofinancial assistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents.\n(16) According to Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for the control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers shall be laid down in advance by a regulation adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
