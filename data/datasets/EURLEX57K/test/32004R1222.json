This consistency should be maintained in the event that the Council amends Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 or the Commission introduces new references to the European system of accounts (ESA 95) set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Community\u00a0(7) into Regulation (EC) No 3605/93.\n(5) Regulations (EC) No 264/2000, No 1221/2002 and No 501/2004 state that quarterly data on non-financial and financial accounts of general government are to be transmitted three months after the end of the quarter to which they refer.
