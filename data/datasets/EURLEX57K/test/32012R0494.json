It is necessary to ensure a balance between overall expenditure incurred by the Agency in carrying out certification tasks and overall income from the fees it levies.\n(4) The geographical location of the undertakings in the territories of the Member States should not be a discriminatory factor when setting fees.\n(5) The applicant should have the choice to request a financial quote of the foreseeable amount to be paid for the service which will be provided. The criteria for determining the amount to be paid should be clear, uniform and public. Where it is not possible to accurately determine this amount in advance, transparent principles for assessing the amount to be paid during the provision of the service should be established by the Agency.\n(6) Deadlines for the payment of fees and charges levied under this Regulation should be fixed. Appropriate remedies in cases of non-payment should be laid down such as the termination of the related application processes, invalidation of related approvals, ceasing of any further provision of services to the same applicant, and recovery of the outstanding amount through available means.\n(7) Charges for appeals against decisions of the Agency should be paid in full before the appeal is declared admissible.\n(8) Interested parties should be consulted prior to any modification of fees. Moreover, the Agency should regularly provide interested parties with information on how and on what basis the fees are calculated to provide interested parties with an insight into the costs incurred by the Agency, and to provide the industry with the appropriate financial visibility and the ability to anticipate the cost of the fees it will be required to pay. It should therefore be possible to review the levels of fees annually on the basis of the Agency\u2019s financial results and forecasts.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 65 of the Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 2 points (a) to (d) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) \u201cfees\u201d means the amounts levied by the Agency and payable by applicants for certification tasks;\n(b) \u201ccharges\u201d means the amounts levied by the Agency and payable by applicants for services other than certification tasks provided by the Agency, including the supply of goods;\n(c) \u201ccertification tasks\u201d means all activities carried out by the Agency directly or indirectly for the purposes of issuing, maintaining or amending certificates pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and its implementing rules;\n(d) \u201capplicant\u201d means any natural or legal person requesting to benefit from a certification task or a service provided by the Agency;\u2019;\n3. in Article 4, the following second and third paragraphs are added:\n4.
