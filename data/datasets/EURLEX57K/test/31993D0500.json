whereas wide-ranging international cooperation is therefore desirable in order to obtain significant results;\nWhereas, since the Treaty does not provide for other powers to cover the energy aspects of the programme referred to in Article 2, Article 235 should also be invoked;\nWhereas the Council resolution of 16 September 1986 concerning new Community energy policy objectives for 1995 and convergence of the policies of the Member States (4) states that the contribution of new and renewable energy sources to the replacement  of traditional fuels should increase substantially, so that those energy sources can play a significant part in the overall energy balance sheet;\nWhereas some renewable energy sources today occupy only a few market slots; whereas, if they are not yet competitive, this is to be explained in part by the fact that the present pricing system does not always take into account fully the ecological cost  of the principal traditional sources of energy; whereas, in order to strengthen the future contribution of renewable energy sources to energy supplies, the Member States will have to avoid such distortions;\nWhereas, by its recommendation of 9 June 1988 on developing the exploitation of renewable energy sources in the Community (5), the Council confirmed in detail its desire to pursue a policy of developing renewable energy sources;\nWhereas, when reviewing the progress made towards achieving the energy objectives for 1995 provided for in its resolution of 16 September 1986, the Council stated in its conclusions of 8 November 1988 that it attributed particular importance to  renewable energy sources for future energy supplies;\nWhereas the development of renewable energy sources and in particular the exploitation of biomass offer secondary economic advantages in terms of employment and keeping local populations in situ;\nWhereas the promotion and wider use of renewable energy sources throughout the Community are likely to strengthen its economic and social cohesion, as called for by Article 130a of the Treaty;\nWhereas, to this end, it is appropriate to take account of the Community's indicative objectives and make provision for resources to further the attainment of those objectives, taking into consideration the particular conditions in each Member State;\nWhereas provision should be made for a five-year programme;\nWhereas ECU 40 million is the amount estimated as necessary in order to implement the multiannual programme; whereas this amount is intended to fund the programme for the period 1993 to 1997 provided it is consistent with the Community's medium-term  financial perspective in force as from 1 January 1993,", "main_body": ["Member States shall endeavour to contribute in their energy policies to the limitation of carbon dioxide emissions by taking account of the Community's indicative objectives relating to the renewable energy sources which are set out in Annex  I.", "1.
