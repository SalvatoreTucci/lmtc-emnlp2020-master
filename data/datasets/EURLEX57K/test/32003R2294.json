This makes it necessary for the Commission to define in a very precise way which varieties should qualify for the reduction.\n(3) Basmati rice imported into the EU from India and Pakistan should comply with specific requirements in order to maintain the high quality of the product and limit the imported quantities to Basmati pure line varieties.\n(4) Checks should be reinforced to counter the risk of fraud linked to the origin of the rice as well as to the varieties imported.\n(5) It is also necessary to specify which Basmati rice varieties should be considered to be eligible for the reduction, after consultation of and examination of the matter with Indian and Pakistani authorities.\n(6) In view of the high level of demand for Basmati Rice from India and Pakistan and of the experience in the management of the regime, controls should be laid down to guarantee the quality of the imported product. In that respect Member States may establish appropriate monitoring programmes which may include the use of DNA analysis.\n(7) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1503/96 is amended as follows:\n1.
