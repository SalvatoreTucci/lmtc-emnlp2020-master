Of this total the budgetary authority agreed on 21 and 22 November 2001 at the conciliation meeting between the Council and a delegation of the European Parliament, with the participation of the Commission, to enter EUR 27 million in the 2003 budget.\n(2) The actions for the conversion of Spanish and Portuguese fleets fall under heading 2 \"structural measures\", sub-heading \"Structural Funds\" of the financial perspectives.\n(3) In accordance with point 12, paragraph 2 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, the appropriations foreseen for actions covered by heading 2 \"structural measures\" of the financial perspectives do not leave any margin under the ceiling.\n(4) At the conciliation meeting on 25 November 2002, the European Parliament and the Council have accepted transfer No 51/2002 which provides EUR 14991760 from unused appropriations in the 2002 budget onto the line B2-2 0 0.
