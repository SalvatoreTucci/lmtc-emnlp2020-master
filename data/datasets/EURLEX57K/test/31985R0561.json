Quantities shall be charged against the ceilings as and when products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation, accompanied by a movement certificate.\nProducts may be charged against a ceiling only if the movement certificate is submitted before the date on which customs duties are reintroduced.\nThe extent to which a ceiling is used up shall be determined at Community level on the basis of the imports charged against it, as defined in the preceding subparagraphs.\nMember States shall inform the Commission, at the intervals and within the time limits specified in paragraph 4, of imports effected in accordance with the above procedures.\n3. As soon as a ceiling has been reached, the Commission shall adopt a Regulation reintroducing, until the end of its period of validity, the customs duties applicable to third countries.\nIn the case of such a reintroduction, Greece introduces the levying of the duties which it applies to third countries at the date in question.\n4.
