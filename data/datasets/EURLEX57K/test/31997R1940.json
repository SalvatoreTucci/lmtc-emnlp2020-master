whereas, consequently, rights to import have already been allocated out of the total number of animals available with a view to their importation in 1997; whereas, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95, that number must be fully counted against the number of animals specified, for 1997, in the Annexes to the said Regulation; whereas the quota set out in the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 should consequently be adjusted and the detailed rules relating to those quantities should be laid down;\nWhereas experience has shown that limiting imports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the planned measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be allocated to 'traditional` importers of cows and heifers of specified mountain breeds; whereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this product group into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available to traders who are able to show that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and in order to ensure efficient management, the trader concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head in 1996; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable; whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the same Member State;\nWhereas, for purposes of checking that these criteria are met, applications should be submitted in the Member State where the importer is listed in the VAT register;\nWhereas in order to prevent speculation, traders no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 July 1997 should be denied access to the quota;\nWhereas provision should be made for the system to be administered by means of import licences; whereas to that end detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which should appear in applications and licences should be laid down, if necessary by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1404/97 (7), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1572/97 (9); whereas, moreover, provision should be made for the licences to be issued after a period of consideration and subject where necessary to a uniform percentage reduction;\nWhereas experience has shown that importers do not always inform the competent authorities which have issued their import licences about the number and origin of animals imported as part of a quota; whereas this information is important for assessing the market situation; whereas a security against communication of that information should be provided for;\nWhereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (11), provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate on account of their end-use; whereas the animals imported should be monitored to ensure they are not slaughtered during a certain period; whereas a security should be required to ensure compliance with the requirement for the animals not to be slaughtered;\nWhereas Protocol 4 to the Europe Agreements and Protocol 3 to the Free Trade Agreements have been amended; whereas the new Protocols provide that proof of origin of products imported into the Community may be established by means of a declaration by the exporter, on certain conditions, or by presentation of an EUR.1 movement certificate; whereas, therefore, the new provisions on release for free circulation of imported products should be included in this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2514/96 should be adjusted;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.

All notifications, including notifications of nil applications, shall be made by telex or fax, drawn up on the basis of the specimens in Annexes IV and V in the case where applications have indeed been lodged.", "1. The Commission shall decide to what extent applications may be accepted.\n2. As regards applications referred to in Article 4 (4), if the quantities in respect of which applications are made exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall reduce the quantities applied for by a fixed percentage.\nIf the reduction referred to in the preceding subparagraph results in a quantity of less than 15 head per application, the allocation shall be made by drawing lots, by batches of 15 head, by the Member States concerned. If the remaining quantity is less than 15 head, that quantity shall constitute a single batch.", "1. Imports of the quantities allocated shall be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2. Licence applications may be lodged only with the competent authorities in the Member State where the applicant is registered in the VAT register.\n3. Upon notification of allocation from the Commission, import licences shall be issued at the earliest opportunity at the request and in the name of importers who have obtained rights to import.\n4. Import licences shall be valid for 90 days from their date of issue. However, they shall expire on 30 June 1998 at the latest.\n5. Licences issued shall be valid throughout the Community.\n6.
