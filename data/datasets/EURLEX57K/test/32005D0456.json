The opportunities offered by the Internet should be exploited in order to enable every individual and organisation in the Community to enjoy the social and economic benefits of sharing information and knowledge. The stage has now been set in Europe to exploit the potential of digital content.\n(3) The conclusions of the European Council held in Lisbon on 23 and 24\u00a0March 2000 stressed that the shift to a digital, knowledge-based economy, prompted by new goods and services, will be a powerful engine for growth, competitiveness and jobs. On that occasion the role of the content industries in creating added value by exploiting and networking European cultural diversity was specifically recognised.\n(4) The eEurope 2005 Action Plan, developing the Lisbon strategy, calls for actions to stimulate the emergence of secure services, applications and content over broadband networks and thus to provide a favourable environment for private investment, for the creation of new jobs, to boost productivity, to modernise public services and to give everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society.\n(5) The demand for quality digital content in Europe, with balanced access and user rights, by a broad community, be they citizens in society, students, researchers, SMEs and other business users, or people with special needs wishing to augment their knowledge, or \u2018re\u2010users\u2019 wishing to exploit digital content resources to create services, is increasingly apparent.\n(6) Digital content stakeholders are content providers (including public and private organisations and institutions that create, collect or own digital content) and content users (including organisations and enterprises that are end-users that reuse and/or add value to digital content). Particular attention should be given to the participation of SMEs.\n(7) The eContent Programme (2001 to 2004) adopted by Council Decision\u00a02001/48/EC\u00a0(3), favoured the development and use of European digital content on the Internet and the linguistic diversity of European websites in the information society. The Commission Communication of 10\u00a0October 2003 concerning the mid-term evaluation of the eContent Programme reaffirms the importance of acting in this field.\n(8) Technological advances offer the potential to add value to content in the form of embedded knowledge and to improve interoperability at the service level, which is fundamental to accessing and using and distributing digital content. This is particularly relevant to those areas of public interest to be addressed by this programme.\n(9) Fostering of solid business models will enhance the continuity of the projects initiated under this programme, and will thus improve the conditions for greater economic return from services based on access to, and reuse of, digital content.\n(10) A legislative framework has been defined to deal with the challenges of digital content in the information society\u00a0(4)\n\u00a0(5)\n\u00a0(6).\n(11) Different practices among Member States continue to pose technical obstacles impeding wide access, use, reuse and exploitation of public sector information in the Community.\n(12) Where the digital content involves personal data, Directives 95/46/EC\u00a0(7) and 2002/58/EC\u00a0(8) should be respected and the technologies used should respect and, where possible, enhance privacy.\n(13) Community actions undertaken concerning the content of information should promote the Community's multilingual and multicultural specificity.\n(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(9).\n(15) The Commission should ensure complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes, in particular those related to education and culture and to the European interoperability framework.\n(16) This Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6\u00a0May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure\u00a0(10), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(17) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely aiming at making digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\u00a0States due to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can therefore, by reason of the European scope and effects of the actions, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,", "main_body": ["Objective of the Programme\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision establishes a Community programme for the period 2005 to 2008 to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, facilitating the creation and diffusion of information, in areas of public interest, at Community level.\nThe programme shall be known as the\u2018eContentplus\u2019 programme (hereinafter the Programme).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to attain the overall aim of the Programme, the following lines of action shall be addressed:\n(a) facilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation;\n(b) facilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users, and across sectors;\n(c) reinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness.\nThe activities to be carried out under those lines of action target areas of public sector information, spatial data and educational, cultural and scientific content as set out in Annex\u00a0I.

It will broaden users' choice and support new ways of interacting with knowledge-enhanced digital content, a feature which is becoming essential to make content more dynamic and tailored to specific contexts (learning, cultural, people with special needs, etc.).\nThe Programme will pave the way for a structured framework for quality digital content in Europe \u2014 The European Digital Content Area \u2014 by facilitating transfer of experiences, best practice and cross-fertilisation between content sectors, content providers and users.\n(a) facilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation;\n(b) facilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users, and across sectors;\n(c) reinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LINES OF ACTION\nA. Facilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation\n(a) supporting a wider recognition of the importance of public sector information (PSI), its commercial value and associated societal implications of its use. Activities shall improve effective cross-border use and exploitation of PSI between public sector organisations and private companies, including SMEs, for added-value information products and services;\n(b) encouraging a wider use of spatial data by public sector bodies, private companies, including SMEs, and citizens through cooperation mechanisms at European level. Activities should tackle both technical and organisational issues, avoiding duplications and underdeveloped territorial data sets. They should promote cross-border interoperability, supporting coordination between mapping agencies and fostering the emergence of new services at European level for mobile users. They should also support the use of open standards;\n(c) fostering the proliferation of open European knowledge pools of digital objects, for education and research communities, as well as the individual. The activities will support the creation of trans-European brokering services for digital learning content, with associated business models. The activities should also encourage the use of open standards, and the creation of large user groups analysing and testing pre-standardisation and specifications schemes with a view to conveying European multilingual and multicultural aspects into the process of definition of global standards for digital learning content;\n(d) promoting the emergence of trans-European information infrastructures for accessing and using high quality European digital cultural and scientific resources through the linking of virtual libraries, community memories, etc. Activities should encompass coordinated approaches to digitisation and collection building, preservation of digital objects and inventories of cultural and scientific digital resources. They should improve access to digital cultural and scientific assets through effective licensing schemes and collective pre-emptive clearing of rights.\nB.
