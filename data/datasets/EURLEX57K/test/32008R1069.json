This amendment corrects the error in the assessment of the maximum weight of carcasses which was made at the time the initial application was drawn up and was the result of an incorrect assessment at the time of the yield at slaughter.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified. Since this concerns a minor amendment within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission may adopt it without following the procedure set out in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of that Regulation.\n(4) In accordance with Article 18(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006\u00a0(3) and pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, a summary of the specification should be published.\n(5) The Commission also notes that the name is \u2018Veau d\u2019Aveyron et du S\u00e9gala\u2019 and not \u2018Veau de l\u2019Aveyron et du S\u00e9gala\u2019, as originally entered into the register.
