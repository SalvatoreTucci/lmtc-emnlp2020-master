In the light of a new application and information received by the Commission from third countries since the last publication of the list, certain modifications should be taken into consideration and added or inserted in the list.\n(2) The Australian authorities have informed the Commission that one control body has undergone a restructure and changed its name. The Australian authorities have provided the Commission with the necessary guarantees to satisfy it that the restructured control body meets the preconditions laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.\n(3) Certain agricultural products imported from Japan are currently marketed in the Union pursuant to the transitional rules provided for in Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01235/2008. Japan submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list provided for in Annex III to that Regulation and submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of that information and consequent discussion with the Japanese authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of organic production are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Commission has examined on-the-spot the rules of production and the control measures actually applied in Japan, as provided for in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Consequently, the Commission should include Japan in the list provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 189, 20.7.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 334, 12.12.2008, p. 25.\nANNEX\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n1. in point 5 of the text relating to Australia, the fourth indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 NASAA Certified Organic (NCO), www.nasaa.com.au\u2019;\n2. after the text relating to Israel, the following text is inserted:\n(a) unprocessed crop products and vegetative propagating material and seeds for cultivation;\n(b) processed agricultural products for use as food composed essentially of one or more ingredients of plant origin.\n\u2014 Hyogo prefectural Organic Agriculture Society (HOAS), www.hyoyuken.org\n\u2014 AFAS Certification Center Co., Ltd, www.afasseq.com\n\u2014 NPO Kagoshima Organic Agriculture Association, www.koaa.or.jp\n\u2014 Center of Japan Organic Farmers Group, www.yu-ki.or.jp\n\u2014 Japan Organic & Natural Foods Association, http://jona-japan.org/organic\n\u2014 Ecocert-QAI Japan Ltd, http://ecocert.qai.jp\n\u2014 Japan Certification Services, Inc., www.pure-foods.co.jp\n\u2014 OCIA Japan, www.ocia-jp.com\n\u2014 Overseas Merchandise Inspection Co., Ltd, www.omicnet.com/index.html.en\n\u2014 Organic Farming Promotion Association, www3.ocn.ne.jp/~yusuikyo\n\u2014 ASAC Stands for Axis\u2019 System for Auditing and Certification and Association for Sustainable Agricultural Certification, www.axis-asac.net\n\u2014 Environmentally Friendly Rice Network, www.epfnetwork.org/okome\n\u2014 Ooita Prefecture Organic Agricultural Research Center, www.d-b.ne.jp/oitayuki"}
