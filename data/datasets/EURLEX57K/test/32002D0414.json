This request was supplemented by the transmission of the draft Regional decree on 14 May 2002. The development of new plantations, often under plastic and outside traditional production areas, has a negative impact on environmental protection, in particular as regards the use of water resources and the conservation of the countryside. The development of new banana plantations also jeopardises the maintenance of small plantations on traditional terraces which are crucial to soil stability and the socioeconomic balance. Under these circumstances, granting the compensatory aid referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 to the produce of new banana plantations in the Canary Islands poses a serious a risk to the sustainable economic development of the production areas.\n(3) Examination of the request presented by Spain shows that it complies with the aim and the provisions of Article 12(9) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93. This request should therefore be accepted.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["The request submitted by Spain to the Commission to authorise a measure excluding the produce of new banana plantations planted on or after 1 June 2002 from the compensatory aid referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 over a period of three years is hereby accepted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 47, 25.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 345, 29.12.2001, p. 13."}
