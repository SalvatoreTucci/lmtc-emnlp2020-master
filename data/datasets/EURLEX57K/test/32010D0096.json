In its Resolution 1897 (2009), adopted on 30 November 2009, the UNSC recalled its previous resolutions and reaffirmed its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia.\n(2) In its conclusions of 27 July 2009, the Council decided to step up the engagement for promoting peace and development in Somalia. To this end, the Council studied the possibilities for the Union to contribute to international efforts, including in the field of security.\n(3) In its conclusions of 17 November 2009, the Council stated that further Union support to the Somali security sector should be considered within a comprehensive EU approach to the situation in Somalia, and that this support should be part of a larger and coherent framework involving close EU cooperation and coordination with the African Union, the United Nations and other relevant partners, in particular the United States of America. With regard to the African Union, the Council furthermore underlined the importance of the role of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).\n(4) On 17 November 2009, the Council approved a Crisis Management Concept on a possible European Security and Defence mission to contribute to the training of the security forces of the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and requested further planning work. Subsequently, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) appointed a Planning Authority.\n(5) By letters dated 18 November 2009 and 23 January 2010 respectively, the TFG expressed its appreciation for the Union\u2019s efforts to coordinate the training of the Somali security forces and its efforts towards peace and stability in Somalia, and assured the Union of its commitment to bear its responsibility with regard to the recruitment, training and retention of recruits; it also emphasised its commitment to a broader security sector policy in Somalia.\n(6) By letter dated 30 November 2009, African Union Deputy Special Representative for Somalia, on behalf of the African Union Commission, welcomed the positive reflection of the EU regarding the training of over 2\u00a0000 Somali security forces.\n(7) On 8 December 2009, the Council selected a military strategic option for the potential EU military mission.\n(8) In its report to the UNSC of 31 December 2009, the United Nation\u2019s Secretary-General referred to the Crisis Management Concept regarding a possible European Security and Defence Policy mission to support the training of the Somali security forces and underlined that when the EU planning for the delivery of training would be implemented, the EU trainers would be expected to follow harmonised and approved curricula.\n(9) By letter dated 5 January 2010, the Minister of Defence of Uganda welcomed the Union\u2019s envisaged mission in support of the Somali security sector and invited the Union to participate in the training of Somali security forces in Uganda for a period of at least one year.\n(10) On 20 January 2010, the Union made an offer to the TFG to contribute to the training of the Somali security forces.\n(11) In its conclusions of 25 January 2010, the Council agreed to set up an EU military mission to contribute to the training of Somali security forces in Uganda, where Somali forces are already being trained. The mission would also facilitate the coordination of EU action with AMISOM. The Council furthermore agreed that the EU military mission would be launched with the next intake of trainees, scheduled to start in spring 2010, and that it would be conducted in close coordination with partners, including the TFG, Uganda, the African Union, the United Nations and the United States of America. The Council recognised the need to carry out this training as part of a wider international effort and encompassing, inter alia, the vetting of trainees, the monitoring and mentoring of the forces once back in Mogadishu and the funding and payment of the salaries of the soldiers.\n(12) The PSC should exercise, under the responsibility of the Council and of the HR, political control over the EU military mission, provide it with strategic direction and take the relevant decisions in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 38 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n(13) It is necessary for international agreements relating to the participation of third States in EU missions and to the status of EU units and personnel to be negotiated and concluded.\n(14) The operational expenditure arising from this Decision, which has military or defence implications, should be borne by the Member States pursuant to Article 41(2) of the TEU and in accordance with Council Decision 2008/975/CFSP of 18 December 2008 establishing a mechanism to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications (Athena)\u00a0(1) (hereinafter \u2018ATHENA\u2019).\n(15) Article 28(1) of the TEU calls for Council decisions to lay down the means to be made available to the Union. The financial reference amount, for a 12-month period, for the common costs of the EU military mission constitutes the best current estimate and is without prejudice to the final figures to be included in a budget to be approved in accordance with the rules laid down in ATHENA.\n(16) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Denmark does not, therefore, participate in the financing of this mission,", "main_body": ["Mission\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union shall conduct a military training mission, hereinafter called \u2018EUTM Somalia\u2019, in order to contribute to strengthening the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) as a functioning government serving the Somali citizens.
