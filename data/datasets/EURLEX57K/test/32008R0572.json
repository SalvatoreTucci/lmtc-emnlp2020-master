For this reason the annual fee and the fees relating to technical examination were reduced. The financial reserve of the Office has now decreased to an appropriate level and the revenue should therefore be raised again to a level which is sufficient for the budget of the Office to be balanced. To achieve this, the annual fee and the fees relating to technical examination should be increased.\n(3) As regards new species, the experience gathered with the fee groups for the technical examination of ornamentals, has shown that there is a need to amend some of those fee groups.\n(4) To facilitate the payment of fees and charges, payment by payment cards should be allowed subject to conditions and limitations to be determined by the President of the Office.\n(5) At the same time the terms \u2018ecus\u2019 and \u2018ECU\u2019 should be respectively replaced by the terms \u2018euros\u2019 and \u2018EUR\u2019 throughout Regulation (EC) No 1238/95.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Community Plant Variety Rights,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2), the word \u2018ecus\u2019 is replaced by \u2018euros\u2019;\n2. in Article 3(2), points (a), (b) and (c) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) delivery or remittance of certified cheques which are made payable in euros to the Office;\n(b) transfer in euros to a giro account held by the Office;\n(c) payment into a charge account held in euros with the Office; or\n(d) payment by payment card.\u2019\n3. in Article 7(1), Article 8(1), Article 10(1), points (a), (c) and (d), Article 11(1), Article 13(3) and Article 14(2) and (4), the word \u2018ECU\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u2019;\n4.
