According to Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, that declaration should be drawn up using the model set out in Annex III to that Regulation.\n(2) In accordance with Article 60(e) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, the Commission is delegated the task of adapting Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 in response to technical progress.\n(3) The model set out in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 should be adapted, in order to respond to technological progress, to allow the flexibility required by different kinds of construction products and manufacturers as well as to simplify the declaration of performance.\n(4) Furthermore, practical experience with the implementation of Annex III shows that manufacturers would need further instructions for drawing up declarations of performance on construction products in line with applicable legislation. Providing such instructions would also ensure a harmonised and correct application of Annex III.\n(5) The manufacturers should be allowed some flexibility for drawing up declarations of performance as long as they provide, in a clear and coherent manner, the essential information required by Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0305/2011.\n(6) In order to unequivocally identify the product covered by a declaration of performance in relation with its performance levels or classes, manufacturers should link every single product to the respective product-type and to a given set of performance levels or classes by the unique identification code referred to in Article 6(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.\n(7) The purpose of Article 11(4) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 is to enable the identification and the traceability of any single construction product by the indication, by the manufacturers, of a type, batch or serial number. This purpose is not served by a declaration of performance, which should be subsequently used for all products corresponding to the product-type defined in it. Therefore, the information required by Article 11(4) should not be required to be contained in the declaration of performance.\n(8) When the notified bodies are properly identified, the listing of all certificates, test, calculation or assessment reports issued might become extensive and burdensome but does not bring about added value for the users of the products covered by a declaration of performance. The manufacturers should thus not be obliged to include these listings in their declarations of performance.\n(9) In order to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the European construction sector as a whole, manufacturers providing declarations of performance wishing to benefit from the simplification and instructions for the purposes of facilitating the provision of such declarations should be able to do so as soon as possible,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall be replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "Declarations of performance issued before the entry into force of this Regulation, which comply with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and the initial Annex III thereto, shall be deemed to comply with this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European\u00a0Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a088, 4.4.2011, p.\u00a05.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX III\nDECLARATION OF PERFORMANCE\nNo\n1.

This may be included after point 8 or in another place where it does not affect the readability and clarity of the mandatory information.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FLEXIBILITY\nProviding that the mandatory information required by Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 is provided in a clear, complete and coherent manner, when drawing up a declaration of performance, it is possible to:\n(1) use a different layout as in the model;\n(2) combine the points of the model by presenting some of them together;\n(3) present the points of the model in a different order or using one or more tables;\n(4) omit some points of the model which are not relevant for the product for which a declaration of performance is drawn up. For example, this is the case since the declaration of performance may be based either on a harmonised standard or on a European Technical Assessment issued for the product, rendering the other alternative not applicable. These omissions could also concern the points on the authorised representative or on the use of Appropriate Technical Documentation and the Specific Technical Documentation;\n(5) present the points without numbering them.\nIf a manufacturer wishes to issue a single declaration of performance covering different variations of a product-type, at least the following elements need to be listed separately and clearly for every product variation: the number of the declaration of performance, the identification code under point 1 and the declared performances/s under point\u00a07.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INSTRUCTION FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE FORM\nPoint of the model Instruction\nNumber of the declaration of performance This is the reference number of the declaration of performance foreseen in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.\nPoint 1 Indicate the unique identification code of the product-type referred to in Article 6(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.\nPoint 2 Indicate the intended use, or list the intended uses, as appropriate, of the construction product as foreseen by the manufacturer, in accordance with the applicable harmonised technical specification.\nPoint 3 Indicate the name, the registered trade name or registered trade mark and the contact address of the manufacturer, as required pursuant to Article 11(5) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.\nPoint 4 This point shall be included and filled in only in case an authorised representative has been designated. In such case, indicate the name and the contact address of the authorised representative whose mandate covers the tasks specified in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.\nPoint 5 Indicate the number of the applicable system or systems of assessment and verification of constancy of performance (AVCP) of the construction product as set out in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011. If there are multiple systems, each of them shall be declared.\nPoints 6a and 6b Since a manufacturer can draw up a declaration of performance based on either a harmonised standard or a European Technical Assessment issued for the product, these two different situations presented under points 6a and 6b should be treated as alternative, with only one of them to be applied and filled in in a declaration of performance.\n(a) the reference number of the harmonised standard and its date of issue (dated reference); and\n(b) the identification number of the notified body/ies.\n(a) the number of the European Assessment Document and its date of issue;\n(b) the number of the European Technical Assessment and its date of issue;\n(c) the name of the Technical Assessment Body; and\n(d) the identification number of the notified body/ies.\nPoint 7 Under this point, the declaration of performance shall indicate:\n(a) the list of essential characteristics, as determined in the harmonised technical specifications for the intended use or uses indicated under point 2; and\n(b) for each essential characteristic, the declared performance, by level or class, or in a description, in relation to this characteristic or, for characteristics for which no performance is declared, the letters \u201cNPD\u201d (No Performance Determined).\nPoint 8 This point shall only be included and filled in in a declaration of performance if Appropriate Technical Documentation and/or Specific Technical Documentation has been used, in accordance with Articles 36 to 38 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, in order to indicate the requirements with which the product complies.\n(a) the reference number of the Specific and/or Appropriate Technical Documentation used, and\n(b) the requirements with which the product complies.\nSignature Replace the spaces indicated between square brackets by the information indicated and the signature.\u2019"}
