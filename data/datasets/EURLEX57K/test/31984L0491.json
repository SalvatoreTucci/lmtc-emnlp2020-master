The limit values, the time limits by which they must be complied with and the monitoring procedure for discharges are laid down in Annex I.\n2. The limit values shall normally apply at the point where waste waters containing HCH leave the industrial plant.\nIf waste waters containing HCH are treated outside the industrial plant at a treatment plant intended for the removal of HCH, the Member State concerned may permit the limit values to be applied at the point where the waste waters leave the treatment plant.\n3. The authorizations provided for in Article 3 of Directive 76/464/EEC must contain provisions at least as stringent as those in Annex I to this Directive, except where a Member State is complying with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC on the basis of Annexes II and IV to this Directive.\nAuthorizations shall be reviewed at least every four years.\n4. Without prejudice to their obligations arising from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and to the provisions of Directive 76/464/EEC, Member States may grant authorizations for new plants only if those plants apply the standards corresponding to the best technical means available when that is necessary for the elimination of pollution in accordance with Article 2 of the said Directive or for the prevention of distortions of competition.\nWhatever method it adopts, the Member State concerned shall, where for technical reasons the measures envisaged do not correspond to the best technical means available, provide the Commission, before any authorization, with evidence in support of these reasons.\nThe Commission shall forward this evidence to the other Member States immediately and shall send all Member States a report, as soon as possible, giving its opinion on the derogation referred to in the second subparagraph.

Meanwhile, the Member States will independently fix emission standards for the discharges from such plants, taking into account the best technical means available.\n(b) Limit values by weight (monthly average).\n(c) Limit values by concentration (monthly flow-weighted average concentration of HCH).\n(d) Limit values applicable to the total quantity of HCH present in all discharges of water containing HCH coming from the site of the industrial plant.\n2. Limit values expressed as concentrations which in principle must not be exceeded are given in the above table. In no instance may limit values expressed as maximum concentrations be greater than limit values expressed by weight divided by water requirements per tonne of HCH produced or treated.\nThe limit values by weight given in the above table, expressed in terms of the quantity of HCH discharged in relation to the quantity of HCH produced or treated, must be complied with in all cases.\n3. The daily average limit values are, when monitored in accordance with the provisions in points 4 and 5 below, twice the corresponding monthly average limit values given in the above table. 4. A monitoring procedure must be instituted to check whether the discharges comply with the emission standards which have been fixed in accordance with this Directive.\nThis procedure must provide for the taking and analysis of samples and for measurement of the flow of the discharge and the quantity of HCH produced or treated. Should the quantity of HCH produced or treated be impossible to determine, the monitoring procedure may, at most, be based on the quantity of HCH likely to be produced or treated during the period in question, taking into account the production plants in operation, and within the limits on which the authorization was based.\n5. A sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours will be taken. The quantity of HCH discharged over a month must be calculated on the basis of the daily quantities of HCH discharged.\nHowever, a simplified monitoring procedure may be instituted in the case of industrial plants which do not discharge more than 3 kg of HCH per annum.\nANNEX  II\nQUALITY OBJECTIVES\nFor those Member States which apply the exception provided for in Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the emission standards which Member States must establish and ensure are applied, pursuant to Article 5 of that Directive, will be fixed so that the appropriate quality objective or objectives from among those listed below is (are) complied with in the area affected by discharges of HCH. The competent authority will determine the area affected in each case and will select from among the quality objectives listed in paragraph 1 the objective or objectives that it deems appropriate having regard to the intended use of the area affected, while taking account of the fact that the purpose of this Directive is to eliminate all pollution.\n1. The following quality objectives (1), which will be measured at a point sufficiently close to the point of discharge, are hereby laid down pursuant to Article 2 of Directive 76/464/EEC with the object of eliminating pollution within the meaning of that Directive (2).\n1.1. The total HCH concentration in inland surface waters affected by discharges must not exceed 100 nanograms per litre.\n1.2. The total concentration of HCH in estuary waters and territorial sea waters must not exceed 20 nanograms per litre.\n1.3. In the case of water used for the abstraction of drinking water, the HCH content must conform to the requirements of Directive 75/440/EEC (3).\n2. In addition to the above requirements, HCH concentrations in inland surface waters must be determined by the national network referred to in Article 5 of this Directive and the results compared with a total HCH concentration of 50 nanograms per litre.\nIf this concentration is not complied with at any one of the points on the national network, the reasons must be reported to the Commission.\n3. The total concentration of HCH in sediments and/or molluscs and/or shellfish and/or fish must not increase significantly with time.\n4. Where several quality objectives are applied to waters in an area, the quality of the waters must be sufficient to comply with each of those objectives.\n(1) The concentrations indicated in 1.1 and 1.2 are the minimum requirements necessary to protect aquatic life from pollution within the meaning of Article 1 (2) (e) of Directive 76/464/EEC.\n(2) With the exception of quality objective 1.3, all concentrations relate to the arithmetic mean of the results obtained over one year.\n(3) Directive 75/440/EEC concerns the quality required of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States (OJ No L 194, 25. 7. 1975, p. 26). It provides for a mandatory 'total pesticides' value (including HCH).\nANNEX  III\nMETHODS OF MEASUREMENT\n1. The reference method of analysis for determining the concentration of the substances in question in discharges and in waters will be gas chromotography with electron capture detection after extraction by means of an appropriate solvent and purification.\nThe accuracy (1) and precision (1) of the method must be \u00c2\u0105 50 % at a concentration which represents twice the value of the limit of detection.\nThe limit of detection (1) must be:\n- in the case of discharges, one-tenth of the concentration required at the point of sampling;\n- in the case of waters subject to a quality objective:\n(i) for inland surface waters, one-tenth of the concentration indicated in the quality objective;\n(ii) for estuary waters and territorial sea waters, one-fifth of the concentration indicated in the quality objective;\n- in the case of sediments, 1 mg/kg, dry weight;\n- in the case of living organisms, 1 mg/kg, wet weight.\n2. Effluent flow measurements must be carried out to an accuracy of \u00c2\u0105 20 %.\n(1) The definitions of these terms are given in Directive 79/869/EEC of 9 October 1979 concerning the methods of measurement and frequencies of sampling and analysis of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States (OJ No L 271, 29. 10. 1979, p. 44).\nANNEX  IV\nPROCEDURE FOR MONITORING QUALITY OBJECTIVES\n1. For each authorization granted pursuant to this Directive, the competent authority will specify the detailed rules monitoring procedure and time limits for ensuring compliance with the quality objective(s) concerned.\n2. In accordance with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the Member States will, for each quality objective chosen and applied, report to the Commission on:\n- the points of discharge and the means of dispersal,\n- the area in which the quality objective is applied,\n- the location of sampling points,\n- the frequency of sampling,\n- the methods of sampling and measurement,\n- the results obtained.\n3. Samples must be sufficiently representative of the quality of the aquatic environment in the area affected by the discharges, and the frequency of sampling must be sufficient to show any changes in the aquatic environment, having regard in particular to natural variations in the water regime."}
