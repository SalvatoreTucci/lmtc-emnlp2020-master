It is forecast to decline to 1,7 % of GDP in 1998. According to the 1997 convergence programme of Belgium, the government deficit is projected to decline further to 1,4 % of GDP in 2000.\nThe government debt ratio peaked in 1993 at 135,2 % of GDP but has been declining every year since then to 122,2 % in 1997. A further decline is expected for 1998 and projected to continue in the following years in the Belgian convergence programme.\nThe reduction of the deficit and in particular the level reached by the primary surplus, amounting to more than 5 % of GDP since 1994, have contributed to putting the debt ratio on a downward path. Since the adoption of its convergence programme, the Belgian government has reconfirmed its commitment to maintain the primary surplus at the level of some 6 % of GDP over the medium term. This primary surplus is essential to maintaining the debt ratio on its sustainable downward path.\nThe deficit was below the Treaty reference value in 1997 and is expected to remain so in 1998 and to decline further in the medium term; the government debt ratio has been decreasing in the last four years and is expected to decline further in coming years,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Belgium has been corrected.", "The Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Belgium is hereby abrogated.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 May 1998.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
