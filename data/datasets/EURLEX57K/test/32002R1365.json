The current level of implementation of the specific supply arrangement indicates that the quantities set for Martinique are below the requirements of this region. The quantities set for Guadeloupe are at present sufficient to meet that region's requirements.\n(3) Thus, by letter dated 13 June 2002, the French authorities submitted a request for a transfer of 10000 tonnes from the balance for Guadeloupe to the balance for Martinique in order to meet the legitimate supply needs of the latter.\n(4) As a result, the distribution of the quantities of common wheat originally laid down in the supply balances for these two islands should be amended and the requested transfer carried out.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 July 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(2) OJ L 8, 11.1.2002, p. 15.\n(3) OJ L 188, 17.7.2002, p. 3.\nANNEX\n\"Part 1\nCereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feed; oilseeds, protein crops, dried fodder\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\nThe products in this part are 100 % interchangeable for one and the same department.\""}
