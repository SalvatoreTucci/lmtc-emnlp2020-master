Access to the quotas concerned should therefore be extended to those traders known as \"new arrivals\".\n(3) There is a sharp increase in the number of \"new arrivals\" submitting applications under certain tariff quotas. The access criterion should therefore be made more rigorous where trade in live animals is concerned.\n(4) The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises have disturbed trade in livestock. The reference periods fixed for traditional traders and new arrivals should therefore end before these crises began.\n(5) In order to prevent speculation:\n- a security relating to import rights should be fixed,\n- the possibility of transferring import licences should be excluded.\n(6) In order to oblige traders to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, this obligation should be a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(9).\n(7) The Regulations listed in the first recital therefore need to be amended accordingly.\n(8) In view of the dates for submission of applications for import rights, this Regulation must take effect immediately.\n(9) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 is amended as follows:\n1.
