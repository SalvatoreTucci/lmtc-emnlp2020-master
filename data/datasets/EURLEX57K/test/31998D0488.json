Product source\nA soil improver will only be considered for the award of an eco-label if its organic matter content is provided by constituents derived from the processing and/or re-use of waste materials (as defined in Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and in Annex I to the said Directive).\nNote: the term 'organic` refers in the general sense to materials of, or formed from/by, living organisms.\nProducts must not contain sewage sludge.\nProducts which include materials of animal origin shall comply with the provisions set out by existing Community legislation.\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n2. Soil degradation and water pollution\nIn the final product, the content of the following elements must be lower than the values shown below, measured in terms of dry weight:\n>TABLE>\nProducts must not contain bark which has been treated with lindane, cypermethrin or promecarb. If the product contains bark, traces of lindane (\u0102\u0141 - HCH) in the bark must not exceed 0,1 mg/kg.\n3. Nutrient loadings\nThe concentration of nitrogen in the product must not exceed 2 % total N (of dry matter).\nWhen used at the recommended rates of application, products must not exceed maximum nutrient loadings of:\n- 17 g/m2 total nitrogen,\n- 6 g/m2 P2O5,\n- 12 g/m2 K2O.\nNote: Products will be exempt from this requirement if less than 10 % (w/w) of the nutrient content is available for plant growth during the first season of application. Such products (for example many mulches) are defined as those having a C:N ratio greater than 30:1.\nOTHER REQUIREMENTS\n4. General labelling\nThe following information must be provided either on the packaging or by other means (e.g. leaflet) with the product:\n- the name and address of the body responsible for marketing,\n- a descriptor identifying the product by type, including the phrase 'soil improver`,\n- recommended conditions of storage and the recommended 'use by` date, together with a manufacturing batch code,\n- a description of the purpose for which the product is intended and any limitations to use. The suitability of the product for particular plant groups (e.g. calcifuges or calcicoles) should be stated,\n- the major feedstocks (those over 10 % by volume) from which the product has been manufactured, distinguishing between municipal solid waste, wastes from agriculture or forestry, industrial and commercial wastes specifying the sector (e.g. food processing, paper, etc.),\n- a statement on recommended methods of use and rate of application expressed as kilograms or litres of product per m2 of ground per annum; the application rate shall take into account the content and availability of nutrients in order not to exceed the maximum nutrient loadings per m2,\n- a statement on the concentrations of N, P2O5 and K2O,\n- a statement on the concentrations of organic matter,\n- a table or list with the concentration limits for the heavy metals mentioned in this Annex,\n- guidelines for safe handling and use.\n5. Product performance\nAll products must be supplied in a solid form and contain not less than 25 % dry matter by weight and not less than 20 % organic matter (measured by loss of ignition). Products must not adversely affect plant emergence or subsequent growth.\n6. Health and safety\nProducts must not exceed the maximum levels of primary pathogens set out in the table below:\n>TABLE>\n7. Nuisance\nNo product shall give rise to persistent offensive odours after being applied to the soil.\nNo product shall contain any fragments of glass, wire, other metal or hard plastic which may constitute a hazard to human health.\nNo product shall introduce unacceptable numbers of weed seeds or the vegetative reproductive parts of aggressive weeds into the soil.\n8. Test methods and analysis\nTest methods and analysis for heavy metals are to be in accordance with the requirements of Directive 86/278/EEC. In the absence of internationally agreed test methods for physical and microbiological analysis as well as for other requirements in relation to soil improvers the test method is the responsibility of Member States.\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nThe product must bear the following information on the packaging:\nThis product qualifies for the EU eco-label, because:\nit contributes to the reduction of soil and water pollution and minimises waste by promoting its use or re-use."}
