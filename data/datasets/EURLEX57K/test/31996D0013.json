ECO-LABEL CRITERIA - GENERAL\nProducts shall be in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 880/92 on a Community eco-label award scheme and with the following criteria during the entire period covered by the contract with the Competent Body for the award of the label.\nThe criteria are classified into three types:\n- ecological criteria (paragraph 4),\n- general criteria (paragraph 5),\n- fitness-for-use criteria (paragraph 6).\nSome of these criteria are dependent on:\n- the kind of product: paint or varnish as defined in Appendix 1,\n- the class of paint: class 1 or class 2, as defined in paragraph 3.\n2. FIELD OF APPLICATION\nAs far as paints are concerned the following, in particular, are included in the field of application:\n- decorative indoor paints in liquid or paste formulas which have been pre-conditioned, tinted or prepared by the manufacturer to meet the consumer's needs,\n- products which are tinted by distributors at the request of amateur or professional decorators.\nThe following are excluded from the field of application:\n- anti-corrosion coatings,\n- anti-fouling coatings,\n- wood preservation products,\n- wood stains,\n- coating for particular industrial uses,\n- floor coatings,\n- facade coatings.\n3. CLASSIFICATION OF PRODUCTS\nPaints are classified according to their specular gloss. Two classes are defined:\n- Class 1: Paints with a specular gloss below or equal to 45 units at \u00e1=60\u00b0 (1)\n- Class 2: Paints with a specular gloss above 45 units at \u00e1=60\u00b0 (2)\nCriteria applicable to class 2 paints are also applicable to varnishes.\nCommunity eco-label requirements on paints and varnishes take into account this classification, particularly for criteria No 3 (volatile organic compounds content), No 4 (volatile aromatic hydrocarbons content), No 9.A (hiding power) and No 9.B (resistance to liquids).\nCriterion No 1: end use of the product\napplicable to all products.\nThe packaging should state clearly that the product is intended for indoor use.\n4. ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\nCriterion No 2: white pigments (see definition (2) in Appendix 1)\napplicable to paints.\nThe paint will have a white pigments content lower or equal to 40 g per m2 of dry film, with 98 % opacity.\nMeasurement of product necessary to cover 1 m2 area with a 98 % opacity will be made in accordance with ISO 6504/l method (see also criterion No 9.A).\nThree types of white pigments consistent with the definition (2) given in Appendix 1 are usually used for the product group: titanium dioxide (TiO2), lithopone and zinc oxide.\nIn the case of TiO2, the following criteria will apply for emissions and discharges of wastes related to the production of white pigment:\n- SOx emissions (expressed as SO2) lower than 400 mg per m2 of dry film (98 % opacity),\n- sulphate wastes lower than 30 g per m2 of dry film (98 % opacity),\n- chlorine wastes lower than 5, 9 and 18 g per m2 of dry film (98 % opacity) respectively for neutral rutile, synthetic rutile and slag ores.\nCriterion No 3: volatile organic compounds content (VOC) (definition (3) in Appendix 1).\nMaximum volatile organic compounds content depends on the product:\n3.A. For Class 1 paints:\nVOC content will be lower or equal to 30 g/l (minus water).\n3.B. For varnishes and Class 2 paints:\nVOC content will be lower or equal to 200 g/l (3) (minus water).\nVOC content unit used is: 'mass in grammes of VOC per litre of product (g/l minus water)`.\nCriterion No 4: volatile aromatic hydrocarbons (see definition (4) in Appendix 1).\nMaximum aromatic content depends on the product:\n4.A. For Class 1 paints:\nVolatile aromatic content will be lower or equal to 0.5 % (4) of product.\n4.B. For varnishes and Class 2 paints:\nVolatile aromatic content will be lower or equal to 1.5 % (5) of product.\nCriterion No 5: water pollution coming from the cleaning of application tools\napplicable to all products.\nThe packaging should display recommendations for cleaning of tools in order to limit water pollution.\nThese recommendations will be adapted by the paint manufacturer to the type of product in question.\nCriterion No 6: solid waste\napplicable to all products.\nIn order to limit solid waste (residues and can), the packaging shall display recommendations concerning product storage conditions after opening.\n5. GENERAL CRITERIA\nCriterion No 7: Pigments and other substances\napplicable to all products.\nThe ingredients used in the formula shall not contain substances using or based on:\n- Cadmium,\n- Lead,\n- Chromium VI,\n- Mercury,\n- Arsenic.\nNeither shall the ingredients used in the formula contain dibutyl, dioctyl or di(2-ethyl-hexyl)phthalates.\nCriterion No 8: dangerous substances\napplicable to all products.\nIngredients used in the formula shall not contain substances classified as:\n- very toxic,\n- toxic,\n- carcinogenic,\n- mutagenic,\n- toxic for reproduction,\nas defined in Council Directive 67/548/EEC.\n6. FITNESS-FOR-USE CRITERIA\nEco-label requirements may not 'compromise product or workers' safety or significantly affect the properties which make a product fit for use` (Council Regulation (EEC) No 880/92). The following fitness-for-use criteria are intended to guarantee to the consumer that awarded products have as satisfactory qualities from the point of view of fitness for use as other products from the same group.\nCriterion No 9: fitness for use.\nFitness-for-use criteria differ according to the kind of product: paint or varnish.\n9.A. For paints: hiding power.\nPaints shall have a hiding power greater than or equal to 7 m2 coated by one litre of product (6)\n9.B. For varnishes: resistance to liquid.\nVarnishes shall have satisfactory resistance to water for one hour at ambient temperature (7).\nAppendix 1\nDEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions apply within the scope of the present product group.\n1. Paints and varnishes\nPaints and varnishes are defined as products, which are applied in thin covering layers onto a surface of wood, stone, metal or other material for the purpose of protecting and/or beautifying that surface. After application, the paint or varnish dries to a solid, adherent and protective coating.\nPaints are characterized by their hiding power.\nVarnishes are characterized by their lack of hiding power: they are transparent.\n2. White pigments\nWhite inorganic pigments with a refractive index higher than 1,8.\n3. Volatile organic compound (VOC)\nAny organic compound with, at normal conditions for pressure, a boiling point (or initial boiling point) lower than or equal to 250 \u00b0C.\n4. Volatile aromatic hydrocarbon\nAny hydrocarbon with, at standard conditions for pressure, a boiling point lower or equal to 250 \u00b0C and having at least one aromatic nucleus in its developed structural formula.\n5. Product/product range\nThe product is understood as a paint or a varnish, to be submitted to the whole assessment procedure.\nThe product range includes the base and the product based on it.\n6. Tinting system\nA tinting system is made up of a white, medium or neutral base and coloured pastes with which, by means of preprogrammed mixing, it is possible to obtain all the shades of colour specific to that brand of product and range.\nAppendix 2\nSTANDARD REFERENCES\nISO 2812-1 'Paints and varnishes - determination of resistance to liquids - Part 1: general methods`.\nISO 2813 'Paints and varnishes - measurement of specular gloss of non-metallic paint films at 20 degrees, 60 degrees and 85 degrees`.\nISO 6504/1 'Paints and varnishes - determination of hiding power - Part 1: Kubelka-Munt method for white and light-coloured paints`.\n(1) Specular gloss measurements are carried out in accordance with the ISO 2813 method.\n(2) In the case of paints for which the manufacturer demonstrates, using ISO test 6504/l method, that the paint has a superior covering performance of at least 15 m2/l at 98 % opacity, then up to 250 g/l (minus water) of VOC content is permitted. The manufacturer should explain and draw attention to this superior performance on the can.\n(3) % is expressed in mass of aromatic content versus mass of total product (m/m).\n(4) Hiding power measurements are carried out following the ISO 6504/l method.\n(5) Resistance to liquid measurements are carried out in accordance with ISO 2812/l - method 3."}
