The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof, and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from Rank Nutrition Ltd, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01924/2006, the Authority was asked to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to \u2018Increasing maternal folate status by supplemental folate intake and reduced risk of neural tube defects.\u2019 (Question No EFSA-Q-2013-00265)\u00a0(2). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Folic acid supplementation raises maternal red blood cell folate. Low maternal red blood cell folate is a risk factor for neural tube defects in the developing foetus\u2019.\n(6) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 26 July 2013 that a cause and effect relationship had been established between increasing maternal folate status by supplemental folate intake and a reduced risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims.\n(7) Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that an opinion in favour of authorising a health claim is to include certain particulars. Accordingly, those particulars should be set out in the Annex to this Regulation as regards the authorised claim and include, as the case may be, the revised wording of the claim, specific conditions of use of the claim, and, where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use of the food and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinion of the Authority.\n(8) One of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is to ensure that health claims are truthful, clear and reliable and useful to the consumer, and that wording and presentation are taken into account in that respect. Therefore where the wording of claims has the same meaning for consumers as that of an authorised health claim, because they demonstrate the same relationship that exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health, they should be subject to the same conditions of use indicated in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The health claim listed in the Annex to this Regulation may be made on foods placed on the Union market in compliance with the conditions laid down in that Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The health claim referred to in paragraph 1 shall be included in the Union list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0404, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(7):3328.\nANNEX\nPERMITTED HEALTH CLAIM\nApplication \u2014 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Applicant \u2014 Address Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim Conditions of use of the claim Conditions and/or restrictions of use of the food and/or additional statement or warning EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 14(1)(a) health claim referring to a reduction of a disease risk Rank Nutrition Ltd, Long Barn, Etchden Court, Bethersden, Kent, TN26\u00a03DP, United Kingdom.
