Depending on the source of power which is necessary for the deflection of the steered wheels, the following types of steering equipment are identified:\n1.2.1.1. Manual steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided solely by the muscular power of the driver;\n1.2.1.2. Assisted steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided both by the muscular power of the driver and by the special equipment defined in point 1.1.4;\n1.2.1.3. Servo-steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided solely by the special equipment defined in point 1.1.4.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steering effort\n\u2018Steering effort\u2019 means the force exerted by the driver on the steering control in order to steer the tractor.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONSTRUCTION, FITTING AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General requirements\n2.1.1. The steering equipment must ensure easy and safe handling of the tractor and must comply with the detailed requirements set out in point 2.2.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detailed requirements\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steering control\n2.2.1.1. The steering control must be easy to use and grip. It must be designed in such a way as to permit gradual deflection. The direction of movement of the steering control must correspond to the desired change in the direction of the tractor.\n2.2.1.2. The steering effort required to achieve a turning circle of 12\u00a0m radius, starting from the straight ahead position, must not exceed 25\u00a0daN. In the case of assisted steering equipment that is not connected to other equipment, if the auxiliary power supply fails the steering effort required must not exceed 60\u00a0daN.\n2.2.1.3. In order to check compliance with the requirement in point 2.2.1.2, the tractor shall describe a spiral movement at a speed of 10 kilometres per hour, starting from the straight ahead position, on a dry, flat road surface offering good tyre adhesion. The steering effort on the steering control shall be noted until it reaches the position corresponding to the tractor entering a turning circle of 12\u00a0m radius. The duration of the manoeuvre (time between the moment when the steering control is first operated and the moment when it reaches the position where the measurements are taken) must not exceed five seconds in normal cases and eight seconds if the special equipment fails. One manoeuvre must be made to the left and one to the right.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steering gear\n2.2.2.1. The steering equipment may not include either electrical or wholly pneumatic steering gear.\n2.2.2.2. The steering gear must be so designed as to meet any operational requirements. It must be easily accessible for maintenance and inspection.\n2.2.2.3. In the case of steering gear which is not wholly hydraulic, it must be possible to drive the tractor even in the event of failure of the hydraulic or pneumatic components of the steering gear.\n2.2.2.4. Steering gear which is operated purely hydraulically and the special equipment defined in point 1.1.4 must meet the following requirements:\n2.2.2.4.1. One or more pressure limitation devices must protect the whole or part of the circuit against excess pressure;\n2.2.2.4.2. The pressure limitation devices must be set so as not to exceed a pressure T equal to the maximum operating pressure stated by the manufacturer;\n2.2.2.4.3. The characteristics and dimensions of the pipe work must be such that the pipes withstand four times the pressure T (permitted by the pressure limitation devices), and must be protected in places and arranged in such a way that the risks of damage by impact or interference are reduced to a minimum, and the risks of damage by rubbing can be considered negligible.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steered wheels\n2.2.3.1. All the wheels may be steered wheels.\n2.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Special equipment\n2.2.4.1. The special equipment defined in point 1.1.4, used in the types of steering equipment defined in points 1.2.1.2 and 1.2.1.3, shall be acceptable in the following circumstances:\n2.2.4.1.1. If the tractor is equipped with assisted steering equipment as defined in point 1.2.1.2, it must be possible to drive it even in the event of failure of the special equipment as already stated in point 2.2.1.2. If the assisted steering equipment does not have its own source of power, it must be fitted with a power reservoir. This power reservoir may be replaced by a self-contained device providing power supply to the steering equipment with priority over the other systems which are linked to the common energy source. Without prejudice to the provisions of Council Directive 76/432/EEC of 6 April 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors\u00a0(1), if there is a hydraulic connection between the hydraulic steering equipment and the hydraulic braking equipment, and if both are supplied from the same energy source, the force required to activate the steering equipment shall not exceed 40\u00a0daN if either of the systems should fail. If the source of power is compressed air, the air reservoir must be protected by a non-return valve.\n2.2.4.1.2. If the tractor is fitted with servo-steering equipment as defined in point 1.2.1.3, and provided that such equipment has a wholly hydraulic steering gear, it must be possible, should the special device or motor fail, to carry out the two manoeuvres specified in point 2.2.1.3 using a special additional device. The special additional device may be a compressed air or gas reservoir. An oil pump or compressor may be used as the special additional device if that device is worked by the rotation of the tractor wheels and cannot be disconnected from them. In the event of failure of the special equipment, a visual or acoustic signal must give warning of such failure.\n2.2.4.1.2.1. If the special device is pneumatic, it must be fitted with a compressed air reservoir protected by a non-return valve. The capacity of the compressed air reservoir must be calculated so that at least seven complete turns (from lock to lock) are possible before the reservoir pressure falls to half its operating pressure; the test must be carried out with the steered wheels off the ground.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0122, 8.5.1976, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX II\nPART A\nRepealed Directive with its successive amendments\n(referred to in Article 6)\nCouncil Directive 75/321/EEC\nCouncil Directive 82/890/EEC Only as regards the references to Directive 75/321/EEC in Article 1(1)\nCommission Directive 88/411/EEC\nDirective 97/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Only as regards the references to Directive 75/321/EEC in the first indent of Article 1\nCommission Directive 98/39/EC\nPART B\nList of time-limits for transposition into national law and application\n(referred to in Article 6)\nDirective Time-limit for transposition Date of application\n75/321/EEC 22 November 1976 \u2014\n82/890/EEC 22 June 1984 \u2014\n88/411/EEC 30 September 1988\u00a0(1) \u2014\n97/54/EC 22 September 1998 23 September 1998\n98/39/EC 30 April 1999\u00a0(2) \u2014\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0In conformity with Article 2 of Directive 88/411/EEC:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 October 1988 no Member State may:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of tractor, to grant EEC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in Article 10(1), final indent, of Directive 74/150/EEC, or to grant national type approval, or,\n\u2014 prohibit the entry into service of tractors,\nif the steering equipment of this type of tractor or tractors complies with the provisions of this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 October 1989 Member States:\n\u2014 shall no longer issue the document referred to in Article 10(1), final indent, of Directive 74/150/EEC for a type of tractor the steering equipment of which does not comply with the provisions of this Directive,\n\u2014 may refuse to grant national type approval for a type of tractor, the steering equipment of which does not comply with the provisions of this Directive.\u2019,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0In conformity with Article 2 of Directive 98/39/EC:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 May 1999 no Member State may:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of tractor, to grant EC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC, or to grant national type-approval, or,\n\u2014 to prohibit the entry into service of tractors,\nif these tractors meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 October 1999, Member States:\n\u2014 may no longer issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC for any type of tractor that does not meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive,\n\u2014 may refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of a type of tractor that does not meet the requirements of Directive 75/321/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\u2019\nANNEX III\nCorrelation table\nDirective 75/321/EEC Directive 98/39/EC This Directive\nArticle 1  Article 1\nArticle 2 Article 2\nArticles 3 and 4  Articles 3 and 4\nArticle 5(1)  \u2014\nArticle 5(2)  Article 5\n\u2014  Article 6\n\u2014  Article 7\nArticle 6  Article 8\nAnnex  Annex I\n\u2014  Annex II\n\u2014  Annex III"}
