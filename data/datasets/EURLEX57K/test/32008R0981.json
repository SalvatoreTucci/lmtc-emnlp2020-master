However, Chapter\u00a0I of Title\u00a0V of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 relating to oenological practices and processes, Article\u00a070 thereof, and the corresponding provisions contained in particular in the Annexes to that Regulation continue to apply until 31\u00a0July 2009.\n(2) Point\u00a0A(2) of Annex\u00a0V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 provides for derogations to the maximum total sulphur dioxide content for certain categories of wine with a residual sugar content of not less than five grams per litre.\n(3) Point\u00a0B(3) of Annex\u00a0V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 provides for the possibility of derogating from the maximum total volatile acid content for certain categories of wine.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008\u00a0(3) lays down certain detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 relating in particular to the maximum total sulphur dioxide content and the maximum total volatile acid content of wine. In particular, Article\u00a023(1) of that Regulation provides that the amendments to the lists of wines in point\u00a0A(2) of Annex\u00a0V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 are as set out in Annex\u00a0XIV to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008, and Article\u00a024 of that Regulation provides that the wines covered by exceptions regarding the maximum volatile acid content in accordance with point\u00a0B(3) of Annex\u00a0V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 are as set out in Annex\u00a0XVI to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008.\n(5) Certain white Portuguese quality wines psr \u2018Douro\u2019 accompanied by the term \u2018colheita tardia\u2019 have a residual sugar content of not less than 80\u00a0g/l and, for their preservation in good quality conditions, require a sulphur dioxide content above the general limit of 260\u00a0mg/l but less than 400\u00a0mg/l. Those wines should therefore be added to the list in point (b) of the first paragraph of Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008.\n(6) Certain Spanish quality wines psr with the designation of origin \u2018Rioja\u2019 or the designation of origin \u2018M\u00e1laga\u2019 and certain white Portuguese quality wines psr \u2018Douro\u2019, which are made using special methods and have a total alcoholic strength by volume greater than 13\u00a0% vol., normally have a volatile acid content above the limits laid down in point B(1) of Annex\u00a0V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999 but less than 25, 35 or 40 milliequivalents per litre depending on the wine in question. Those wines should therefore be added to the list in Annex\u00a0XVI to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008.\n(7) Article\u00a044 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0423/2008 lays down general rules for the experimental use of new oenological practices by Member States. The condition laid down in point (c) of paragraph\u00a01 of that Article, which bans wine that has undergone experimental oenological practices authorised by a Member State from being sent outside that Member State, is causing difficulties for operators, in particular in evaluating the economic impact of the experimental practices. This restrictive condition should be abolished where the practice concerned has already been recommended and published by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV).\n(8) The possibility for wine that has undergone experimental oenological practices to move within the Community must be effectively controlled and requires the experimental practices used for it to be indicated on the accompanying document referred to in Article\u00a070(1) and in the register referred to in Article\u00a070(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01493/1999.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 423/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 423/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
