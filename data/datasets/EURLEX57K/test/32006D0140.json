Therefore minimum requirements for the establishment of breeding programmes for resistance to TSEs in sheep have been laid down in Commission Decision 2003/100/EC\u00a0(2). Very limited information is however available on TSE resistant PrP genes in goats.\n(3) Verification of the existence of TSE resistant genotypes in goats is necessary in order to develop community legislation in the veterinary field, in particular on the control and possible eradication of TSEs in such animals.\n(4) A bi-annual survey on TSEs resistant genotypes in goats was submitted by the Cypriot authorities in 2005, with a view to obtain financial support from the Community. The objectives of the survey are to further investigate the PrP gene of the Cyprus goats in order to confirm the results of previous preliminary studies where specific PrP polymorphisms were found indicating resistance against TSEs and to evaluate the data in order to be able to determine the baseline prevalence of TSE resistant PrP genes in goats. Cyprus has a very high prevalence of TSEs in goats and is therefore the appropriate Member State to carry out such pilot project. The survey intends to start on 1 January 2006.\n(5) The survey will be executed by the Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment of Cyprus. The Community Reference Laboratory for TSE will provide scientific supervision of the survey.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 2, of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999\u00a0(3), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(7) A financial contribution from the Community shall be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for. For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year.\n(8) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of the payment applications submitted in national currency as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro\u00a0(4).\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The survey programme for TSE resistant PrP genes in goats presented by Cyprus is hereby approved for a period of 12 months starting from 1 January 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial assistance from the Community for the programme referred to in paragraph 1 covers the costs (VAT excluded) incurred by Cyprus for laboratory testing up to 100\u00a0% in accordance with the provisions in Chapter 1 of the Annex.
