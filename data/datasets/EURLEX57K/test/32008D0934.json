That list includes the substances enumerated in the Annex to this Decision.\n(3) Within two months from receipt of the draft assessment report the notifiers concerned voluntarily withdrew, in accordance with Article 11e of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, their support for the inclusion of those substances.\n(4) The Commission has examined the draft assessment reports, the recommendations from the rapporteur Member States and the comments from other Member States and has come to the conclusion that Articles 11b and 11f do not apply. Consequently, Article 11e applies.\n(5) The substances listed in the Annex to this Decision should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(6) As the non-inclusion of these substances is not based on the presence of clear indications of harmful effects as laid down in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, Member States should have the possibility to maintain authorisations until 31 December 2010, in accordance with Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.\n(7) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing the listed substances should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.\n(8) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of a new application under Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(4) in accordance with the accelerated procedure provided for in Articles 13 to 22 of that Regulation.\n(9) That procedure allows notifiers whose substance has not been included based on their withdrawal, to make a new application submitting only the additional data necessary to address the specific issues that led to the adoption of the non-inclusion Decision. The notifier has received the draft assessment report which identifies those data.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The substances listed in the Annex to this Decision shall not be included as active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing one or several of the substances listed in the Annex by 31 December 2010 at the latest.", "Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC shall expire on 31 December 2011 at the latest.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 55, 29.2.2000, p. 25.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 21.8.2002, p. 23.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 18.1.2008, p. 5.\nANNEX\nList of active substances referred to in Article 1\nActive substance Draft assessment report communicated to the notifier on\nAcetochlor 14 December 2005\nAcrinathrin 8 October 2007\nAsulam 28 July 2006\nBitertanol 23 March 2006\nBupirimate 7 August 2007\nCarbetamide 31 August 2006\nCarboxin 28 July 2006\nChloropicrin 19 April 2006\nClethodim 19 April 2006\nCycloxydim 28 February 2007\nCyproconazole 15 September 2006\nDazomet 8 October 2007\nDiclofop-methyl 10 September 2007\nDiethofencarb 24 October 2007\nDithianon 5 February 2007\nDodine 29 March 2007\nEthalfluralin 4 October 2007\nEtridiazole 7 August 2007\nFenazaquin 23 June 2006\nFenbuconazole 12 May 2006\nFenbutatin oxide 20 April 2007\nFenoxycarb 4 October 2007\nFluazifop-P 10 September 2007\nFlufenoxuron 8 November 2007\nFluometuron 31 August 2007\nFluquinconazole 22 December 2005\nFlurochloridone 27 October 2006\nFlutriafol 9 November 2006\nGuazatine 8 November 2007\nHexythiazox 18 May 2006\nHymexazol 8 October 2007\nIsoxaben 9 November 2006\nMetaldehyde 1 September 2006\nMetosulam 8 October 2007\nMyclobutanil 29 March 2006\nOryzalin 4 October 2007\nOxyfluorfen 4 October 2007\nPaclobutrazol 7 December 2006\nPencycuron 1 June 2006\nProchloraz 18 June 2007\nPropargite 8 October 2007\nPyridaben 7 August 2007\nQuinmerac 6 July 2007\nSintofen 8 November 2007\nTau-fluvalinate 18 June 2007\nTebufenozide 9 June 2006\nTefluthrin 4 May 2007\nTerbuthylazine 8 October 2007\nThiobencarb 21 July 2006"}
