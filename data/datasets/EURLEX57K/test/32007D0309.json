Decision 90/424/EEC, as amended by Decision 2006/53/EC\u00a0(2), provides for a Community financial contribution to Member States to cover certain costs involved in taking measures to eradicate avian influenza.\n(2) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in Hungary in 2006. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community\u2019s livestock population. Under Article 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, Hungary took measures to combat those outbreaks.\n(3) The payment of a Community financial contribution must be made subject to the condition that the planned measures were actually implemented and that the competent authorities provided all the necessary information to the Commission within certain deadlines.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC\u00a0(3), following the amendment of Decision 90/424/EEC by Decision 2006/53/EC, no longer covers avian influenza.
