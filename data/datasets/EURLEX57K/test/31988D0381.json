Production of chloromethanes by chlorination of methane (including high pressure chlor-alkali electrolysis) and from methanol   // 1,5 mg per litre of discharge   // 10 grams of carbon tetrachloride per tonne of total production capacity of chloromethanes   // 1 January 1988   // (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)   //   //    //   //  //   //   //   // 3.

They must ensure that all waters likely to be polluted are taken fully into account.\n(4) The average daily limit values are double the corresponding average monthly limit values shown in the table.\n(5) For measuring, analysis and sampling methods, see the recommendations of the International Commission of 3 June 1986.\n(6) It is not possible at this time to adopt limit values for this sector. The International Committee will propose such values to the Contracting Parties to the Convention at a later date. If necessary the limit values for other industrial sectors, such as establishments using carbon tetrachloride as a solvent, will be proposed by the International Commission at a later stage. In the meantime, the governments will fix emission standards for carbon tetrachloride autonomously in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention.\nThese standards must take account of the best technical means available and must not be less stringent than the nearest comparable limit value in Annex IV.\nThe provisions of this paragraph also apply where an industrial establishment engages in activities other than those for which the limit values are laid down in the above table which are likely to produce discharges of carbon tetrachloride.\nPursuant to Articles 14 and 19 of the Convention, these provisions will enter into force after their unanimous adoption by the Contracting Parties to the Convention.\nThe Contracting Parties will notify their adoption to the Government of the Swiss Confederation, which will acknowledge receipt of notification."}
