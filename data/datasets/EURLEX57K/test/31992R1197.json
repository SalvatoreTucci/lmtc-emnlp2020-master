The Member States shall conduct unannounced on-the-spot checks to verify the information given in cultivation contracts and declarations and in particular the area and variety cultivated. Such checks shall cover at least 5 % per variety or group of  varieties of the cultivation contracts and declarations registered in respect of each processing enterprise; contracts and declarations subject to checks must be representative of the quantities covered. Areas cultivated, excluding in particular the  area of service roads and enclosures, shall be verified, where necessary, by measuring.\n2. Where checks show that areas declared exceed areas cultivated by up to 10 %, the area to be used for the contract or declaration in question shall be that determined by the check. If the amount in excess is over 10 % or one hectare, the area to be  used for the contract or declaration in question shall be that determined by the check, less the declared area in excess, multiplied by two, except where the grower or processor has reported discrepancies in writing to the competent authorities before  the check was conducted.\n3. If checks cannot be conducted for reasons for which the grower is responsible, the area shall, except in cases in force majeure, be considered as not cultivated.\n4. The Member States shall take any further measures necessary for the application of this Regulation and in particular steps to prevent more than one cultivation contract or declaration being concluded or made in respect of one and the same area. The  Commission shall be informed of such measures.';\n2. the date '1 August' in the first and second indents of the first subparagraph and in the second subparagraph of Article 2b (5) is replaced by '20 June';\n3. point 12 of the Annex is replaced by the following:\n'12.
