However the determination of migration shall be restricted to  the food simulant(s) and to the condition(s) of test which, in the specific case under examination, may be considered to be the most severe on the basis of experience.\nCHAPTER I\nFood simulants\n1. General case: plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs of all types\nThe tests shall be carried out using the food simulants mentioned below, taking a fresh sample of the plastic material or article for each simulant:\n- distilled water or water of equivalent quality (= simulant A),\n- 3 % acetic acid (w/v) in aqueous solution (= simulant B),\n- 15 % ethanol (v/v) in aqueous solution (= simulant C),\n- rectified olive oil (1) (= simulant D); if for technical reasons connected with the method of analysis it is necessary to use different food simulants, olive oil shall be replaced by a mixture of synthetic triglycerides (2) or by sunflower oil. If all  the food simulants provided in this indent are inappropriate, other food simulants and conditions of time and temperature may be used.\nHowever, the simulant A shall be used only in the cases mentioned specifically in the Table of this Annex.\n2. Special case: plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with a single foodstuff or a specific group of foodstuffs\nThe tests shall be carried out:\n- using only the food simulant(s) specified as appropriate for the foodstuff or group of foodstuffs in the Directive 85/572/EEC (3),\n- where the foodstuff or group of foodstuffs is not included in the list referred to in the first indent, selecting the food simulant(s) prescribed in Section 1 which correspond most closely to the extractive capacity of the foodstuff or group of  foodstuffs.\nCHAPTER II\nTest conditions (times and temperatures)\n1. The migration tests are to be carried out, selecting from the times and temperatures specified in the table those which correspond most closely to, but are not less than, the normal or foreseeable conditions of contact for the plastic materials or  articles being studied.\n2. Where a material or article passes a test at a given time and temperature, it need not to be tested for a shorter time at the same temperature, nor for the same time at a lower temperature.\n3. However if a plastic material or article is intended for a food contact application covered by two or more combinations of time and temperature taken from the Table, migration will be determined by subjecting that material or article successively to  all the applicable test conditions, using the same aliquot of food simulant.\n4. If a plastic material or article is intended to come into contact with foodstuffs at any condition of time, the conditions for testing will be the following:\n(a) where the plastic material or article may in actual use be employed at any temperature up to and including 70 \u00b0C and that is indicated by an appropriate labelling or instructions, only the 10 day test(s) at 40 \u00b0C shall be carried out;\n(b) where a plastic material or article may in actual use be employed at a temperature above 70\u00b0 C:\n(i) where no labelling or instructions are given to indicate temperature expected in real use, simulants B and C shall be used at reflux temperature, if possible, or at two-hour test(s) at 100\u00b0 C and simulant D shall be used for two hours at 175\u00b0 C;\n(ii) where labelling or instructions are given to indicate conditions expected in real use, time and temperatures from the Table shall be selected.\n5. By derogation from the conditions provided in the table and in paragraph 2, if the plastic material or article may in actual use be employed for periods of less than 15 minutes at temperatures between 70\u00b0 C and 100\u00b0 C and that is indicated by an  appropriate labelling or instructions, only the two-hour test at 70\u00b0 C and the 10-day test at 40\u00b0 C shall be carried out. These tests shall be carried out separately taking different samples. For each of these two types of test, use a new sample of the  same material or article to be examined.\n6. If it is found that carrying out the tests under the conditions specified in the table causes physical or other changes in the plastic material or article which do not occur under normal of foreseeable conditions of use of that material or article,  the migration tests shall be carried out under conditions more appropriate to the specific case.\n7. For materials and articles intended for use in microwave ovens, migration testing shall use a conventional oven and appropriate time and temperature conditions selected from the Table.\nTable\n/* Tables: see OJ */\n(1) Characteristics of rectified olive oil: - iodine index (Wijs) = 80 to 88, - refraction index at 25 \u00b0C = 1,4665 to 1,4679, - acidity (expressed in % of oleic acid) = 0,5 % maximum, - peroxide index (expressed in milli-equivalents of oxygen  per kg of oil) = 10 maximum.\n(2) Characteristics of the standard synthetic triglycerides mixture as described in K.
