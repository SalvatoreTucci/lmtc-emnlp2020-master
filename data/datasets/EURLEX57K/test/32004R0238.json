If that benefit is combined with the benefit resulting from the invitations to tender for the reduction in the import duty, this is likely to disturb the Spanish market for cereals. Such combined benefits should therefore be ruled out.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
