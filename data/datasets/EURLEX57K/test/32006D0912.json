The results of that analysis show that certain Member States will not utilise their full allocation for 2006 while others will spend in excess of the allocated amount.\n(5) The Community\u2019s financial contribution to certain of those programmes therefore needs to be adjusted. It is appropriate to reallocate funding from programmes of Member States, which are not using their full allocation to those that are exceeding it. The reallocation should be based on the most recent information on the expenditure actually incurred by the concerned Member States.\n(6) Decisions 2005/723/EC and 2005/873/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I to V to Decision 2005/723/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "Decision 2005/873/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2)(d), \u2018EUR\u00a0105\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a00\u2019;\n2. in Article 1(2)(f), \u2018EUR\u00a0600\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a00\u2019;\n3. in Article 3(2)(a), \u2018EUR\u00a065\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0135\u00a0000\u2019;\n4. in Article 3(2)(b), \u2018EUR\u00a05\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a07\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n5. in Article 3(2)(e), \u2018EUR\u00a0240\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0370\u00a0000\u2019;\n6. in Article 4(2)(c), \u2018EUR\u00a050\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a090\u00a0000\u2019;\n7. in Article 4(2)(e), \u2018EUR\u00a0100\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0400\u00a0000\u2019;\n8. in Article 5(2)(f), \u2018EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a01\u00a0130\u00a0000\u2019;\n9. in Article 6(2)(a), \u2018EUR\u00a02\u00a0200\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a04\u00a0200\u00a0000\u2019;\n10. in Article 7(1)(a), \u2018EUR\u00a0650\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0550\u00a0000\u2019;\n11. in Article 7(1)(c), \u2018EUR\u00a0900\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0300\u00a0000\u2019;\n12. in Article 7(1)(k), \u2018EUR\u00a0488\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a038\u00a0000\u2019;\n13. in Article 8(2)(b), \u2018EUR\u00a0600\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a01\u00a0200\u00a0000\u2019;\n14. in Article 9(2)(a), \u2018EUR\u00a0160\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0260\u00a0000\u2019;\n15. in Article 11(2)(h), \u2018EUR\u00a025\u00a0760\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a026\u00a0065\u00a0000\u2019;\n16. in Article 11(2)(q), \u2018EUR\u00a05\u00a0515\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a05\u00a0550\u00a0000\u2019;\n17. in Article 11(2)(t), \u2018EUR\u00a02\u00a0205\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a02\u00a0665\u00a0000\u2019;\n18. in Article 12(2)(h), \u2018EUR\u00a0300\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0100\u00a0000\u2019;\n19. in Article 12(2)(p), \u2018EUR\u00a0685\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0335\u00a0000\u2019;\n20. in Article 13(2)(g), \u2018EUR\u00a012\u00a0790\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a04\u00a0790\u00a0000\u2019;\n21. in Article 13(2)(k), \u2018EUR\u00a05\u00a0215\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a02\u00a0815\u00a0000\u2019;\n22. in Article 13(2)(p), \u2018EUR\u00a0685\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0500\u00a0000\u2019;\n23. in Article 13(2)(r), \u2018EUR\u00a0865\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a075\u00a0000\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
