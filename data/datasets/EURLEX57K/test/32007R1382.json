Regulation (EC) No 1556/2006 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 774/94 opened, from 1 January 1994, new annual tariff quotas for certain pigmeat products. Those quotas are to apply for an unspecified period.\n(3) The tariff quotas should be administered on the basis of import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(5) should apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n(5) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, the quota period from 1 January to 31 December should be subdivided into a number of subperiods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(6) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in question in the pigmeat sector, precise conditions should be laid down as regards access for operators to the tariff quota scheme.\n(7) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down detailed rules for applying the import tariff quota for fresh, chilled or frozen pigmeat covered by CN codes 0203\u00a019\u00a013 and 0203\u00a029\u00a015 opened by Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 774/94.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quota shall be opened on an annual basis for the period from 1 January to 31 December.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quota referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable rate of customs duty and the serial number shall be as set out in Annex I.", "Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "The quantity fixed for the annual quota period shall be divided among four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June;\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, import licence applicants shall, when submitting their first application for a given quota period, furnish proof that they imported or exported, during each of the two periods referred to in that Article, at least 50 tonnes of products covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications must refer to the serial numbers indicated in Annex I to this Regulation.
