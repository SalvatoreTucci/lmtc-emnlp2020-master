Applying the various provisions regarding the grant of the derogation imposes a serious and complex administrative burden, particularly as regards checks and penalties. In the interests of sound administration, the date in question should thus be postponed to 31 July 2004.\n(2) In order to enable Member States to pay aid up to the end of a financial year, it is necessary to clarify the rules for taking into account expenditure validated for the period from 1 July to 15 October.\n(3) It is also important to specify that the penalties applicable to the financing of Member States' expenditure where they notify an area smaller than that indicated in the allocation for a given financial year may not be used in the context of the mechanism for making financial allocations during the financial year.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 571/2003(4), should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
