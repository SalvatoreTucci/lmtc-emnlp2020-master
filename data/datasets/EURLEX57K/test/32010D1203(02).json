Those schemes can benefit to enterprises and financial service providers through improved efficiency and automation of supply chains.\n(4) Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\u00a0(2) requires Member States, as of 1 January 2013, to adhere to the principle of equal treatment between paper and e-invoices.\n(5) The communication\u00a0(3) from the Commission entitled \u2018Reaping the benefits of electronic invoicing for Europe\u2019 proposes the establishment of a European multi-stakeholder forum to assist the Commission in coordinating actions at Member States level and identifying measures at Union level to facilitate the mass adoption of e-invoicing.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the field of e-invoicing and to define its tasks and its structure.\n(7) The group\u2019s main task will be to monitor the uptake of e-invoicing and to help to develop the e-invoicing market across the Member States. It should liaise with national multi-stakeholder fora and pay particular attention to cross border aspects of e-invoicing and the uptake of e-invoicing by small and medium-sized enterprises.\n(8) The European multi-stakeholder e-invoicing forum should be composed of members from national fora and representatives of European associations from the users\u2019 community, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party.\n(9) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the Forum should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom\u00a0(4).\n(10) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(5).\n(11) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision.
