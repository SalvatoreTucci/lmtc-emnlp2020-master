According to the same point, the versatility and intricate construction of the tippable flatbed prevent this article from being considered as a dumper covered by CN Code 8704\u00a010.\n(2) In its judgment in case C-396/02\u00a0(3) the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled that the fact that a flatbed vehicle is equipped with an intricate, versatile and precise tipping function does not exclude its classification as a dumper within the meaning of subheading 8704\u00a010 of the Combined Nomenclature.\n(3) Since the classification measure laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 396/92 is not in accordance with the said judgment of the Court, which found the point 4 to be incorrect, this Regulation should be amended insofar as it classifies hydraulically-tippable vehicles under CN code 8704\u00a031. Therefore it is appropriate to delete the point 4 and revoke it as from 10 March 1992.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Point 4 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) 396/92 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 March 1992.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.
