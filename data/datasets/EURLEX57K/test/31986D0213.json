The import licences for the raw sugar referred to in Article 1 shall be valid from the date of issue until 30 June 1986.\n2. The application for the licence referred to in paragraph 1 must be made to the competent authority in Portugal and must be accompanied by a declaration from a refiner in which he undertakes to refine the quantity of raw sugar concerned in Portugal within six months following the month in which the customs import formalities take place.\nIf the sugar in question is not refined within the prescribed time limit, the importer must pay an amount equal to the difference between the threshold price and the intervention price for raw sugar applicable on the day of acceptance of the import declaration concerned.\n3.
