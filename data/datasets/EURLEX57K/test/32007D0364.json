That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) for ornamental use should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled.\n(5) The competent authorities of certain Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.\n(6) The opinion adopted on 17 May 2006 (published 27 June 2006) by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), concluded, from all evidence provided, that cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) are unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use. EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the consent holder is in line with the intended use of the carnation.\n(7) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of EFSA, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use.\n(8) A unique identifier has been assigned to the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(2).\n(9) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended use with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.\n(10) Proposed labelling, on a label or in an accompanying document, should include wording to inform operators and final users that the cut flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38 can not be used for human or animal consumption nor for cultivation.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC, the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them, in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(3), the measures should be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Consent\nWritten consent shall be granted by the competent authority of the Netherlands to the placing on the market, in accordance with this Decision, of the product identified in Article 2, as notified by Florigene Ltd, Melbourne, Australia (Reference C/NL/04/02).\nThe consent shall, in accordance with Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions to which the consent is subject, which are set out in Articles 3 and 4.", "Product\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genetically modified organisms to be placed on the market as product, hereinafter \u2018the product\u2019, are cut flowers of carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.), with modified flower colour, derived from a Dianthus caryophyllus L. cell culture, and transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, strain AGL0, using the vector pcGP1470, and resulting in line 123.2.38.\nThe product contains the following DNA in three cassettes:\n(a) Cassette 1\n(b) Cassette 2\n(c) Cassette 3\nThis gene was used for in vitro selection.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent shall cover progeny derived through vegetative reproduction of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38).", "Conditions for placing on the market\nThe product may be put to ornamental use only, with the exception of cultivation, and may be placed on the market subject to the following conditions:\n(a) the period of validity of the consent shall be 10 years starting from the date on which the consent is issued;\n(b) the unique identifier of the product shall be FLO-4\u00d8644-4;\n(c) without prejudice to Article 25 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the methodology for detecting and identifying the product, including experimental data demonstrating the specificity of the methodology, as verified by the Community Reference Laboratory, shall be made available to the competent authorities and to inspection services of Member States as well as to the Community control laboratories.\n(d) without prejudice to Article 25 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the consent holder shall, whenever requested to do so, make positive and negative control samples of the product, or its genetic material, or reference materials available to the competent authorities and to inspection services of Member States as well as to the Community control laboratories;\n(e) the words \u2018This product is a genetically modified organism\u2019 or \u2018This product is a genetically modified carnation\u2019, and the words \u2018not for human or animal consumption nor for cultivation\u2019 shall appear either on a label or in a document accompanying the product.", "Monitoring\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the period of validity of the consent, the consent holder shall ensure that the monitoring plan, contained in the notification and consisting of a general surveillance plan to check for any adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from handling or use of the products, is put in place and implemented.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent holder shall directly inform the operators and users concerning the safety and general characteristics of the product and of the conditions as to monitoring, including the appropriate management measures to be taken in case of accidental cultivation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent holder shall submit to the Commission and to the competent authorities of the Member States annual reports on the results of the monitoring activities.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Article 20 of Directive 2001/18/EC the monitoring plan as notified shall be revised by the consent holder, where appropriate and subject to the agreement of the Commission and the competent authority of the Member State which received the original notification, and/or by the competent authority of the Member State which received the original notification, subject to the agreement of the Commission, in the light of the results of the monitoring activities.
