Pursuant to Decisions 2009/371/JHA and 2009/935/JHA, the list is set out in the Annex to Decision 2009/935/JHA.\n(3) It is for Europol's Management Board to review the list when necessary and to decide whether to propose to the Council amendments thereto.\n(4) In its meeting of 3-4 October 2012, Europol's Management Board decided to recommend to the Council that it add certain third States to the list, outlining the operational need to conclude cooperation agreements with those third States.\n(5) It is most important that Europol initiate the procedure for the conclusion of a cooperation agreement giving priority to Georgia, given the commitments in the framework of the Eastern Partnership established in 2009, the initialling in November 2013 of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Georgia, and the EU-Georgia Association agenda, as well as the EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Action Plan.\n(6) Decision 2009/935/JHA should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) On 19 December 2012, the Council decided to consult the European Parliament and, following that consultation, the European Parliament issued an opinion\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["In point 1 of the Annex to Decision 2009/935/JHA, the following entries are inserted:\n\u2014 Brazil\n\u2014 Georgia\n\u2014 Mexico\n\u2014 United Arab Emirates.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
