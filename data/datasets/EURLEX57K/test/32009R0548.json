In view of the current situation where the aid is fixed at zero, and the prior authorisation is no longer mandatory, the scope of Regulation (EC) No 760/2008 should be amended to lay down the conditions under which those rules are applicable\n(5) It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 760/2008 accordingly.\n(6) The proposed amendment should apply from 1 July 2009, the date on which the relevant amendments introduced by Regulation (EC) No 72/2009 apply.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 760/2008, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down the rules as regards the granting of authorisations for the use of casein and caseinates in the manufacture of cheese when:\n(a) an aid is fixed pursuant to Article 100 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007; and\n(b) such use is considered necessary for the manufacture of cheese as provided for in Article 119 of that Regulation.\nThose authorisations shall be granted for a period of 12 months, at the request of the undertakings concerned, subject to a prior undertaking in writing to accept and comply with the provisions of Article 3 of this Regulation.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 205, 1.8.2008, p. 22."}
