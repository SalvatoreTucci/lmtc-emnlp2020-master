Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should be limited.\n(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 fishing years.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be granted for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2004 in respect of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10\u00a0kg each.\nThe maximum allowance in accordance with the first and second indents of Article 27(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be fixed at EUR\u00a024 per tonne.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total quantities on which the compensatory allowance is payable shall be 26\u00a0353,548 tonnes of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10\u00a0kg each.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The allocation of the total quantity among the producer organisations concerned shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 17, 21.1.2000, p. 22.
