The Commission has published in the Official Journal of the European Union successive lists of bicycle assemblers\u00a0(6) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(2) Following the last publication of the list of parties under examination\u00a0(7), a main period of examination has been selected. This period runs from 1 January 2011 to 31 July 2011. Additional information from the years 2009 and 2010 was also requested. A questionnaire requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period was sent to all parties under examination.\n(3) The Commission was also informed of the liquidation of one company which was exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty on bicycle parts. Furthermore, one company informed the Commission that it had stopped its assembly operations.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nA.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceptable requests for exemption\n(4) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. These parties had already received their suspension with effect from the day of receipt by the Commission of a first complete request. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBlue Factory Team S.L.

Consequently, they fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(6) For this reason, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, the parties listed in table 1 above should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty.\n(7) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation, the exemption of the parties listed in table 1 above from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.\n(8) The company CODE X Sp. z o.o. changed its address during the examination procedure. The company received its suspension under the address ul. Krolewska 16, 00-103 Warszawa, Poland. During the suspension period the address changed to Olszanka 109, 33-386 Podegrodzie, Poland. This change of address does not affect the initial request for suspension or the decision on the exemption.\n(9) The company JETLANE SAS changed its name during the examination procedure. The company was initially suspended under its name JET\u2019LEAN SAS. During the suspension period the company changed its name to JETLANE SAS. This change of name does not affect the initial request for suspension or the decision on the exemption.\n(10) TARIC additional code A977 initially given to the company M\u00fcller GmbH was erroneously attributed twice and had to be withdrawn. On 3 June 2010 the company received TARIC additional code A978. This change of code does not affect the initial request for suspension or the decision on the exemption.\nA.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rejected requests for exemption\n(11) The party listed in table 2 below also submitted a request for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBikeworks AC GmbH Ernst-Abbe-Strasse 28, 52249 Eschweiler Germany A980\n(12) The party in question assembled bicycles as subcontractor and not in its own name. The company had no purchases of parts and it could not be evaluated if the assembly operations complied with the conditions set out in Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(13) On these grounds the Commission has to reject its request, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the exemption Regulation. Consequently, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty collected as from the date of receipt of the request for exemption submitted by this party, i.e. the date as of which the suspension took effect.\nA.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revocations\n(14) For the parties listed in table 3 below the exemption is to be revoked.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBicicletas de Alava SL C/Arcacha 1, 01006 Vitoria Spain 8963\nFundador-Sociedade Importadora de Sangalhos, Lda.

One party now informed the Commission services that it had stopped its assembly operations. Following an enquiry, the Commission services were informed by a Court in Portugal that the other party had been liquidated.

This party is not eligible for an exemption. For some parties the supply of parts for the production of bicycles covered by the measures according to Regulation (EC) No\u00a071/97 falls within the de minimis threshold of less than 300 units on a monthly basis as specified in Article 14(c) of the exemption Regulation. Consequently, those parties did not meet the conditions of Article 4.1(a) of the exemption Regulation and an exemption could not be granted. Some other parties had not started the production of bicycles yet and hence no suspension could be granted to them.\n(18) All companies listed in tables 1-4 above were informed and given the opportunity to comment.
