The coordinates for certain fisheries restrictive areas were inaccurately indicated in that Regulation and should be corrected.\n(5) Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 lays down the provisional catch limits for cod in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) zones VIIb-k, VIII, IX and X and in EC waters of CECAF area 34.1.1. Following a new scientific assessment of the state of that stock by the ICES, it is important to set the final total allowable catch for that stock.\n(6) Certain quotas and footnotes were inaccurately indicated in that Regulation for certain species and should be corrected.\n(7) Pursuant to consultations between the Community and Iceland on 10 April 2008, an arrangement was reached on capelin quotas for Icelandic vessels to be fished from the Community quota allocated under its Agreement with the Government of Denmark and the local Government of Greenland before 30 April 2008, and on redfish quotas for Community vessels fishing for redfish in the Icelandic Exclusive Economic Zone to be fished between July and December. That arrangement should be implemented in Community law.\n(8) The Agreement established between the European Community, the Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and the Russian Federation in Copenhagen on 13 and 14 February 2008 regarding the management of redfish in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters in the NEAFC Convention Area in 2008 should be implemented in Community law. As the Agreement is applicable for the whole of 2008, the measures adopted for its implementation should apply retroactively from 1 January 2008.\n(9) The conclusions of the EU-Greenland Joint Committee meeting in Nuuk on 27 November 2007 and the technical meeting in Copenhagen on 12 February 2008, as regards the EC share of redfish in Greenland waters of ICES zones V and XIV should be implemented in Community law. As the arrangement concluded with Greenland is connected to the NEAFC Agreement on management of redfish in the Irminger Sea, the measures adopted for the implementation of the conclusions of the EU-Greenland Joint Committee meeting should also apply retroactively from 1 January 2008.\n(10) In accordance with the Agreed Record of conclusions of fisheries consultations between the European Community and Norway of 26 November 2007, the Community is to undertake trials in 2008 on technical measures for towed gears to reduce the proportion, in number, of cod that is discarded to no more than 10\u00a0%. That arrangement should be implemented in Community law.\n(11) In order to ensure certainty for the fishermen concerned and to allow them to plan their activities for this fishing season as soon as possible, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in Title I, Article 3, of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 2015/2006 and (EC) No 40/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2015/2006\nPart 2 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2015/2006 is hereby amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008\nRegulation (EC) No 40/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
