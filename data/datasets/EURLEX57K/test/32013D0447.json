In this context, the standard capacity utilisation factor is necessary to determine the product-related activity level for products for which a product benchmark has been determined in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU. For new entrant installations, with the exception of new entrants due to a significant extension, this activity level is determined by multiplying the initial installed capacity for the production of this product in accordance with Article 17(4) of Decision 2011/278/EU with the standard capacity utilisation factor. For installations which had a significant capacity extension or reduction, Member States are to use the standard capacity utilisation factor to determine the product-related activity level of the added or reduced capacity of the subinstallation concerned.\n(3) The standard capacity utilisation factor should be the 80-percentile of the average annual capacity utilisation of all installations producing the product concerned. As part of the overall baseline data collection for incumbent installations carried out for the establishment of the National Implementation Measures (NIMs), Member States collected data on the average annual production of the product concerned in the period 2005-08. By dividing these production figures by the initial installed capacity as referred to in Article 7(3) of Decision 2011/278/EU, Member States then determined, on this basis, the capacity utilisation factors of the relevant installations on their territory. Member States then shared this information with the Commission as part of the NIMs.\n(4) Upon receipt of the NIMs from all Member States and taking into account the NIMs of the EEA-EFTA countries, the Commission determined the 80-percentile of the average annual capacity utilisation factors of installations producing a product for which a benchmark exists, taking into account the need to ensure neutral conditions of competition for industrial activities carried out in installations operated by a single operator and production in outsourced installations. The calculation is based on information available to the Commission up until 31 December 2012.\n(5) The standard capacity utilisation factors per product benchmark are set out in the Annex to this Decision. These factors apply for the years 2013 to 2020,", "main_body": ["The standard capacity utilisation factors listed in the Annex shall be used by Member States to determine the product-related activity level of installations referred to in Article 3(h) of Directive 2003/87/EC in accordance with Article 18 of Decision 2011/278/EU.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the first day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 September 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2011/278/EU of 27 April 2011 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonised free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 130, 17.5.2011, p. 1).\nANNEX\nProduct benchmark listed in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU Standard capacity utilisation factor (SCUF)\nCoke 0,960\nSintered ore 0,886\nHot metal 0,894\nPre-bake anode 0,928\nAluminium 0,964\nGrey cement clinker 0,831\nWhite cement clinker 0,787\nLime 0,813\nDolime 0,748\nSintered dolime 0,784\nFloat glass 0,946\nBottles and jars of colourless glass 0,883\nBottles and jars of coloured glass 0,912\nContinuous filament glass fibre products 0,892\nFacing bricks 0,809\nPavers 0,731\nRoof tiles 0,836\nSpray dried powder 0,802\nPlaster 0,801\nDried secondary gypsum 0,812\nShort fibre kraft pulp 0,808\nLong fibre kraft pulp 0,823\nSulphite pulp, thermo-mechanical and mechanical pulp 0,862\nRecovered paper pulp 0,887\nNewsprint 0,919\nUncoated fine paper 0,872\nCoated fine paper 0,883\nTissue 0,900\nTestliner and fluting 0,889\nUncoated carton board 0,863\nCoated carton board 0,868\nNitric acid 0,876\nAdipic acid 0,849\nVinyl chloride monomer (VCM) 0,842\nPhenol/acetone 0,870\nS-PVC 0,873\nE-PVC 0,834\nSoda ash 0,926\nRefinery products 0,902\nEAF carbon steel 0,798\nEAF high alloy steel 0,802\nIron casting 0,772\nMineral wool 0,851\nPlasterboard 0,843\nCarbon black 0,865\nAmmonia 0,888\nSteam cracking 0,872\nAromatics 0,902\nStyrene 0,879\nHydrogen 0,902\nSynthesis gas 0,902\nEthylene oxide/ethylene glycols 0,840"}
