In addition, Directive 2009/48/EC empowers the Commission to adopt specific limit values for chemicals used in toys which are intended for children under 36 months and in other toys intended to be placed in the mouth in order to ensure adequate protection in the case of toys involving a high degree of exposure. The adoption of such limit values takes the form of an inclusion in Appendix C to Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC.\n(2) For a number of chemicals, currently applicable limit values are either too high in the light of available scientific evidence or do not exist. Specific limit values should therefore be adopted for them, taking into account the packaging requirements for food as well as the differences between toys and food contact materials.\n(3) In order to advise the European Commission in the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives in the area of toy safety, the Commission established the Expert Group on Toys Safety. The mission of its subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 is to provide such advice with regard to chemical substances which may be used in toys.\n(4) 1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, BIT, CAS number 2634-33-5) is used as a preservative in water-based toys\u00a0(3) including hobby paints and finger paints\u00a0(4), as shown by the results of a market survey involving economic operators and their trade associations, consumer representatives and allergy centres as well as through internet searches and shop visits\u00a0(5).\n(5) In its deliberations about BIT the subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 took as a basis the related opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) noting that BIT is a well-documented contact allergen\u00a0(6). Although the opinion considers BIT as only a moderate sensitiser with a lower potency than other marketed cosmetic preservatives\u00a0(7), it concludes that isothiazolinones are important contact allergens for the consumer in Europe\u00a0(8). The use of BIT in cosmetics is not allowed\u00a0(9).\n(6) BIT is classified under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as a skin sensitiser. Directive 2009/48/EC has currently no specific limit value for BIT, nor a general limit value for sensitisers.\n(7) In the light of the above, the subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 considered that BIT should not be used in toys. In accordance with European Standard EN 71-9:2005+A1:2007, substances not to be used should be limited to the limit of quantification (LOQ) of an appropriate test method\u00a0(10). Accordingly the subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 recommended, at its meeting of 26 March 2014, that BIT in toys be limited to its LOQ, namely to a maximum concentration of 5 mg/kg. The use of BIT is not regulated for food contact materials.\n(8) In view of the above, Appendix C of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC should be amended to include a content limit for BIT in toys.\n(9) The content limit laid down by this Directive should be reviewed at the latest five years after the date on which Member States are to apply this Directive.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 47 of Directive 2009/48/EC,", "main_body": ["In Appendix C of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC, the following entry shall be added:\nSubstance CAS No Limit value\n\u20181,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one 2634-33-5 5 mg/kg (content limit) in aqueous toy materials, in accordance with the methods laid down in EN 71-10:2005 and EN 71-11:2005\u2019", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 24 May 2017 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
