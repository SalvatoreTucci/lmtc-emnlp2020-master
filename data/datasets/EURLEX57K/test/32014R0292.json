That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of 6-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 126897) as a feed additive for poultry and pigs to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinions of 11 September\u00a0(2) and 9 October 2013\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of 6-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 126897) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has a potential to improve the phosphorus utilisation, digestibility and bone mineralisation or the performance in chickens and turkeys for fattening. These conclusions can be extended to chickens reared for laying and turkeys reared for breeding. Since the mode of action of the additive can be considered similar in all poultry species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening or reared for laying or breeding. Furthermore, the Authority concluded that the additive has a potential to increase bone mineralisation, ileal digestibility, phosphorus utilisation and performance of the laying hens. These conclusions can be extrapolated to minor laying poultry species. The Authority also concluded that the additive has the potential to improve the phosphorus digestibility, phosphorus retention or the performance parameters in piglets, pigs for fattening and sows. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of 6-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 126897) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(10):3364.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(10):3433.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
