The SCAN concludes that the current maximum levels of these trace elements authorised in feedingstuffs are, in the majority of the cases, higher than necessary as regards the effects of these additives and recommends a reduction of such levels in order to adapt them to the physiological animal requirements.\n(6) In accordance with the current scientific and technical knowledge concerning specifically iron in feedingstuffs, suckling pigs must retain 7 to 16 mg/kg of iron daily, or 21 mg of iron kg/body weight gain to maintain adequate levels of haemoglobin. Sows' milk contains an average of only 1 mg of iron per litre. Thus, pigs receiving only milk rapidly develop anaemia. Iron should therefore be given to piglets in complementary feedingstuffs with a high content of this element as far as, during the suckling period, piglets are only fed with milk.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period of six months for the implementation of the new requirements and for a transitional period of nine months for the disposal of existing stocks of feedingstuffs labelled according to the previous conditions established in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The conditions for the authorisation of the additives E1 Iron-Fe, E3 Cobalt-Co, E4 Copper-Cu, E5 Manganese-Mn and E6 Zinc-Zn belonging to the group \"trace elements\"(8), are hereby replaced by those set out in the Annex hereto in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 26 January 2004. However, existing stocks of feedingstuffs labelled according to the previous conditions established in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC may be used during a transitional period expiring 26 April 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 265, 3.10.2002, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 289, 28.10.1998, p. 4.\n(4) OJ L 82, 26.3.1999, p. 6.\n(5) OJ L 284, 6.11.1999, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 299, 15.11.2001, p. 1.\n(7) OJ L 125, 21.5.2003, p. 3.\n(8) The list of authorised additives, including trace elements, is published in OJ C 329/1, 31.12.2002, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 871/2003 (L 123, 21.5.2003, p. 3).\nANNEX\n>TABLE>"}
