The following paragraph 12 shall be added to Article 2:\n'12 (a) Bottom set gillnets, entangling nets and trammel nets with mesh sizes that do not  correspond to any of the categories set out in Annexes VI or VII shall be prohibited and may not be  kept on board fishing vessels. In the case of trammel nets, the mesh size referred to in this  Regulation is that of the piece of net with the smallest mesh size.\n(b) When catches are made in regions 1 and/or 2 by fishing vessels using bottom gillnets,  entangling nets and/or trammel nets with mesh sizes corresponding to one of the categories set out  in Annex VI, the percentage of quantities retained on board expressed in live weight, for one or  any combination of species or groups of species mentioned in the corresponding mesh size category,  may not be less than 70 %.\n(c) When catches have been made in region 3 by fishing vessels using bottom set gillnets,  entangling nets and/or trammel nets with mesh sizes corresponding to one of the categories set out  in Annex VII, the percentage of quantities retained on board expressed in live weight, for one or  any combination of species or groups of species mentioned in the corresponding mesh size category,  may not be less than 70 %.\n(d) For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(i) \"bottom set gillnets or entangling nets\" are any gear made up of a single piece of net, fixed  by any means to the bottom;\n(ii) \"trammel nets\" are any gear made up of two or more pieces of net hung jointly in parallel on a  single headline, fixed by any means to the bottom of the sea.\n(e) Letters (a), (b), (c) and (d) shall not apply to catches of salmonidae and agnatha.'\n2.
