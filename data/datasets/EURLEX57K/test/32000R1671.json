In accordance with Article 47(2) thereof, Member States may reduce this amount to EUR 90 for travellers under 15 years of age.\n(5) Finland has requested a derogation from these values and has asked to apply a quantitative limitation for duty-free beer imports from third countries.\n(6) A limit of not less than 6 litres of beer seems appropriate, regard being had to the geographical situation of Finland and the economic difficulties of Finnish retailers located in the border regions and the considerable loss of revenue caused by the increased duty-free imports of beer from third countries.\n(7) It is necessary to set a time limit for this derogation in order to ensure that the equal treatment of travellers throughout the Community is ensured after a transitional period.\n(8) It is appropriate to maintain this derogation two years longer than the restriction for beer imported into Finland from other Member States, in order to allow the Finnish retail trade to adapt to the new situtation,", "main_body": ["The following Article shall be inserted in Regulation (EEC) No 918/83:\n\"Article 47b\nBy way of derogation from the values set out in Article 47, Finland shall be authorised until 31 December 2005 to apply a quantitative limit of not less than 6 litres for duty-free imports of beer.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 November 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 July 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
