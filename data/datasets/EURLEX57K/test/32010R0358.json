After having verified that those conditions have been met at airports in certain third countries and that those countries have a good record of cooperation with the Union and its Member States, the Commission has granted such exemptions.\n(3) As Regulation (EC) No 820/2008 is repealed from 29 April 2010 and thus those exemptions will also be repealed. However, the restrictions on liquids, aerosols and gels carried by passengers arriving on flights from third countries and transferring at Union airports remain in place as provided in Regulation (EU) No 297/2010 of 9 April 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 272/2009 supplementing the common basic standards on civil aviation security.\u00a0(3)\n(4) The exemptions to the application of the restrictions on liquids, aerosols and gels carried by passengers arriving on flights from third countries should therefore be extended whilst those restrictions remain in place, provided that those third countries continue to meet the conditions under which the exemptions were granted.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 of 4 March 2010 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security\u00a0(4) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Regulation (EU) No 297/2010 of 9 April 2010 will apply from 29 April 2010. The entry into force of this Regulation is therefore urgent as it should apply from the same date.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security set up by Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 29 April 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 97, 9.4.2008, p. 72.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 221, 19.8.2008, p. 8.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 90, 10.4.2010, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 55, 5.3.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\nThe Annex, Chapter 4 is amended as follows:\n1.
