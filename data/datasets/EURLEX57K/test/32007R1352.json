The adjustments introduced in Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 consisted in particular in the determination of the percentage of 2-glyceryl monopalmitate which is more precise for the detection of esterified oils, and the decreasing of the limit value for stigmastadiene in virgin olive oils which makes it possible to achieve a better separation of virgin and refined olive oils.\n(2) As a consequence, Additional note 2 to Chapter 15 of the Combined Nomenclature on olive oils should also be adjusted.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The amendment made to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 in 2007 is to be applied from 1 January 2008.
