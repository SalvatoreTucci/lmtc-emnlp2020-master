WAIGEL\nANNEX\nOBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION VIS-\u0102\u0080-VIS RWANDA  Priority must be given to the return of refugees. Reconciliation, broadening of the new government's bases and the creation of essential conditions for the return are vital. The Council  states its opinion that any aid should be disbursed progressively depending on the observed performance in these areas. International cooperation will have an important role to play in this process.\nObjectives and priorities for the European Union are:\n- to continue to provide humanitarian aid for the refugees,\n- to take short-term rehabilitation measures on a coordinated basis for Rwanda, especially in the most urgent fields of water and electricity, but also in education, health and housing, in order to create incentives for the return of refugees and for  their successful reintegration,\n- to resume progressively and under certain conditions development cooperation with Rwanda,\n- to initiate coherent measures for the repair of economic, ecological and social damages in those countries bordering Rwanda, which have been particularly struck by the refugee crisis.\nFor all the measures and programmes close coordination between the Commission and the Member States is necessary.\nThe European Union further deems it important to increase as early as possible the number of human rights observers in Rwanda and emphasizes the importance of a rapid total deployment of Unamir forces, in order to assure protection against acts of  revenge and persecution.\nThe European Union stresses the importance of bringing to justice those responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law, including genocide. In this respect the European Union considers the establishment of an international tribunal as an  essential element to stop a tradition of impunity and to prevent future violations of human rights.\nThe European Union underlines that within a long-term perspective such conflicts should be solved by Africa itself and recommends strengthening the OAU's capacities of preventing and solving regional conflicts.\nThe European Union also expresses its concern about the unstable political situation in Burundi, where acts of violence are increasing."}
