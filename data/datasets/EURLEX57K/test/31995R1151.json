whereas the rules of application for the quota year 1995/96 starting 1 July 1995 must be established;\nWhereas in accordance with Article 12 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 a similar method of administration should be applied as the one used in the past to corresponding quotas; whereas those arrangements consist of the allocation by the Commission of the quantities available partly to traditional operators and partly to operators engaging in trade in beef and veal;\nWhereas in order to ensure a smooth transition from the arrangements under the GATT quota of 53 000 tonnes the traditional importers should be allocated 80 % of the quota i. e. 42 400 tonnes on application and in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota in the years 1992, 1993 and 1994; whereas steps should be taken to ensure that operators of the new Member States can participate on equal terms in the allocations of the quantities available; whereas for those operators, therefore a part of the quantities of the products covered by the quota imported between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1994 into the new Member States from countries which were third countries for them on 31 December 1994 should be considered as reference quantities giving access to that part of the quota reserved for 'traditional` importers; whereas the choice of those years is dictated by the need to ensure their representativeness and to avoid consideration of any speculative imports; whereas the eligible reference quantities shall be determined by applying a coefficient corresponding to the Community level of traditional imports for GATT purposes compared to total imports of frozen beef;\nWhereas, on the basis of the submission of applications from interested parties and subject to their acceptance by the Commission operators who can demonstrate the genuine nature of their business and who apply for quantities of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota i. e. 10 600 tonnes; whereas the genuine nature of their business should be demonstrated through the presentation of proofs of a certain size of trade in beef and veal with countries which were third countries on 31 December 1994;\nWhereas verification of the abovementioned criteria requires that applications be submitted in the Member State in which the importer is entered into the value added tax register;\nWhereas operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 January 1995 should be barred access to the quota in order to prevent speculation;\nWhereas subject to the provisions of this Regulation Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (4), laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 340/95 (5) shall apply;\nWhereas in the framework of the implementation of the WTO agreement the detailed rules for the application of the system of import licences in the beef sector, presently provided for by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1084/94 (7), should be modified before 1 July 1995; whereas in order to prevent practical problems of application linked to the present tariff quota Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 should not apply; whereas special detailed rules on the import licences for that quota should be adopted instead;\nWhereas the effective management of this quota and in particular the prevention of fraud require that the licences used are returned to the competent authorities in order that they may verify that the quantities show therein are correct; whereas, to that end, an obligation should be imposed on the competent authorities to carry out such verification; whereas the amount of the security to be lodged on the issue of the licences should be fixed in such a way as to ensure that the licences are used and returned to the competent authorities;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1. A tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals falling within CN code 0202 and for products falling within CN code 0206 29 91, of 53 000 tonnes, expressed in weight of boneless meat, is hereby opened for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996.\nFor the purpose of counting against the said quota, 100 kilograms of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 77 kilograms of boneless meat.\n2.

For the purposes of applying paragraph 1 (b) the quantity of 10 600 tonnes shall be allocated to:\n(a) operators in the Community of the Twelve who can furnish proof of having:\n- imported at least 160 tonnes of beef in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1994 not subject to the quota referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 3392/92 and (EC) No 130/94, or\n- exported at least 300 tonnes of beef in the same period to third countries; and\n(b) operators in the new Member States who can furnish proof of having:\n- imported at least 160 tonnes of beef in the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1994 other than the quantities taken into consideration under paragraph 1 (a), or\n- exported at least 300 tonnes of beef to third countries in the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1994.\nFor this purpose 'beef` means products falling within CN codes 0201, 0202 and 0206 29 91, and the minimum reference quantities shall be expressed in terms of product weight.\n3. The 10 600 tonnes referred to in paragraph 2 shall be allocated in proportion to the quantities applied for by eligible operators.\n4. Proof of import and export shall be solely by means of customs documents of release for free circulation or export documents. However, with the Commission's authorization, the new Member States may, if appropriate, accept alternative forms of proof.\nMember States may accept duly certified copies of the abovementioned documents if the applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the competent authority the impossibility to obtain the original documents.", "1.

Before 7 June 1995 applications for import rights shall be submitted together with the proof referred to in Article 2 (4) to the competent authority in the Member State in which the applicant is entered into the value added tax register. Where an applicant under each of the arrangements referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) and Article 2 (1) (b) submits more than one application, all such applications shall be inadmissible.\nApplications pursuant to Article 2 (1) (b) shall relate to a quantity of no more than 50 tonnes of frozen meat expressed in product weight.\n2. After verification of the documents submitted, Member States shall forward to the Commission before 21 June 1995:\n- in respect of the arrangements pursuant to Article 2 (1) (a) a list of eligible importers containing in particular their names and addresses and the quantities of eligible meat imported during each reference year,\n- in respect of the arrangements pursuant to Article 2 (1) (b) a list of applicants containing in particular their names and addresses and the quantities applied for.", "1. The Commission shall decide as soon as possible to what extent applications may be accepted.\n2.
