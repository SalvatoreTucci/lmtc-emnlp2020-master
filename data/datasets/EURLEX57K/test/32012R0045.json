The Annex to that Regulation sets out the requirements for those elements.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides that, as from 31 December 2009, electronic identification is to be obligatory for all animals born after that date. However, the majority of animals born until that date are still only identified with non-electronic identifiers.\n(4) The individual animal code contained in the non-electronic identifiers can only be recorded manually. Manual recording of non-electronic identifiers requires considerable effort on the part of keepers and represents a potential source of errors.\n(5) The particular situation for animals born until 31 December 2009 was taken into account as regards the requirement to record individual animal codes in the movement document. The risks associated with movements of such animals to a slaughterhouse are limited and do not justify the supplementary administrative burden posed by that requirement. Animals moved directly to a slaughterhouse in the same Member State were therefore exempted from that requirement regardless of the date of movement of the animals.\n(6) In order to further reduce the administrative burden for operators, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/2008\u00a0(2), provides that the requirement of recording the individual animal code in the movement document is not obligatory for animals born until 31 December 2009, until 31 December 2011, for all movements other than to a slaughterhouse directly or via a channelling procedure.\n(7) During the time this transitional period has been in force, no major failures in the system have been reported to the Commission services as a result of the implementation of this derogation.\n(8) However, in some Member States, due to the particular way ovine and caprine animals are kept, data shows that animals born until 31 December 2009 will still form a substantial part of the ovine and caprine population until 31 December 2014. The risks associated with their movements would be constantly decreasing, proportionally to the decrease in the number of such animals. However, manual recording of non-electronic identifiers in those cases would still represent a substantial administrative burden on keepers of such animals.\n(9) Movements of such animals should therefore continue to be exempted from the requirement to record individual animal codes in the movement document until 31 December 2014. The burden imposed on keepers by such recording after that date, as well as the potential sources of error, would then be within acceptable levels.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) In the interest of legal certainty, it is appropriate that this Regulation apply retroactively from 1 January 2012, in order to ensure continuity in the application of the exemption from the requirement to record individual animal codes in the movement document.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Section C.3 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004, point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) until 31 December 2014 for all other movements.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 9.1.2004, p. 8.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 24.9.2008, p. 5."}
