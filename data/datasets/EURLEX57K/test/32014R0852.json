That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of L-methionine produced by Escherichia coli (KCCM 11252P and KCCM 11340P) as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 8 October 2013\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, L-methionine produced by Escherichia coli (KCCM 11252P and KCCM 11340P) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it may be considered efficacious source of the amino acid L-methionine for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that substance shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The Authority expressed in its opinion concerns over the safety of L-methionine for the target species when administered via water for drinking. However, no maximum content for L-methionine is proposed by the Authority. Thus, it is in the case of administration of L-methionine via drinking water appropriate to instruct the user to consider all different methionine sources in order to achieve an optimal supply with the essential amino acids without affecting the performance of the animals.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The substance specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018amino acids, their salts and analogues\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(10):3428.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
