Member States are to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with that Directive by 1 January 2010. However, that Directive did not provide that the Member States were to apply those provisions from that date.\n(3) For the sake of legal certainty, Directive 2008/73/EC should be corrected to ensure that the amendments made to the various Council acts by that Directive, in order to provide for those simplified procedures, are uniformly applied by the Member States from 1 January 2010. Directive 2008/73/EC should therefore be corrected so that it also applies from that date. Accordingly, that Directive should also be corrected in order to provide that the Member States are to apply those provisions from that date.\n(4) However, certain other amendments made by Directive 2008/73/EC to Directives 64/432/EEC\u00a0(3) and 90/426/EEC\u00a0(4) do not concern the simplified procedures and therefore they do not require the deferred date of application by the Member States of 1 January 2010. Those amendments concern respectively the adoption of specific animal health measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5) and correct an outdated reference.\n(5) In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new simplified procedures of listing and publishing information in the veterinary and zootechnical fields, it should be provided that transitional provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(6) To ensure legal certainty and continuity, this Decision should apply from 3 September 2008, the date of entry into force of Directive 2008/73/EC.\n(7) Directive 2008/73/EC should therefore be corrected accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 2008/73/EC is hereby corrected as follows:\n1. paragraph 2 of Article 20 shall be deleted;\n2. the following Articles shall be inserted:\n3.
