In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) Directive 93/32/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles as replaced by Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles\u00a0(5) and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of two-wheel motor vehicles as regards their passenger hand-holds. These technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to allow for the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(3) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the granting of EC component type-approval in respect of passenger hand-holds for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(4) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,", "main_body": ["This Directive shall apply to passenger hand-holds of all types of two-wheel motor vehicles as referred to in Article 1 of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "The procedure for the granting of EC component type-approval in respect of passenger hand-holds for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle and the conditions governing the free movement of such vehicles shall be as laid down in Chapters II and III of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "The amendments necessary to adapt to technical progress the requirements of Annex I shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2) of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall not, on grounds relating to passenger hand-holds:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of two-wheel vehicle or a type of passenger hand-hold, to grant EC type-approval,\n\u2014 prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of two-wheel motor vehicles or the sale or entry into service of passenger hand-holds,\nif the passenger hand-holds comply with the requirements of this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any type of two-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to passenger hand-holds or any type of passenger handhold, if the requirements of this Directive are not fulfilled.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.", "Directive 93/32/EEC, as amended by the Directive listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2010.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 July 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
