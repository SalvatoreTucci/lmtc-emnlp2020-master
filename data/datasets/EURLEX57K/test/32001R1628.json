Therefore, in the light of the data at present available, the maximum amount of the B levy for 2001/02 should be raised to 37,5 % of the intervention price for the white sugar concerned.\n(4) Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that, subject to Article 15(5) of that Regulation, the minimum price for B beet is fixed at EUR 32,42 per tonne.
