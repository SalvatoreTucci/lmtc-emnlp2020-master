The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from Yakult Europe BV, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of live Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota and maintenance of the upper respiratory tract defence against pathogens by maintaining immune defences (Question No EFSA-Q-2010-00137)\u00a0(2).

Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.\n(7) Following an application from Piimandus\u00fchistu E-Piim (Dairy Cooperative E-Piim), submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum TENSIATM in the semi-hard Edam-type \u2018heart cheese\u2019 of HarmonyTM and maintenance of normal blood pressure (Question No EFSA-Q-2010-00950)\u00a0(3).

As the Authority concluded that cause and effect relationships have not been established between the foods and the claimed effects, the claims do not comply with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and therefore they may not benefit from the transitional period provided for in that Article.\n(10) In order to ensure that this Regulation is fully complied with, both food business operators and the national competent authorities should take the necessary actions to ensure that, at the latest 6 months following the entry into force of this Regulation, products bearing the health claims listed in its Annex are no longer present on the market.\n(11) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The health claims listed in the Annex to this Regulation shall not be included in the Union list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, products bearing these health claims placed on the market or labelled prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation may remain on the market for a maximum period of 6 months after that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8(10):1860.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2011; 9(2):1981.\nANNEX\nRejected health claims\nApplication \u2013 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Live Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota Daily consumption of live Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota as present in a fermented milk product helps maintain the upper respiratory tract defences by helping to support immune functions Q-2010-00137\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Lactobacillus plantarum TENSIATM Regular consumption (at least three weeks) of 50\u00a0g/day S\u00fcdamejuust (\u2018heart cheese\u2019) of HarmonyTM brand comprising probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum TENSIATM helps to maintain the cardio-vascular system/heart health through reduction of blood pressure/symbol of heart Q-2010-00950"}
