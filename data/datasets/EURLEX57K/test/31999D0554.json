Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (Note:\nit is not required to implement such management schemes.)\nThese criteria aim in particular at promoting:\n- the reduction of discharges of certain toxic or otherwise polluting substances into waters,\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, ozone depletion, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption and related emissions to air,\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous chemicals,\n- the application of sustainable management principles in order to safeguard forests.\nThe criteria are set at levels which promote the labelling of paper made from recycled fibres or from virgin fibres or mixtures thereof, produced with technologies reflecting best environmental standards.\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n1. Emissions to water\nThe total discharges to water, after treatment (whether on-site or off-site), relating to the paper product shall be calculated as the sum of the discharges from the pulp and the paper production stages and shall not exceed:\n- 30 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) per tonne of paper produced.\nCOD shall be measured in accordance with ISO 6060 or equivalent standards,\n- 0,30 kg adsorbable organic halogens (AOX, as Cl) per tonne of paper produced. The amount of AOX (as Cl) discharged from each pulp manufacturing site shall not exceed 0,50 kg per air dry tonne of pulp.\nAOX shall be measured in accordance with ISO 9562, or equivalent standards. Measurement is not required where no chlorinated bleaching agents are used.\nData on water consumption per tonne of pulp and paper produced in the various stages of the production process shall be reported. (Note:\nthe data is necessary to evaluate the calculations of effluent loads and concentrations.)\n2. Emissions to air\nThe total emissions to air relating to the paper product shall be calculated as the sum of the emissions from the pulp and the paper production stages and shall not exceed:\n- 1,5 kg sulphur compounds (as S) per tonne of paper produced. The emissions related to the production of electricity need not be accounted for,\n- 3,0 kg nitrogen oxides (NOx, as NO2 equivalents) per tonne of paper produced. The emissions related to the production of electricity need not be accounted for,\n- 1500 kg carbon dioxide from non renewable sources per tonne of paper produced, including emissions from the production of electricity (whether on-site or off-site).\n3. Energy use\nThe total energy consumption relating to the paper product shall be calculated as the sum of the energy used in the pulp and the paper production stages and shall not exceed:\n- 26 G joule heat energy consumption per tonne of paper produced,\n- 7 G joule (1940 kWh) electricity per tonne of paper produced.\nThe applicant shall calculate all energy inputs, divided into heat/fuels and electricity used during the production of pulp and paper, including the energy used in the de-inking of waste papers for the production of recycled paper.\nTotal heat energy includes all purchased fuels, except fuels used for the internal generation of electricity. It also includes heat energy recovered by incinerating liquors and wastes from on-site processes (e.g. wood waste, sawdust, liquors, waste paper, paper broke), as well as heat recovered from the internal generation of electricity - however, the applicant need only count 80 % of the heat energy from such sources when calculating the total heat energy.\nElectric energy means net imported electricity coming from the grid and internal generation of electricity measured as electric power. Electricity used for waste water treatment need not be included.\n4. Fibres - Sustainable forest management\nFibres may be wood fibres, recycled fibres or fibres from other material.\nIn the case of virgin wood fibres from forests, the operators in charge of managing the sources from which the fibres originate shall implement principles and measures aimed at ensuring sustainable forest management. A declaration, charter, code of conduct, certificate or statement to this effect from these operators and/or from the pulp mills shall be presented.\nIn Europe, the principles and measures referred to above shall correspond to those of the Pan-European operational level guidelines for sustainable forest management, as endorsed by the Lisbon Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (2 to 4 June 1998). Outside Europe they shall correspond to the UNCED Forest Principles (Rio de Janeiro, June 1992) and, where applicable, to the criteria or guidelines for sustainable forest management as adopted under the respective international and regional initiatives (ITTO, Montreal Process, Tarapoto Process, UNEP/FAO Dry-Zone Africa Initiative).\n5. Dangerous chemical substances\nChlorine gas shall not be used as a bleaching agent. This requirement does not apply to chlorine gas related to the production and use of chlorine dioxide. (Note:\nwhile this requirement also applies to the bleaching of recycled fibres, it is accepted that the fibres in their previous lifecycle may have been bleached with chlorine gas.)\nChemical substances that are classified as dangerous for the environment and are assigned the risk phrases R50 and R53, according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC(1) as last amended by Commission Directive 98/98/EC(2), shall not be added in the production of paper by more than 0,1 % by weight of the paper.\n6. Waste management\nAll producers of pulp and copying paper shall have a system for the handling of waste(3) and residual products arising from the production plants. The system shall be documented or explained in the application and include information on at least the following points:\n- procedures for separating and using recyclable materials from the waste stream,\n- procedures for recovering materials for other uses, such as incineration for raising process steam, or agricultural use,\n- procedures for the handling of hazardous waste(4).\nFITNESS FOR USE\nThe product shall be fit for use.\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nThe product shall bear the following information on the primary and secondary package: \"This product qualifies for the Community eco-label because it meets requirements that, among others, limit emissions to water (COD, AOX), to air (S, NOx, CO2), energy use and the use of fossil fuels.\nPlease collect used paper for recycling.\"\nIn addition, the manufacturer may also provide a statement indicating the minimum percentage of recycled fibres.\n(1) OJ L 196, 16.8.1967, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 355, 30.12.1998, p. 1.\n(3) As defined by the relevant regulatory authorities of the pulp and paper production sites in question.\n(4) As defined by the relevant regulatory authorities of the pulp and paper production sites in question.\nTechnical appendix\nDEFINITIONS, TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND DOCUMENTATION\nAll emission parameters\nThe period for the measurements or mass balances shall be based on the production during 12 months. In case of a new or rebuilt production plant, the measurements shall be based on at least 45 subsequent days of stable running of the plant. The measurement shall be representative for the respective campaign.\nIf a product is made out of different pulp qualities, the emission values from the pulp production shall be calculated as weighted averages of all pulps used. The total emissions shall be calculated by adding the emissions from the pulp production to the emissions from the production of the copying paper.\nAccredited laboratories or independent test institutes following the standard EN 45001 shall carry out measurements. The laboratory of the pulp or paper manufacturer may, however, be approved for the analyses of discharges if any of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n- the relevant regulatory authorities accept the relevant sampling and measurements made in that laboratory or\n- the manufacturer has a quality system which includes sampling and analysis supervision and is certified according to ISO 9001 or ISO 9002 or\n- is an official GLP (good laboratory practice) approved laboratory.\nMeasurements of water emissions shall be taken on unfiltered and unsettled samples either after treatment at the plant or after treatment by a public treatment plant.\nAOX\nAOX shall be measured in processes where chlorine compounds are used for the bleaching of the pulp. This means that AOX need not be measured:\n- in the effluent from non-integrated paper production, or\n- in the effluents from pulp production without bleaching, or\n- where the bleaching is performed with chlorine-free substances.\nSulphur and nitrogen oxides\nThe applicant shall provide a balance on the air emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. This balance shall include all such emissions which occur during the production of pulp and paper, except those related to the production of electricity. Measurements shall include recovery boilers, lime kilns, steam boilers and destructor furnaces for strong smelling gases, if available. Diffuse emissions shall be accounted for.\nCarbon dioxide\nThe applicant shall provide a balance of the air emissions of carbon dioxide. This balance shall include all sources of non-renewable fuels during the production of pulp and paper, including the emissions from the production of electricity (whether on-site or off-site). The emission factors from Table 1 shall be used in the calculation of the CO2 emissions from fuels.\nTable 1\nEquivalents of CO2 from non renewable fuels\n>TABLE>\nFor grid electricity, the value quoted in the table shall be used for all sites within the European Union. For sites outside the European Union, the applicant may present documentation establishing the average value for their supplier(s) of electricity, and use this average value instead of the value quoted in the table.\nDangerous chemical compounds\nThe applicant shall present a declaration from each pulp supplier that chlorine gas has not been used for the bleaching of the pulps.\nThe applicant shall present a list of the chemical products used in the paper production. The list shall include the brand name of the product, the area of use and the name of the supplier. In addition to this list, a declaration with the following meaning shall be included: \"none of the substances classified as dangerous for the environment and assigned the risk phrases R50 and R53, according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC(1) as last amended by Commission Directive 98/98/EC(2), are added in the paper production process by more than 0,1 % by weight of the paper\". The production of pulp is not covered by this requirement.\nWaste management\nThe applicant shall provide a document describing the procedures for the handling of wastes and residual materials from the different stages of the pulp and paper production according to the requirements mentioned above.\nFitness for use\nThe applicant shall provide evidence to demonstrate that the product is fit for use.
