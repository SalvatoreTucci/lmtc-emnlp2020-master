officially approved or recognized, an organization or association which maintains stud-books, establishes sections of stud-books, and establishes stud-books for registered equidae must:\n1. have legal personality in accordance with the legislation in force in the Member State where the application is made;\n2. satisfy the competent authorities that it:\n(a) operates efficiently;\n(b) complies with the principles laid down in accordance with point 3 (b) of the Annex by the organization or association which maintains the stud-book of the origin of the breed, if it is not an organization or association which itself maintains that stud-book of the origin of the breed;\n(c) can carry out the checks necessary for recording predigrees;\n(d) has a sufficient number of equidae to carry out an improvement or selection programme or to preserve the breed where this is considered necessary;\n(e) can provide the data (on performance for instance) necessary to carry out an improvement, selection or preservation programme;\n3. have established principles:\n(a) the system for providing data (on performance for instance) whereby equidae can be evaluated for the purpose of improvement, selection and breed preservation;\n(b) in the case of an organization or association which maintains a stud-book of the origin of the breed:\n\u2014 the system for recording pedigrees,\n\u2014 the definition of the characteristics of the breed (or breeds) or the population covered by the stud-book,\n\u2014 the system for identifying equidae,\n\u2014 the definition of its basic objectives of selection,\n\u2014 the division of the stud-book, if there are different conditions for entering equidae, or if there are different procedures for classifying equidae entered in the book,\n\u2014 lineages entered in one or more other stud-books, where necessary;\n4. have rules of procedure which provide, in particular, for non-discriminatory treatment of breeders. However, in the event that for one breed in the territory of the Community there are several organizations or associations covering the whole of that territory, the rules of procedure of an organization or association may provide that equidae must be born in a given territory to qualify for entry for birth declaration purposes. This restriction does not apply to entry for reproduction purposes."}
