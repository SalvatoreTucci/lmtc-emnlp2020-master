That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus licheniformis (DSM 21564) as a feed additive for dairy cows to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 15 June 2012\u00a0(2) and 9 October 2013\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus licheniformis (DSM 21564) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. Furthermore, the Authority noted that during the first half of the lactation period the additive significantly increased milk yield. It considered that this conclusion cannot, however, be drawn for the whole lactation period. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus licheniformis (DSM 21564) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(7):2777.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(10):3434.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
