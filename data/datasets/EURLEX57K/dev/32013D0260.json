Ltd, Technology Industrial Park, Chengxin Road 223, Yongkang, China, imported into the EU by Bergner Europe GmbH, Am Seestern 18, 40547 D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\n(2) The reason for the measure given by the German authorities was the non-conformity of the chainsaw with the following essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC (with reference to the specifications of the relevant European harmonised standard EN ISO 11681-1):\n1.3.2. Risk of break-up during operation:\n1.7.4. Instructions:\n2.3 (c) Automatic brake:\n(3) The German authorities noted that, while the chainsaw bore the CE marking, it was not accompanied by an EC Declaration of conformity drawn up and signed by the manufacturer or his authorised representative as required by Article 5(1)(e) of Directive 2006/42/EC. They also noted that, while portable chainsaws are among the categories of machinery listed in Annex IV to the Directive to which one of the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 12(3) or (4) must be applied, proof had not been provided that the chainsaw of the type HV 0003 had undergone such a procedure.\n(4) The notification was accompanied by an inspection report established by the Deutsche Pr\u00fcf- und Zertifizierungsstelle f\u00fcr Land- und Forsttechnik GbR.\n(5) In accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11(3) of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Commission wrote to the manufacturer and the importer inviting them to comment on the measure taken by the German authorities.\n(6) No reply was received from the manufacturer. The importer informed the Commission that sale of the chainsaw had ceased and that he no longer imported this type of chainsaw.\n(7) Examination of the evidence provided by the German authorities confirms that the chainsaw of the type HV 0003 manufactured by Regal Tools Co. Ltd fails to comply with the essential health and safety requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC and that this non-conformity gives rise to serious risks of injury to users,", "main_body": ["The measure taken by the German authorities prohibiting the placing on the market of a chainsaw of the type HV 0003 manufactured by Regal Tools Co.
