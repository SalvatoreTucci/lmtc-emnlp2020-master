That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of the preparation specified in the Annex as feed additive for dogs and cats, to be classified in the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019 and the functional group \u2018flavourings compounds\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 24\u00a0May 2012\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, the additive specified in the Annex does not have any adverse effects on animal and human health, or the environment. The Authority concluded that since this smoke flavouring extract is used in food as smoke flavour, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary.\n(5) The Authority concluded that this additive is primarily defined by the manufacturing process and the mix of woods from which it derives, therefore the manufacturing process and the mix of woods need to be clearly specified in the annex to ensure that only smoke flavourings produced by such manufacturing method are placed on the market.\n(6) The Authority also concluded that no safety concerns would arise for users provided that appropriate protective measures are taken. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(7) The assessment of the preparation referred to in the Annex shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of preparations containing that smoke flavouring extract should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018flavourings compounds\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2729.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nCategory of sensory additives.
