As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law form the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and to take appropriate measures within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement. By annual letters, the latest one dated 23 February 2011, the European Union informed you of its decisions not to revoke the appropriate measures and to extend their period of application.\nSince its inception in 2009, progress achieved by the Government of National Unity based on the Global Political Agreement (GPA) has been welcomed by the European Union. The European Union reiterates the great importance it attaches to the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, and officially launched at the request of the Government of Zimbabwe at the EU-Zimbabwe Ministerial Troika on 18-19 June 2009 in Brussels. As agreed by both parties, the objective of this political dialogue is to progressively normalise EU-Zimbabwe relations along the implementation of the reforms foreseen in the GPA, paving the way for peaceful and credible elections.\nAs part of its overall re-engagement process, the European Union has taken steps towards easing measures applying to Zimbabwe. Appropriate measures were modified to allow support to institutions and processes related to the implementation of the GPA. The European Union has provided provisional transitional financial assistance in the form of short-term packages.\nSince then, the European Union has continued supporting the ongoing efforts of the Government of National Unity to implement the GPA, and has welcomed the achievements made in stabilising the economy and restoring basic social services. However, the European Union still awaits progress on several of the political reforms of the GPA, including the constitutional process and reforms needed to create a conducive environment for peaceful and credible elections, as well as progress in the areas of respect for human rights and the rule of law. In this context, the European Union welcomes the facilitation efforts led by the Republic of South Africa and the Southern African Development Community, and the establishment of a roadmap agreed by all parties.\nThe European Union welcomes recent statements made by all Zimbabwean parties against political violence, and remains hopeful that recent social and economic progress will be complemented by political reforms leading to peaceful and credible elections.\nTo further accompany the transitional process, the European Union has decided:\n\u2014 to extend its appropriate measures set out in Council Decisions 2002/148/EC and 2010/97/CFSP for a reduced period of 6 months, thereby reiterating the European Union's willingness to reconsider its position at any time following concrete steps in implementing the Global Political Agreement and in preparing for elections,\n\u2014 to prepare a Country Strategy Paper in the framework of the European Development Fund to be signed and implemented as soon as conditions allow.\nMeanwhile, the European Union will continue to provide transitional assistance to the economic recovery, social sectors and the implementation of the GPA.\nAll the other measures listed in the Annex to Council Decision 2002/148/EC shall continue to apply without changes. The Council Decision may, if circumstances change, be reviewed at any time prior to 20 August 2012.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union wishes to invite the Government of Zimbabwe to an intensified political dialogue under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement in order to define further steps towards normalisation of EU-Zimbabwe relations. Against this background, the European Union would welcome the visit of the Zimbabwe Re-engagement Committee to Brussels, which it hopes can be arranged for the near future.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\n\u2026\nFor the Council\n\u2026"}
