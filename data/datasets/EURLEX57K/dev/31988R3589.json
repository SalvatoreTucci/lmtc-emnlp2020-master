whereas, following the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community, an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters, was  concluded and approved by Decision 86/557/EEC (1);\nWhereas the said Agreement provides in particular for the opening of a Community tariff quota at zero duty for fillets of certain cod and of fish of the species Boreogadus saida, originating in Norway; whereas, therefore, the tariff quota in question  should be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1989;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all importers and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is used up; whereas, in the light of these principles, allocation of  the tariff quota among the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quota; whereas, in order to correspond as closely as possible to the actual development of the market in the said product, the allocation should reflect  proportionately the requirements of the Member States calculated with reference to statistics of imports from Norway during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota year in question;\nWhereas during the latest years for which statistics are available, imports into each of the Member States were as follows:\n(tonnes)      Member States 1984 1985 1986 1987 Benelux     0     0     1     0 Denmark    72    10     2    21 Germany     0     0     0     0 Greece     0    11     0     0 Spain    37     0     0    14 France    58     8    19    24 Ireland     0     0     0     0 Italy 4 589 2 691 2 354 1 390 Portugal     0     0     0     0 United Kingdom     0     0     0     0 4 756 2 720 2 376 1 449  Whereas, during the years under consideration, the products in question were imported only by certain Member States and not at all by the other Member States; whereas in these circumstances initial shares should be allocated to the importing Member  States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the tariff quota when imports into those States of the products concerned are notified; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common  Customs Tariff;\nWhereas, in view of these factors, the initial percentage shares of the quota volume can be expressed approximately as follows:\nDenmark0,50 Greece0,18 Spain0,21 France0,79 Italy98,32 Whereas, to allow for import trends for the products concerned, the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States  which have used up their initial share; whereas, to afford importers some degree of certainty, the first part of the tariff quota should be set at a high level, which in this case could be 54 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an  additional share from the reserve; whereas, each time its additional share is almost used up, a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end  of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must be able to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States  accordingly;\nWhereas if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused,\nit is essential that the Member State concerned return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve in order to prevent part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that  economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
