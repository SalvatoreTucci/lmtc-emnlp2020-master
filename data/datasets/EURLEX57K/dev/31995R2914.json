Initial estimates for 1996 suggest that growth in production will  continue to be slow,\n-  imports into the Community from all third countries are expected to rise by an average of 30-35   % in 1995 compared to 11,6 million tonnes in 1994, and to increase by a further 10  % in 1996,\n-  Community exports are estimated to decrease by 15-20  % in 1995 compared with 28,0 million  tonnes in 1994, and to fall by a further 6  % in 1996,\n-  the prices at which certain ECSC products have been imported into the Community are generally  substantially below those of Community products,\n-  there are similar trends in relation to certain steel products covered by the EC Treaty. In the  case of steel tubes and butt-welding fittings, Community production is expected to rise by 2  % in  1995 compared to 11,3 million tonnes in 1994, and to fall by 3  % in 1996; exports are expected to  fall by 5  % in 1995 compared to 5,3 million tonnes in 1994, and to fall by a further 3  % in 1996;  imports in 1995 are expected to increase by 25  % in 1995 compared to 4,4 million tonnes in 1994  (imports from certain third countries increasing in 1995 by between 36  % and 370  %) and,  according to initial estimates, will rise by a further 10  % in 1996; prices of products from  certain countries are 30-50  % below those of Community producers;\nWhereas, therefore, the trend in imports of certain ECSC and EC products originating in third  countries covered by this Regulation threatens to cause injury to Community producers and the  interests of the Community require that imports of these products should be subject to prior  Community surveillance in order to provide statistical information permitting rapid analysis of  import trends;\nWhereas the completion of the internal market requires that the formalities to be accomplished by  Community importers be identical wherever the goods may be cleared;\nWhereas release for free circulation of the products covered by this Regulation should be made  subject to presentation of a surveillance document meeting uniform criteria;\nWhereas that document should on simple application by the importer, be endorsed by the authorities  of the Member States within a certain period but without the importer thereby acquiring any right  to import; the document should therefore be valid only during such period as the import rules  remain unchanged;\nWhereas the surveillance documents issued for the purposes of Community surveillance must be valid  throughout the Community, regardless of the Member State of issue;\nWhereas the Member States and the Commission should exchange the information resulting from  Community surveillance as fully as possible;\nWhereas the issue of surveillance documents, while subject to standard conditions at Community  level, is to be the responsibility of the national authorities;\nWhereas it should be recalled that the import of certain iron and steel products from certain third  countries is subject not only to a surveillance document but also to an export document to be  granted in accordance with arrangements established within the framework of an agreement with those  third countries and the application of this Regulation is without prejudice to those arrangements,", "main_body": ["1.  From 1 January 1996, the release for free circulation in the  Community of iron and steel products covered by the ECSC and EC Treaties listed in Annex I,  originating in non-member countries other than the countries of the European Free Trade Association  (EFTA) or the countries which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA),  shall be subject to prior Community surveillance in accordance with Articles 11 and 12 of  Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 and Articles 9 and 10 of Regulation (EC) No 519/94.\n2.  The classification of the products covered by this Regulation is based on the tariff and  statistical nomenclature of the Community (hereinafter called the 'combined nomenclature`, or in  abbreviated form 'CN`). The origin of the products covered by this Regulation shall be determined  in accordance with the rules in force in the Community.", "1.  The release for free circulation of the products referred to in Article 1 in the  Community shall be subject to presentation of a surveillance document issued by the relevant  authorities of a Member State.\n2.  The surveillance document referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued automatically by the  competent authority in the Member States, without charge for any quantities requested, within five  working days of presentation of an application by any Community importer, wherever established in  the Community. This application shall be deemed to have been received by the competent national  authority no later than three working days after submission, unless it is proven otherwise.\n3.  A surveillance document issued by one of the authorities listed in Annex II shall be valid  throughout the Community.\n4.  The surveillance document shall be made out on a form corresponding to the model at Annex III.  The importer's application shall include the following elements:\n(a) the name and full address of the applicant (including telephone and telefax numbers, and  possible identification number used by the competent national authorities) and VAT registration  number, if subject to VAT;\n(b) if applicable, the name and full address of the declarant or representative of the applicant  (including telephone and telefax numbers);\n(c) the full name and address of the exporter;\n(d) the exact description of the goods, including -  their trade name,\n-  the combined nomenclature (CN) code(s),\n-  the country of origin,\n-  the country of consignment;\n(e) the net weight, expressed in kg and also quantity in the unit prescribed where other than net  weight, by combined nomenclature heading;\n(f) the cif value of the goods in ECU at the Community frontier by combined nomenclature heading;\n(g) whether the products concerned are seconds or of substandard quality  (1);\n(h) the proposed period and place of customs clearance;\n(i) whether the application is a repeat of a previous application concerning the same contract;\n(j) the following declaration, dated and signed by the applicant with the transcription of his name  in capital letters:\n'I, the undersigned, certify that the information provided in this application is true and given in  good faith, and that I am established in the Community`.\nThe importer shall also submit a copy of the contract of sale or purchase, the pro forma invoice  and/or, in cases where the goods are not directly purchased in the country of production, a  certificate of production issued by the producing steel mill.\n5.  Surveillance documents may be used only for such time as arrangements for liberalization of  imports remain in force in respect of the transactions concerned. Without prejudice to possible  changes in the import regulations in force or decisions taken in the framework of an agreement or  the management of a quota:\n-  the period of validity of the surveillance document is hereby fixed at four months,\n-  unused or partly used surveillance documents may be renewed for an equal period.", "1.  A finding that the unit price at which the transaction is effected exceeds that  indicated in the surveillance document by less than 5  % or that the total value or quantity of the  products presented for import exceeds the value or quantity given in the surveillance document by  less than 5  % shall not preclude the release for free circulation of the products in question.\n2.  Applications for surveillance documents and the documents themselves shall be confidential.  They shall be restricted to the competent authorities and the applicant.", "1.  Within the first 10 days of each month, the Member States shall communicate to the  Commission:\n(a)  details of the quantities and values (calculated in ecus) for which surveillance documents  were issued during the preceding month;\n(b)  details of imports during the month preceding the month referred to in subparagraph (a).\nThe information provided by Member States shall be broken down by product, CN code and by country.  It shall be communicated electronically in the form agreed for this purpose.\n2.  The Member States shall give notification of any anomalies or cases of fraud which they  discover and, where relevant, the basis on which they have refused to grant a surveillance  document.", "Any notices to be given hereunder shall be given to the Commission of the European  Communities (DGI/D/2 and DG III/C/2).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official  Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall apply from 1 January to 31 December 1996.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 1995.\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President\nANNEX I\nPRIOR SURVEILLANCE 1996\n>TABLE>\nANEXO II - BILAG II - ANHANG II - \u00d0\u00c1\u00d1\u00c1\u00d1\u00d4\u00c7\u00cc\u00c1 \u00c9\u00c9 - ANNEX II - ANNEXE II - ALLEGATO II -  BIJLAGE II - ANEXO II - LIITE II - BILAGA II\nLISTA DE LAS AUTORIDADES NACIONALES COMPETENTES\nLISTE OVER KOMPETENTE NATIONALE MYNDIGHEDER\nLISTE DER ZUSTAENDIGEN BEHOERDEN DER MITGLIEDSTAATEN\nAE\u00c9AA\u00d5\u00c8\u00d5\u00cd\u00d3AA\u00c9\u00d3 \u00d4\u00d9\u00cd \u00c1\u00d1\u00d7\u00d9\u00cd AA\u00caAE\u00cf\u00d3\u00c7\u00d3 \u00c1AEAA\u00c9\u00d9\u00cd \u00d4\u00d9\u00cd \u00ca\u00d1\u00c1\u00d4\u00d9\u00cd \u00ccAA\u00cb\u00d9\u00cd\nLIST OF THE COMPETENT NATIONAL  AUTHORITIES\nLISTE DES AUTORIT\u00c9S NATIONALES COMP\u00c9TENTES\nELENCO DELLE COMPETENTI AUTORIT\u00c0  NAZIONALI\nLIJST VAN BEVOEGDE NATIONALE INSTANTIES\nLISTA DAS AUTORIDADES NACIONAIS COMPETENTES\nLUETTELO TOIMIVALTAISISTA KANSALLISISTA VIRANOMAISISTA\nLISTA OEVER KOMPETENTA NATIONELLA  MYNDIGHETER\nBELGIQUE/BELGI\u00cb\nMinist\u00e8re des affaires \u00e9conomiques\nAdministration des relations \u00e9conomiques\nQuatri\u00e8me division: Mise en oeuvre des politiques commerciales internationales - Services des  licences\nRue G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Leman 60\nB-1040 Bruxelles\nT\u00e9l\u00e9copieur: (32  2)  230  83  22\nMinisterie van Economische Zaken\nBestuur van de Economische Betrekkingen\nVierde Afdeling: Toepassing van het Internationaal Handelsbeleid - Dienst Vergunningen\nGeneraal Lemanstraat 60\nB-1040 Brussel\nFax: (32  2)  230  83  22\nDANMARK\nErhvervfremme Styrelsen\nSoendergade 25\nDK-8600 Silkeborg\nFax: (45)  87  20  40  77\nDEUTSCHLAND\nBundesamt fuer Wirtschaft, Dienst 01\nPostfach 5171\nD-65762 Eschborn 1\nFax: 49  (61  96)  40  42  12\nAA\u00cb\u00cb\u00c1AE\u00c1\n\u00d5\u00f0\u00ef\u00f5\u00f1\u00e3aass\u00ef AA\u00e8\u00ed\u00e9\u00ea\u00de\u00f2 \u00cf\u00e9\u00ea\u00ef\u00ed\u00ef\u00ecss\u00e1\u00f2\n\u00c3aa\u00ed\u00e9\u00ea\u00de \u00c3\u00f1\u00e1\u00ec\u00ec\u00e1\u00f4aass\u00e1 AE.\u00cf.\u00d3\nAE\u00e9aa\u00fd\u00e8\u00f5\u00ed\u00f3\u00e7 AE\u00e9\u00e1ae\u00e9\u00ea\u00e1\u00f3\u00e9\u00fe\u00ed AA\u00ee\u00f9\u00f4aa\u00f1\u00e9\u00ea\u00ef\u00fd\nAA\u00ec\u00f0\u00ef\u00f1ss\u00ef\u00f5\n\u00ca\u00ef\u00f1\u00edUE\u00f1\u00ef\u00f5 1\nGR-105  63 \u00c1\u00e8\u00de\u00ed\u00e1\n\u00d4\u00dd\u00ebaaoe\u00e1\u00ee: (301)328  60  29/328  60  59/328  60  39\nESPA\u00d1A\nMinisterio de Comercio y Turismo\nDirecci\u00f3n General de Comercio Exterior\nPaseo de la Castellana 162\nE-28046 Madrid\nFax: (341) 563  18  23/349  38  31\nFRANCE\nSERIBE\n3-5, rue Barbet-de-Jouy\nF-75357 Paris 07 SP\nT\u00e9l\u00e9copieur: (33  1) 43  19  43  69\nIRELAND\nLicensing Unit\nDepartment of Tourism and Trade\nKildare Street\nIRL-Dublin 2\nFax: (353  1) 676  61  54\nITALIA\nMinistero per il Commercio estero\nD.G.
