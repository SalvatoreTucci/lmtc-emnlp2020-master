This Directive shall apply to the labelling of the materials used in the main components of  footwear for sale to the consumer.\nFor the purposes of this Directive, 'footwear' shall mean all articles with applied soles designed  to protect or cover the foot, including parts marketed separately as referred to in Annex I.\nA non-exhaustive list of the products covered by the Directive appears in Annex II.\nThe following shall be excluded from the Directive:\n- second-hand, worn footwear,\n- protective footwear covered by Directive 89/686/EEC (5),\n- footwear covered by Directive 76/769/EEC (6),\n- toy footwear.\n2. Information on the composition of footwear shall be conveyed by means of labelling as specified  in Article 4.\n(i) The labelling shall convey information relating to the three parts of the footwear as defined  in Annex I, namely:\n(a) the upper;\n(b) the lining and sock; and (c) the outersole.\n(ii) The composition of the footwear shall be indicated as specified in Article 4 on the basis  either of pictograms or of written indications for specific materials, as stipulated in Annex I.\n(iii) In the case of the upper, classification of the materials shall be determined on the basis of  the provisions contained in Article 4 (1) and in Annex I, no account being taken of accessories or  reinforcements such as ankle patches, edging, ornamentation, buckles, tabs, eyelet stays or similar  attachments.\n(iv) In the case of the outersole, classification shall be based on the volume of the materials  contained therein, in accordance with Article 4.", "1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all footwear placed on the market  meets the labelling requirements of this Directive without prejudice to other relevant Community  provisions.\n2. Where footwear not in conformity with the provisions regarding labelling requirements is placed  on the market, the competent Member State shall take appropriate action as specified in its  national legislation.", "Without prejudice to other relevant Community provisions, Member States shall not prohibit or  impede the placing on the market of footwear which complies with the labelling requirements of this  Directive, by the application of unharmonized national provisions governing the labelling of  certain types of footwear or of footwear in general.", "1.

If no one material accounts for at  least 80 %, information should be given on the two main materials used in the composition of the  footwear.\n2. The information shall be conveyed on the footwear. The manufacturer or his authorized agent  established in the Community may choose either pictograms or written indications in at least the  language or languages which may be determined by the Member State of consumption in accordance with  the Treaty, as defined and illustrated in Annex I. Member States, in their national provisions  shall ensure that consumers are adequately informed of the meaning of these pictograms, while  ensuring that such provisions do not create trade barriers.\n3.

It must not be possible for the labelling to mislead the consumer.\n5.

Definition and corresponding pictograms of the materials\nThe pictograms concerning the  materials should appear on the label beside the pictograms relating to the 3 parts of the footwear  as specified in Article 4 and in part 1 of this Annex.\nPictogram Written indications (a) (i) Leather A general term for hide or skin with its original fibrous structure more or less intact, tanned to  be rot-proof. The hair or wool may or may not have been removed. Leather is also made from a hide  or skin which has been split into layers or segmented either before or after tanning. However, if  the tanned hide or skin is disintegrated mechanically and/or chemically into fibrous particles,  small pieces or powders and then, with or without the combination of a binding agent, is made into  sheets or other forms, such sheets or forms are not leather. If the leather has a surface coating,  however applied, or a glued-on finish, such surface layers must not be thicker than 0,15 mm. Thus,  all leathers are covered without prejudice to other legal obligations, e.g. the Washington  Convention.\nShould the term 'full grain leather' be used in the optional additional textual information  referred to in Article 5, it will apply to a leather bearing the original grain surface as exposed  by removal of the epidermis and with none of the surface removed by buffing, snuffing or  splitting.\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nF Cuir D Leder IT Cuoio NL Leder EN Leather DK Laeder GR AEAA\u00d1\u00cc\u00c1 ES Cuero P Couros e peles curtidas Pictograms Written indications (a) (ii) Coated Leather leather where the surface coating applied to the leather does not exceed one third of the total  thickness of the product but is in excess of 0,15 mm.\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nF Cuir enduit D Beschichtetes Leder IT Cuoio rivestito NL Gecoat leder EN Coated leather DK Overtrukket laeder GR AA\u00d0AA\u00cdAEAAAE\u00d5\u00ccAA\u00cd\u00cf AEAA\u00d1\u00cc\u00c1 ES Cuero untado P Couro revestido (b) Natural textile materials and synthetic or non-woven textile materials 'Textiles' shall mean all products covered by Directive 71/307/EEC and amendments thereof.\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nF Textile D Textil IT Tessili NL Textiel EN Textile DK Tekstil-materialer GR \u00d5OE\u00c1\u00d3\u00cc\u00c1 ES Textil P T\u00e9xteis (c) All other materials >REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nF Autres mat\u00e9riaux D Sonstiges Material IT Altre materie NL Overige materialen EN Other materials DK Andre materialer GR \u00c1\u00cb\u00cb\u00c1 \u00d5\u00cb\u00c9\u00ca\u00c1 ES Otros materiales P Outros materiais\nANNEX II\nEXAMPLES OF FOOTWEAR COVERED BY THIS DIRECTIVE\n'Footwear' may range from  sandals with uppers consisting simply of adjustable laces or ribbons to thigh boots the uppers of  which cover the leg and thigh.
