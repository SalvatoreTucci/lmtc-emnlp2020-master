Article 29(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006\u00a0(6) should be updated accordingly.\n(2) Article 30(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 provides that applicants in the second part of the quota have to prove that they have been engaged in trade with third countries. It appears that this condition can be interpreted in different ways. It should therefore be clarified by specifying that trade with third countries has to be proven by presentation of the relevant customs documents.\n(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 provides for a security of EUR 15 per 100 kilograms. With a view on harmonisation and simplification it is appropriate to align it to the general level, as provided for in Article 10 of that Regulation, which is also applicable for the management of the cheese quota referred to in Section 2 of Chapter III of that Regulation.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) It should be provided for that the amended provisions should not apply on licences that have been issued already.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
