Those criteria should ensure a high level of environmental protection. They should be without prejudice to the classification of glass cullet as waste by third countries.\n(2) Reports of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission have shown that a market and demand exist for glass cullet to be used as feedstock in the glass producing industry. Glass cullet should therefore be sufficiently pure and meet the relevant standards or specifications required by the glass producing industry.\n(3) The criteria determining when glass cullet cease to be waste should ensure that cullet resulting from a recovery operation meet the technical requirements of the glass producing industry, comply with existing legislation and standards applicable to products and do not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts. Reports of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission have shown that the proposed criteria on the waste used as input in the recovery operation, on the treatment processes and techniques, as well as on the glass cullet resulting from the recovery operation fulfil those objectives as they should result in the generation of cullet devoid of hazardous properties and sufficiently free of non-glass components.\n(4) In order to ensure compliance with the criteria, it is appropriate to provide that information on glass cullet which has ceased to be waste is issued and that a management system is implemented.\n(5) In order to allow operators to adapt to the criteria determining when glass cullet ceases to be waste, it is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period to elapse before this Regulation applies.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes criteria determining when glass cullet destined for the production of glass substances or objects in re-melting processes ceases to be waste.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Directive 2008/98/EC shall apply.\nIn addition, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018glass cullet\u2019 means cullet generated from the recovery of waste glass;\n(2) \u2018holder\u2019 means the natural or legal person who is in possession of glass cullet;\n(3) \u2018producer\u2019 means the holder who transfers glass cullet to another holder for the first time as glass cullet which has ceased to be waste;\n(4) \u2018importer\u2019 means any natural or legal person established within the Union who introduces glass cullet which has ceased to be waste into the customs territory of the Union;\n(5) \u2018qualified staff\u2019 means staff which is qualified by experience or training to monitor and assess the properties of glass cullet;\n(6) \u2018visual inspection\u2019 means inspection of glass cullet covering all parts of a consignment and using human senses or any non-specialised equipment;\n(7) \u2018consignment\u2019 means a batch of glass cullet which is intended for delivery from a producer to another holder and may be contained in either one or several transport units, such as containers.", "Criteria for glass cullet\nGlass cullet shall cease to be waste where, upon transfer from the producer to another holder, all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(1) the cullet resulting from the recovery operation complies with the criteria set out in Section 1 of Annex I;\n(2) the waste used as input for the recovery operation complies with the criteria set out in Section 2 of Annex I;\n(3) the waste used as input for the recovery operation has been treated in accordance with the criteria set out in Section 3 of Annex I;\n(4) the producer has satisfied the requirements set out in Articles 4 and 5;\n(5) the glass cullet is destined for the production of glass substances or objects in re-melting processes.", "Statement of conformity\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The producer or the importer shall issue, for each consignment of glass cullet, a statement of conformity conforming to the model set out in Annex II.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The producer or the importer shall transmit the statement of conformity to the next holder of the glass cullet consignment.
