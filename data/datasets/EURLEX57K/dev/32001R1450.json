That Regulation acknowledges that, in the case of the outermost regions, adjustments and derogations may be envisaged to meet the specific needs of those regions.\n(2) Article 299(2) of the Treaty recognises, moreover, the constraints affecting the outermost regions, which include the Canary Islands.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92(5) seeks to remedy the handicaps due to the remote and insular nature of these regions.\n(4) The structures of certain agricultural holdings or processing and marketing enterprises located in these islands show serious shortcomings and are beset with specific difficulties. Provision should accordingly be made for derogations for certain types of investments from the provisions limiting or preventing the grant of some structural aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.\n(5) The Community financial contribution for three of the accompanying measures referred to in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 may amount in the outermost regions to up to 85 % of the total eligible cost. On the other hand, in accordance with the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the Community financial contribution for agri-environmental measures, which constitutes the fourth accompanying measure, shall be limited to 75 % for all areas covered by Objective 1. In view of the importance attributed to agri-environment within the context of rural development, the rate of the Community financial contribution should be harmonised for all accompanying measures in the outermost regions.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(6), each plan, Community support framework, operational programme and single programming document shall cover a period of seven years, and the programming period shall begin on 1 January 2000.
