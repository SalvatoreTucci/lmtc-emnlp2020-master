Floods in certain Community regions have affected sheltering and supplies of fodder and have made producers vulnerable to heavy losses of income by compelling them to sell their livestock if the normal feed cannot be provided. Temporary alternatives should therefore be offered by authorising the use of land set aside under the arable-crop scheme in duly justified cases having regard to objective criteria and on condition that at least 33 % of the forage area of the holding in question has been flooded, provision nonetheless being made for measures to ensure that the land is not used for any lucrative purpose.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.

The national authorities shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the land set aside is not used for any lucrative purpose and shall in particular make sure that the products harvested on the land in question are excluded from the aid scheme for dried fodder provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 603/95(5).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 9 August 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 August 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 280, 30.10.1999, p. 43.\n(4) OJ L 51, 22.2.2002, p. 14.\n(5) OJ L 63, 21.3.1995, p. 1.\nANNEX\nDEUTSCHLAND\nNiedersachsen (gesamtes Gebiet)\nSachsen-Anhalt (Landkreise: Stendal, Salzwedel, Ohrekreis, B\u00f6rdekreis, Halberstadt, Wernigerode, Quedlinburg, Wittenberg, Jerichower Land, Anhalt-Zerbst, K\u00f6then, Bitterfeld, Bernburg)\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern (Landkreise: Ludwigslust, Parchim, Nordwest Mecklenburg, G\u00fcstrow, Demmin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz)\nSchleswig-Holstein (gesamtes Gebiet)\nBrandenburg (gesamtes Gebiet)\nSachsen (gesamtes Gebiet)\nBayern (Regierungsbezirke: Oberbayern, Schwaben, Niederbayern; Landkreise: Regensburg, Cham, Schwandorf)\nUNITED KINGDOM\nScotland\nNorthern Ireland\nEngland:\n- Counties: Avon, Durham, Humberside, North Yorkshire, Somerset, West Yorkshire, Wiltshire\nIRELAND\n\u00d6STERREICH\nNieder\u00f6sterreich (gesamtes Bundesland)\nOber\u00f6sterreich (gesamtes Bundesland)\nSalzburg (Politische Bezirke: Flachgau, Hallein)"}
