Therefore, the evaluation and selection of sites at Community level was done using the best available information at present.\n(8) The Member State concerned has not proposed sufficient sites to meet the requirements of Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species. For those habitat types and species it can therefore not be concluded that the network is complete. Taking into account the delay in receiving the information and reaching agreement with the Member State, it is necessary to adopt an initial list of sites, which will need to be revised in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(9) Given that knowledge on the existence and distribution of some of the natural habitat types of Annex I and species of Annex II to Directive 92/43/EEC remains incomplete, it should not be concluded that the network is either complete or incomplete. The initial list should be revised, if necessary, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Habitats Committee,", "main_body": ["The initial list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 92/43/EEC is set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0206, 22.7.1992, p.\u00a07.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0107, 24.4.1997, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nInitial list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region\nEach site of Community importance (SCI) is identified by the information supplied in the Natura 2000 format, including the corresponding map.
