Commission Regulation (EC) No 982/2002 of 7 June 2002 laying down the marketing standards for cultivated mushrooms\u00a0(2) has been amended several times. For sake of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 982/2002 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(2) To that end, and in the interest of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the UN/ECE standard FFV-24 concerning marketing and quality control of cultivated mushrooms recommended by the Working Party on Agricultural Quality Standards of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).\n(3) Application of the new standards should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve profitability.\n(4) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause some degree of deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch.\n(5) As products in the \u2018Extra\u2019 class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged, only lack of freshness and turgidity should be taken into account in their case.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The marketing standard applicable to cultivated mushrooms falling within CN code 0709\u00a051\u00a000 shall be as set out in the Annex.\nThe standards shall apply to all marketing stages under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\nHowever, at stages following dispatch, products may show, in relation to the requirements of the standard:\n(a) a slight lack of freshness and turgidity;\n(b) for products graded in classes other than the \u2018Extra\u2019 class, slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish.", "Regulation (EC) No 982/2002 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.

Psalliota), to be supplied fresh to the consumer, mushrooms for industrial processing being excluded.\nMushrooms are classified into the following commercial types, whereas these first of all are classified into two groups:\n\u2014 uncut mushrooms, which have the lower part of the stalk uncut,\n\u2014 cut mushrooms, which have the lower part of the stalk cut.\nIn both groups a distinction is made between successive stages of development:\n\u2014 closed mushrooms (or equivalent denomination), i.e. mushrooms with the cap completely closed,\n\u2014 veiled mushrooms, i.e. mushrooms the cap of which is connected to the stalk by the veil,\n\u2014 open mushrooms, i.e. mushrooms with an open cap (open cap or flat; a slight downturn of the edges of the cap is required),\n\u2014 flat mushrooms, i.e. mushrooms which are fully open (but the edges of the cap are neither too cupped nor inverted).\nMushrooms are further classified into two colour groups:\n\u2014 \u2018white\u2019,\n\u2014 \u2018brown\u2019 or \u2018chestnut\u2019.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of mushrooms after preparation and packaging.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the mushrooms must be:\n\u2014 intact, in the case of cut mushrooms the cut must be clean,\n\u2014 sound, produce affected by rotting, severe browning in the stalk or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n\u2014 clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter, other than casing material,\n\u2014 fresh in appearance, account should be taken of the typical gill colour of the strain and/or commercial type,\n\u2014 practically free from pests,\n\u2014 practically free from damage caused by pests,\n\u2014 free of abnormal external moisture,\n\u2014 free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe development and condition of the mushrooms must be such as to enable them:\n\u2014 to withstand transport and handling, and\n\u2014 to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Classification\nThe mushrooms are classified in three classes defined below:\n(i) \u2018Extra\u2019 Class\n(ii) Class I\n\u2014 slight defect in shape,\n\u2014 slight defect in colouring,\n\u2014 slight superficial bruising,\n\u2014 slight traces of casing material;
