Commission Decision 93/13/EEC of 22 December 1992 laying down the procedures for veterinary checks at the Community border inspection posts on products from third countries(3), as last amended by Decision 2003/279/EC(4), was adopted an the basis of the first directive and should therefore be updated.\n(3) The certificate issued after completion of veterinary checks and currently laid down in Annex B to Decision 93/13/EEC should be adapted to take account of changes to procedures both for consignments meeting Community rules and for consignments not meeting Community rules, and whether for import into or transit of the Community.\n(4) Detailed rules concerning the use of that certificate are set out in Commission Decision 2000/208/EC of 24 February 2000 establishing detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 97/98/EC concerning the transit of products of animal origin from one third country to another third country by road only across the European Community(5), and Commission Decision 2000/571/EC of 8 September 2000 laying down the methods of veterinary checks for products from third countries destined for introduction into free zones, free warehouses, customs warehouses or operators supplying cross border means of sea transport(6).\n(5) However, it is necessary to lay down specific rules regarding the practical management of the certificate in situations where consignments receive veterinary clearance at the border inspection post but remain under customs supervision for fiscal reasons for some time. In such cases a system of traceability, and clarification as to the documentation to accompany the consignment, are required.\n(6) For the proper functioning of the system of veterinary checks in the single market all the information pertaining to a product should be brought together in a single document with a uniform design to reduce problems of differences of language in different Member States.\n(7) Specific details of harmonised sampling and laboratory testing of different types of product will be made the subject of later implementing decisions, but in the meantime national rules should continue to apply except in the case of particular safeguard measures.\n(8) Experience has shown that it is of fundamental importance to have good sources of information regarding all consignments entering the Community to reduce fraud and evasion of checks. Checking of manifests is a key feature of this information-gathering process but is a very substantial and time-consuming task that should be automated by electronic means wherever possible.\n(9) In addition to the efficient gathering of the pertinent information among all the appropriate operators, the competent authority should be allowed to have access to the relevant databases of the customs authorities. All the operators should be integrated to this system of databases to ensure the availability of updated information by those involved.\n(10) Certain plant products posing a risk of spreading infectious or contagious diseases to animals should be subjected to veterinary checks. A list of such products should be drawn up together with a list of third countries or parts of third countries which may be authorised to export those products to the Community.\n(11) For small amounts of products of animal origin being carried for their personal consumption by passengers arriving from third countries, exemptions from the requirements of veterinary checks procedures are possible. Certain of those products are the subject of a safeguard measure in accordance with Commission Decision 2002/995/EC of 9 December 2002 laying down interim safeguard measures with regard to imports of products of animal origin for personal consumption(7). Reference to those measures should be retained pending the adoption of permanent rules in this sector.\n(12) The measures in this Regulation replace those laid down in Decision 93/13/EEC and that decision should therefore be repealed.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Veterinary checks\n1. The documentary checks provided for in Article 4(3) of Directive 97/78/EC shall be carried out in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.\n2.

For each consignment, the competent authority must ascertain the intended customs approved treatment or use to which the goods will be assigned.\n2. Each certificate or document for animal health or public health which accompanies a consignment of products originating in a third country and presented to the border inspection post must be inspected in order to confirm as appropriate:\n(a) that it is an original certificate or document;\n(b) that it refers to a third country or part of a third country authorised to export to the Community, or, for non-harmonised products, to the Member State concerned;\n(c) that its presentation and content correspond to the model drawn up for the product and third country concerned, or, for non-harmonised products, to the Member State concerned;\n(d) that it meets the general principles of certification laid down in Annex IV to Council Directive 2002/99/EC(1);\n(e) that it has been fully completed;\n(f) that it relates to an establishment or vessel authorised or registered to export to the Community, or, for non-harmonised products, to the Member State concerned;\n(g) that it is signed by the official veterinarian or, where appropriate, the representative of the official authority, and shows legibly and in capitals his/her name and position, and also that the official health stamp of the third country and official signature are in a different colour to that of the printing of the certificate, or, for electronic certificates, signature and stamp are made by a secure system;\n(h) that part 1 of the CVED is correctly completed and that the information in it corresponds with information in other relevant official documents accompanying the consignment.\n(1) OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\nANNEX II\nTHE LABORATORY CHECKS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 1(2)\nThe following rules are to be applied to the laboratory testing of products:\n1. Member States must submit consignments of products presented for importation to a monitoring plan, with the objective to monitor conformity with Community legislation or, where applicable, national rules, and in particular to detect residues, pathogenic organisms or other substances dangerous to humans, animals or the environment. These monitoring plans must be based upon the nature of the products and the risk they represent, taking into account all relevant monitoring parameters such as frequency and number of incoming consignments and results of previous monitoring.\n2. Where random tests are carried out under monitoring plans referred to in paragraph 1, and no immediate danger to public or animal health is suspected, the consignment tested may be released for free circulation before the laboratory results are obtained. In all cases the CVED accompanying the consignment must be annotated accordingly and the competent authority at the place of destination notified in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 97/78/EC.\n3. Where the laboratory tests are carried out on the basis of suspicion of irregularity, available intelligence, a previous notification from the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) or a safeguard measure, and when testing concerns a substance or a pathogenic agent which presents a direct or immediate animal or public health risk, the official veterinarian responsible for the border inspection post who carried out the test or the competent authority must withhold the consignment from veterinary clearance and release until satisfactory results of the laboratory tests are received. In the meantime the consignment shall remain under the control of the authorities and under the responsibility of the official veterinarian or designated official agent in the border inspection post that has carried out the veterinary controls.\n4. Each Member State shall inform the Commission monthly of favourable and unfavourable results of laboratory testing that has been carried out in its border inspection posts.\nANNEX III\nTHE COMMON VETERINARY ENTRY DOCUMENT (CVED)\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004021EN.001701.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004021EN.001801.TIF\">\nNotes for guidance for the CVED certificate(1)\nGeneral:\nComplete the certificate in capitals.
