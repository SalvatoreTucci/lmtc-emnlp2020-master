whereas those areas are listed in Annex III to that Regulation and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86 (4); whereas Article 5 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the possibility of the premium being granted to producers keeping females of the ovine species of certain mountain breeds other than ewes which are eligible for the premium in certain areas; whereas those ewes and areas are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1970/87 (6);\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the loss of income represents, per 100 kilograms of carcase weight, any difference there may be between the basic price and the arithmetic mean of the market prices recorded for each region;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the amount of the premium payable per ewe and per region is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in paragraph 2 by a coefficient representing, for each region, the normal average annual production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase weight; whereas, however, for region 5, that loss of income must be reduced by the weighted average of the variable premiums actually granted for the 1987 marketing year, such average being obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of that Article; whereas Article 5 (3) also fixes the amount of the premium payable per female of the caprine species at 80 % of the premium per ewe; whereas, pursuant to Article 5 (9), the amount of the premium per female of the ovine species, other than a ewe which is eligible for the premium, is also fixed at 80 % of the premium per ewe;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 9a of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 the amount of the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in Article 9a (2); whereas that coefficient was corrected by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 980/89 of 14 April 1989 on the definitive application of the guarantee limitation arrangements for sheepmeat and goatmeat for the 1988 marketing year (7);\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3168/88 (8) authorizes the Member States to pay an advance to producers located in less-favoured agricultural areas; whereas such an advance was paid during the 1988 marketing year to the producers in question;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 4 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3007/84 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1514/86 (10), the Member States in region 1 are not authorized to make a payment on account of the premium referred to in Article 5 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80; whereas, however, in view of the current quite exceptional situation on the markets in region 1, Greece and Italy have been authorized, by way of derogation from Article 4 (4), to make a payment on account of the said premium;\nWhereas the French Government has decided to come to the assistance of farmers whose holdings are located in areas which are not less favoured; whereas, to that end, the French Government has contemplated making an advance to them also, but out of national funds, of an amount corresponding to 50 % of the ewe premium which such farmers may claim at the end of the marketing year;\nWhereas the French Government has notified the Commission of that planned national aid in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the Treaty;\nWhereas the Council decided by decision of 26 September 1988 to regard the national aid in the form of a payment on account of the premium for ewes, granted by the French Government to French sheepmeat producers whose holdings are located in areas of France which are not less favoured, as being compatible with the common market, up to a rate of 50 % of the estimated premium and until the end of the 1988 marketing year;\nWhereas the premium payable per eligible animal is paid only if the amount fixed per ewe is one ecu or more;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1873/80, the amount of the definitive premium and the balance to be paid in less-favoured agricultural areas should be fixed;\nWhereas the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The loss of income recorded for the 1988 marketing year for the regions listed below is as follows:\n1.2 // Region   // Difference in ecus per 100 kg   // 2  // 102,453   // 3   // 86,893   // 4   // 119,806   // 5  // 58,703   // 6   // 102,961   // 7   // 93,602", "1.
