(2) OJ No L 307, 18.11.1980, p. 5. (3) OJ No C 187, 28.7.1981, p. 2.  Member States are no longer empowered to introduce national aid measures unilaterally;\nWhereas, in view of the foregoing, the economic reasons put forward by the French Government cannot be accepted;\nWhereas the prohibition laid down in Article 92 (1) cannot be lifted under paragraph 2 of that Article since the derogations it provides for are obviously not applicable in this case;\nWhereas the derogations provided for in Article 92 (3) must, in the context of national or regional aids, be given a strict interpretation ; whereas, in particular, there should be derogations only where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary in order to attain one of the objectives specified in those provisions;\nWhereas to authorize, under the said derogations, aids which do not feature such a compensating element would be tantamount to allowing trade between Member States to be undermined and to accepting distortions of competition which would not be in the Community interest and, by the same token, unjustified advantages for certain Member States;\nWhereas it is not possible to establish that such a compensating element exists in the case of the planned aid in question;\nWhereas the French Government has been unable to give, and the Commission to find, grounds for considering that the aid in question meets the requirements for a derogation under Article 92 (3) of the Treaty;\nWhereas the measure is not intended to promote the economic development of an area where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious under-employment and it is not an important project of common European interest or a measure to remedy a serious disturbance in France's economy ; whereas, therefore, paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 92 (3) of the Treaty are not applicable in this case;\nWhereas, moreover, the measure constitutes an operating aid for the producers concerned which is purely of an interim protective nature ; whereas the Commission has always opposed aids of this type which do not meet the conditions for a derogation under Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty since they are highly ineffective and therefore unlikely to promote development as laid down therein;\nWhereas, in view of the foregoing, the abovementioned aid does not meet the requirements for application of a derogation under Article 92 (3) of the Treaty,", "main_body": ["The aid granted by France in the form of a payment of FF 146 million to the equalization funds in the pigmeat sector is incompatible with the provisions of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "France shall inform the Commission, within one month, of the measures taken to comply with the provisions referred to in Article 1.", "This decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 November 1982.\nFor the Commission\nPoul DALSAGER\nMember of the Commission"}
