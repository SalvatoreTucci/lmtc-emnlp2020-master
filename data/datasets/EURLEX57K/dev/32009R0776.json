However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 924/2008\u00a0(3) has fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar at 650\u00a0000 tonnes in respect of marketing year 2008/2009. Applications submitted for export licences for out-of-quota sugar have reached the quantity made available by that Regulation.\n(4) The fact that the fixed quantitative limit was reached 3 months prior to the end of the 2008/2009 marketing year indicates significant interest for exporting out-of-quota sugar by Community producers of sugar. In order to ensure that Community producers of sugar can continue to supply their established traditional markets as well as make use of new market opportunities it is appropriate to increase the quantitative limit fixed for exports of out-of-quota sugar in respect of marketing year 2008/2009. On the basis of the applications submitted so far and the need to extend to 3 months the validity of the export licences it can be estimated that an increase by 300\u00a0000 tonnes should be sufficient to permit a continued trade flow for Community exports of out-of-quota sugar.\n(5) According to Article 8a of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 export licences issued for out-of-quota sugar exports are valid from the actual day of issue until 30 September of the marketing year in respect of which the export licence was issued. However, such a limitation would lead to major difficulties for exporters and unnecessary interruption of sugar trade towards the end of the marketing year. It is therefore appropriate to allow for exports to take place beyond 30 September 2009 by fixing the validity of the export licences at 3 months.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 924/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 924/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.
