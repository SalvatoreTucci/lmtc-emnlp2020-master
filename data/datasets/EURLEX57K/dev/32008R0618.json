The quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation should therefore be imported before 30 June 2008. However, due to the late decision of this reallocation and account being taken of the time allowed for applying for import licences, it will be impossible to respect this deadline. Therefore Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 should also apply to the quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The delivery obligations for imports originating in the countries that are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India in respect of products falling within CN code 1701, expressed in tonnes of white-sugar equivalent, in the 2007/2008 delivery period for each exporting country concerned, are hereby adjusted as shown in the Annex.", "By way of derogation from Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, Article 14(1) of that Regulation shall apply to the quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation and imported after 30 June 2008.", "Regulation (EC) No 77/2008 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
