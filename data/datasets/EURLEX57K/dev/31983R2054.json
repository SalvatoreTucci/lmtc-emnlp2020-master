another serving for comparison of actual values with required values and capable of providing experiment feedback control);\n7. a power supply;\n8. a line printer for data output;\n9. a floppy-disk unit for additional data and programme storage;\nWhereas the Common Customs Tariff annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 604/83 (3), lists under heading No 85.22 electrical appliances and apparatus, having individual functions, not falling within any other heading of Chapter 85, and under heading No 90.28 electrical measuring, checking, analyzing or automatically controlling instruments, and apparatus;\nWhereas both these headings must be taken into consideration in classifying the aforementioned instruments;\nWhereas, pursuant to Note 5 (a) to Chapter 90, heading No 90.28 includes instruments or apparatus for measuring or checking electrical quantities;\nWhereas the instrument in question compares data previously converted into electrical quantities with pre-programmed standard data; whereas comparison of a detected electrical quantity with a standard electrical quantity constitutes a measuring operation;\nWhereas Section XVI, which includes heading No 85.22, does not cover articles falling within Chapter 90;\nWhereas the aforementioned instruments cannot, therefore, fall within heading No 85.22 but must be classified under heading No 90.28 and, by virtue of Additional Note 2 to Chapter 90, under subheading 90.28 A II a);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature,", "main_body": ["Electronic instruments (called multi-channel analyzers) which, because they incorporate microprocessors, can classify results previously obtained with external measuring apparatus such as voltmeters, sensors, or angular decoders and received by the instruments in the form of electrical signals, and can compare these results (actual values) with the required values, and which consist essentially of the following parts:\n1. a control panel with keys and control knobs;\n2, a visual display unit with a cathode-ray tube and control knobs to enable signal-evaluation results to be presented in the form of spectral lines or alphanumeric data;\n3. analogue-to-digital converters for the conversion of analogue-input signals into digital signals;\n4. electronic amplifiers for signal enhancement;\n5. a data storage unit for data and programmes;\n6. three microprocessors for data processing (one of which works with programmed calibration data;
