The aim of such surveillance would be to detect the possible presence of TSEs in cervids. Accordingly, provision should be made for Member States to carry out surveys in line with that opinion.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs in animals. That Regulation, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1923/2006 lays down provision for monitoring programmes for TSEs in cervids. Accordingly, it is now possible to provide for surveys for TSEs in cervids to be carried out by Member States in this Decision.\n(4) Those surveys should include wild and farmed deer species. Since wild deer should primarily be sampled during the hunting season which is of limited duration, in order to allow Member States sufficient time to achieve target numbers of samples, this Decision should therefore apply following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1923/2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.\n(5) Member States should submit an annual report of the results of those surveys on cervids. The detection of a positive finding of TSE in cervids must be immediately reported to the Commission.\n(6) Member States should ensure that cervids tested for TSEs do not enter the commercial food chain until a negative result has been obtained.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Decision lays down rules for a survey to detect the presence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in animals of the deer family, namely cervids (the survey).", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision the definitions set out in Annex I shall apply.", "Scope of the survey\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall carry out a survey to detect the presence of CWD in cervids in accordance with the minimum requirements in Annex II.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall complete their survey no later than the end of the 2007 hunting season.", "Measures to be taken by Member States following testing for CWD\nMember States shall carry out the measures set out in Annex III following testing for CWD.", "Reports to be provided to the Commission by the Member States\nMember States shall submit to the Commission the following reports:\n(a) a report immediately following the discovery of a positive or inconclusive finding for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in a cervid;\n(b) an annual report of the results of surveys as set out in Annex IV.", "Summary of reports by the Commission to the Member States\nThe Commission shall present to the Member States a summary of the reports provided for in Article 5.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.

At least a portion of each sample shall be kept fresh or frozen until a negative result is obtained, in case bioassay is required.\nThe competent authority of the Member States must refer to point 3 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation EC (No) 999/2001 for guidance on methods and protocols.\nRapid tests as referred to in point 4 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation EC (No) 999/2001 used for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) detection in obex of bovine or small ruminant animals shall be considered suitable for use in the sampling referred to in points 1 and 2 of this Annex. Member States may also use immunohistochemistry for screening purposes for which purpose they shall satisfy a proficiency test by the Community Reference Laboratory. Where a Member State is unable to confirm a positive rapid test result, they shall send adequate tissue to the CRL for confirmation. In the case of positive findings of TSE, the protocol as provided for in point 3.2, (c)(i) and (ii), Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation EC (No) 999/2001 shall apply.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Genotyping\nThe prion protein genotype shall be determined for each positive finding of TSE in cervids in accordance with the guidelines of the Community Reference Laboratory for TSEs.\nANNEX III\nMeasures following testing of cervids\n1. Where a cervid intended to be placed on the market for human consumption has been selected for testing for CWD, the Member States shall ensure the traceability of that carcase and ensure that it is not released for commercial sale until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained.\n2. Insofar as possible, and whenever point 1 applies, the hunter, gamekeeper or farmer, where known, shall be informed when samples are submitted for testing for CWD and the results of a positive rapid test communicated as soon as possible by authorised means.\n3. The Member States shall reserve the right to retain material for further diagnostic or research purposes until a negative result to the rapid test for CWD has been obtained.\n4. Insofar as possible, except for the material to be retained for further diagnostic or research purposes, all parts of the body of a cervid found positive to the rapid test, including the hide, shall be directly disposed of in accordance with Articles 4(2)(a), (b) or (e) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002\u00a0(1).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 273, 10.10.2002, p. 1.\nANNEX IV\nReporting and recording requirements\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requirements of Member States:\nInformation to be presented by Member States in their annual report on the survey results for CWD\n(a) The number of cervid samples submitted for testing, by target group according to the following criteria:\n\u2014 species,\n\u2014 farmed or wild cervids,\n\u2014 target group,\n\u2014 sex,\n\u2014 age.\n(b) The results of the rapid and confirmatory tests (number of positives and negatives) and, where applicable, of the discriminatory testing, the tissue sampled and the rapid test and confirmatory technique used.\n(c) The geographical location, including the country of origin if not the same as the reporting Member State, of positive cases of TSE.\n(d) The genotype and species of each cervid found positive for TSE.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reporting periods\nThe results of the sampling for CWD for the previous year shall be reported in an annual report.\nThis report shall be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than six months after the end of each year of the survey.\nThe 2007 report shall include the results of the 2007 hunting season, even when some samples will have been taken in 2008."}
