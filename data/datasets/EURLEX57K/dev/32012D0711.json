The consequences of the uncontrolled circulation of conventional weapons are central to four of these five challenges. The Strategy underlines the importance of export controls to contain proliferation.\n(2) On 5 June 1998, the Union adopted a politically binding Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, setting common criteria to regulate the legal trade in conventional weapons. The Code was regularly updated.\n(3) The EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, provides that the Union, at regional and international levels, supports the strengthening of export controls and the promotion of the criteria of the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports by, inter alia, helping third countries to draft relevant national legislation and promoting measures to improve transparency.\n(4) The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was replaced on 8 December 2008 by the legally binding Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP\u00a0(1) which provides for common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment. Common Position 2008/944/CFSP establishes eight criteria against which applications for export of conventional arms are to be assessed. It also includes a notification and consultation mechanism for arms exports denials, and transparency measures such as the yearly publication of an EU annual report on arms exports.\n(5) In accordance with Article 7 of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and in order to maximise the effectiveness of the Common Position, Member States have agreed to work within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) to reinforce their cooperation and to promote their convergence in the field of exports of military technology and equipment. The principles and criteria of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP have been officially supported by several third countries.\n(6) Article 11 of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP states that Member States have to use their best endeavours to encourage other arms exporting States to apply the criteria contained in that Common Position.\n(7) The Union and its Member States are bound by confidentiality in their information exchange on arms export policy, in particular with beneficiary third countries.\n(8) On 6 December 2006, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, with the support of all Member States of the European Union, adopted Resolution 61/89, entitled \u2018Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms\u2019, thereby formally starting the UN process for the negotiation of an Arms Trade Treaty.\n(9) On 12 January 2010, the UN General Assembly, with the support of all Member States of the European Union, adopted Resolution 64/48, entitled \u2018The Arms Trade Treaty\u2019, convening the UN Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty to sit for four consecutive weeks in 2012 to elaborate a legally binding instrument on the highest possible common international standards for the transfer of conventional arms.\n(10) While the UN Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty of July 2012 did not agree on a final text of the Treaty, it nonetheless achieved considerable progress as reflected in the draft of the Treaty text presented by the President of the Conference on 26 July 2012. The Union fully supports the swift completion of negotiations in early 2013 through the convening of a final shorter UN Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, under the same rules as those followed in the first Conference, to conclude negotiations on the Treaty on the basis of the President\u2019s draft text of 26 July 2012.\n(11) The Council adopted, in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2012, conclusions in support of the negotiation of an Arms Trade Treaty, underlining the importance of cooperation in this process with other States and regional organisations.\n(12) On 17 March 2008, the Council adopted Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP on support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports among third countries\u00a0(2). In the framework of the Joint Action, a series of four regional seminars was organised for countries in South Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe and Southern Caucasus, and North Africa.\n(13) On 22 December 2009, the Council adopted Decision 2009/1012/CFSP on support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP among third countries\u00a0(3). In the framework of Decision 2009/1012/CFSP, a series of five regional seminars was organised for countries in South Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe and Southern Caucasus, and North Africa. Decision 2009/1012/CFSP also provided for the organisation of four study visits for EU candidate countries, hosted by Member States.\n(14) Over the past years, the Union has been providing assistance to improve export controls of dual-use goods in third countries, in the framework of projects undertaken under EU financial instruments other than the CFSP budget.\n(15) The German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (hereinafter \u2018BAFA\u2019) had been entrusted by the Council with the technical implementation of Decision 2009/1012/CFSP and successfully completed the organisation of all activities foreseen therein in January 2012. BAFA has also been identified as the implementing agency of EU-funded projects on export controls on dual-use goods under the Instrument for Stability. Against this background, the selection of BAFA as the implementing agency of further Union activities in the field of export controls is justified by its proven experience, qualifications and necessary expertise related to the implementation of relevant acquis of the Union and its promotion vis-\u00e0-vis third countries and will enhance the continuity and overall coherence of Union assistance in this field,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of promoting peace and security and in line with the European Security Strategy, the Union shall pursue the following objectives:\n(a) to promote improved controls on arms exports by third countries in accordance with the principles set out in Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, and seek complementarity and synergies with Union assistance projects in the field of export controls on dual-use goods;\n(b) to support third countries\u2019 efforts at national and regional levels to render trade in conventional weapons more responsible and transparent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union shall pursue the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 through the following project activities:\n(a) continuing to promote, among third countries, the criteria and principles of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, based on the achievements reached through the implementation of Decision 2009/1012/CFSP and Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP;\n(b) assisting third countries in drafting, updating, and implementing, as appropriate, relevant legislative and administrative measures aiming at establishing an effective system of conventional arms export controls;\n(c) assisting countries in the training of licensing and enforcement officers to ensure adequate implementation and enforcement of arms export controls;\n(d) promoting transparency and responsibility in international arms trade, including through support to national and regional measures to promote transparency and appropriate scrutiny in the exports of conventional weapons;\n(e) encouraging third countries to support the elaboration and implementation of a legally binding Arms Trade Treaty establishing international common standards for the global trade in conventional arms.\nA detailed description of the project activities referred to in this paragraph is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (hereinafter \u2018High Representative\u2019), shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The technical implementation of the project activities referred to in Article 1(2) shall be carried out by BAFA.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BAFA shall perform its tasks under the responsibility of the High Representative.

These objectives shall be pursued in accordance with the principles set in Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and seeking complementarity and synergies with Union\u2019s assistance projects in the field of export controls on dual-use goods.\nIn order to achieve the abovementioned objectives, the Union shall continue to promote the principles and criteria of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, building on the achievements reached through the implementation of Decision 2009/1012/CFSP and Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP. For this purpose, assistance shall be provided to third countries to draft, update and implement, as appropriate, relevant legislative and administrative measures aiming at establishing an effective system of conventional arms export controls. Support should also be given to the training of licensing and enforcement officers in third countries responsible for the implementation and enforcement of arms export controls, and to national and regional measures to promote transparency and appropriate scrutiny in the exports of conventional weapons.\nThe objective of rendering international trade in conventional weapons more responsible and transparent will also be pursued through the promotion, vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, of the elaboration and implementation of a legally binding Arms Trade Treaty, establishing common international standards for the global trade in conventional arms.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of project activities\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project objective\nTo provide technical assistance to a number of interested third countries which have demonstrated a willingness to improve their standards and practices in the field of the control of exports of military technology and equipment, and to align their standards and practices to those agreed and applied by Member States, and laid down in Common Position 2008/944/CFSP and the accompanying User\u2019s Guide.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project description\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regional workshops\nThe project will take the form of up to eight two-day workshops for third countries\u2019 state officials, providing training in relevant areas of conventional arms export controls.
