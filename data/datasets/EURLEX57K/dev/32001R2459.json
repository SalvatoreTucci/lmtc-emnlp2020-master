The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 28/97 should therefore be amended.\n(3) This Regulation will enter into force after the expiry of the time limit for submitting licence applications in December 2001. To avoid a break in supplies to the French overseas departments, provision should be made to derogate from Article 4(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 28/97 and to allow, for this month alone, the submission of licence applications in the five working days following the entry into force of this Regulation and to set the time limit for the issue of such licences at 10 working days following the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 28/97 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "By way of derogation from Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 28/97, December 2001 applications for licences shall be submitted to the competent authority no later than the fifth working day following the entry into force of this Regulation.\nBy way of derogation from Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 28/97, in December 2001 licences shall be issued no later than 10 working days after the entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(2) OJ L 6, 10.1.1997, p. 15.\n(3) OJ L 22, 24.1.2001, p. 7.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX\nAssessment of supply requirements for vegetable oils (other than olive oil) for the processing industry falling within CN codes 1507 to 1516 (except 1509 and 1510 for the French overseas departments for 2001\n>TABLE>\""}
