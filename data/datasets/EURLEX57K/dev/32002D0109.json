This Decision has subsequently been amended twice, last by Decision 2001/313/EC(5). The measures include a ban on the imports into the Community of live salmon and stringent conditions for the importation of salmon products for human consumption. These measures apply until 1 February 2002.\n(2) During 2001 Norway has reported further outbreaks of ISA. Despite the protective measures taken by the Norwegian Veterinary Authorities, a rapid eradication of disease cannot be envisaged.\n(3) In the light of the disease situation in Norway, the measures of Decision 1999/766/EC should be extended until 1 February 2003.\n(4) It is appropriate to prolong the restriction measures concerning the eggs and gametes of the family Salmonidae provided for in Decision 1999/766/EC until the risk of transmission of ISA via these products is reviewed and properly assessed. The period for the review of these measures shall therefore also be extended until 1 February 2003.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 4 of Decision 1999/766/EC the words \"1 February 2002\" are replaced by \"1 February 2003\" and the words \"31 December 2001\" are replaced by \"1 February 2003\".", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 February 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(2) OJ L 162, 1.7.1996, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(4) OJ L 302, 25.11.1999, p. 23.\n(5) OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 67."}
