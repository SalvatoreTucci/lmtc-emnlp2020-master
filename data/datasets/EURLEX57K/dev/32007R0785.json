That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) (Phyzyme XP 5000G Phyzyme XP 5000L), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening, and sows to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1743/2006\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening, and sows. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 17 October 2006 that the preparation 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) (Phyzyme XP 5000G Phyzyme XP 5000L) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(3). It further concluded that that preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation does not have an adverse effect on these additional animal categories. The opinion of the Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 July 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
