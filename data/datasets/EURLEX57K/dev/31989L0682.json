Where both axles are equipped with wheels and tyres of the same size, the  fixed or adjustable track width of both axles must be less than 1 150 mm;'\n2.\nin Annex II, point 3.1.1 is replaced by the following:\n'3.1.1.\nAfter each partial test in the dynamic test procedure, it shall be free from tears or cracks as  described in point 3.1 of Annex III (A).\nIf, during the dynamic test, significant tears or cracks appear, an additional impact test or  crushing test as defined in point 1.6 of Annex III (A) must be performed immediately after the test  which caused these tears or cracks to appear.';\n3.\nin Annex III (A), point 1.6 is replaced by the following:\n'1.6.\nAdditional tests\n'1.6.1.\nIf cracks or tears which cannot be considered negligible appear during an impact test, a second,  similar test, but with a height of fall of:\nHm =  10  \u00d7 12 + 4a\nHm =\nH\n10\n\u00d7\n12 + 4a\n1 + 2a\nshall be performed immediately after the impact  test causing these tears or cracks to appear, ''a'' being the ratio of the permanent deformation\nto  the elastic deformation (a = Dp/De) as measured at the point of impact.\nThe additional permanent deformation due to the second impact must not exceed 30 % of the permanent  deformation due to the first impact.\nIn order to be able to carry out the additional test, it is necessary to measure the elastic  deformation during all of the impact tests.\n,1.6.2.\nIf, during a crushing test, significant tears or cracks appear, a second, similar crushing test,  but with a force equal to 1,2 Fv, shall be performed immediately after the crushing test which  caused these tears and cracks to appear.';\n4.\nin Annex VI, the following point is inserted:\n'7.3.\nIndication and results of any additional dynamic test.'", "Member States shall bring into  force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive  not later than 12 months from 3 January 1990.
