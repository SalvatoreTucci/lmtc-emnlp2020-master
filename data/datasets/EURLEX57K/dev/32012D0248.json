However, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds and in poultry of the subtype H5N1 continue to occur in third countries thereby also posing a risk to animal and human health within the Union.\n(4) Given the epidemiological situation regarding avian influenza, it is appropriate to continue limiting the risks posed by imports of poultry, poultry products, pet birds and other products covered by those Decisions, as well as to maintain biosecurity measures, early detection systems and certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype.\n(5) The period of application of Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/734/EC, 2007/25/EC and 2009/494/EC should therefore be extended until 31 December 2013.\n(6) In 2004, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were detected in Thailand. Therefore, protection measures concerning imports of certain commodities originating from poultry and birds in Thailand were adopted by the Commission.\n(7) Accordingly, Article 1 of Decision 2005/692/EC provides that Member States are to suspend the importation from Thailand of certain products including meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds, and eggs.\n(8) Thailand has implemented a rigorous stamping-out policy in order to eradicate highly pathogenic avian influenza from its territory. The last outbreak of that disease was reported in November 2008 and Thailand declared itself free from highly pathogenic avian influenza with effect from 11 February 2009.\n(9) Commission experts have carried out several inspection missions in Thailand to assess the animal health situation and the disease control systems in place in that third country. The conclusion drawn from the last mission carried out in Thailand is that the overall system gives sufficient guarantees that the concerned products fulfil the relevant Union requirements.\n(10) In view of the favourable animal health situation, in particular as regards the control of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and the guarantees provided by Thailand, the suspension of imports provided for in Article 1 of Decision 2005/692/EC should no longer apply.\n(11) Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/734/EC, 2007/25/EC and 2009/494/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/692/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is deleted;\n(2) in Article 7, the date \u201830 June 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2013\u2019.", "In Article 4 of Decision 2005/734/EC, the date \u201830 June 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2013\u2019.", "In Article 6 of Decision 2007/25/EC, the date \u201830 June 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2013\u2019.", "In Article 3 of Decision 2009/494/EC, the date \u201830 June 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2013\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 24.9.1991, p.\u00a056.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0146, 13.6.2003, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0263, 8.10.2005, p.\u00a020.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0274, 20.10.2005, p.\u00a0105.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a08, 13.1.2007, p.\u00a029.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0166, 27.6.2009, p.\u00a074."}
