Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2) According to Article 128(2) of the Treaty, Member States may issue euro coins subject to approval by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the volume of the issue. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament and the ECB, may adopt measures to harmonise the denominations and technical specifications of all coins intended for circulation to the extent necessary to permit their smooth circulation within the Union.\n(3) Euro banknotes range from 5 to 500 euro. The denominations of banknotes and coins need to allow for cash payments of amounts expressed in euro and cent to be facilitated.\n(4) The single coinage system of the Union should encourage public confidence and entail technological innovations which ensure that it is a secure, reliable and efficient system.\n(5) The acceptance of the system by the public is one of the main objectives of the coinage system of the Union. Public confidence in the system depends on the physical characteristics of the euro coins, which should be as user-friendly as possible.\n(6) Consultations with consumer associations, the European Blind Union and representatives of the vending machines industry were carried out to take into account the specific requirements of important categories of coin users. In order to ensure a smooth changeover to the euro and to facilitate acceptance of the coinage system by users, easy distinction between coins through visual and tactile characteristics needed to be guaranteed.\n(7) The euro coins are more readily distinguishable and easier to become accustomed to because of the link between their diameter and face value.\n(8) Certain special security features are needed in order to reduce the scope for fraud for the 1 and 2 euro coins given their high value. Coins made in three layers and the combination of two different colours in a coin are considered to be the most efficient security features available.\n(9) European Parliament and Council Directive 94/27/EC\u00a0(3) limits the use of nickel in certain products in recognition that nickel could cause allergies under certain conditions. Coins are not covered by that Directive. It seems desirable to reduce the nickel content of coins for reasons of public health.\n(10) Giving the coins one common European and a distinctive national side is an appropriate expression of the idea of the European monetary union between Member States. The common European sides of euro coins bear both the name of the single currency and the denomination of the coin. The national side should neither repeat the name of the single currency nor the denomination of the coin.\n(11) A clear indication of the name of the issuing Member State should be put on the national side of the coin, in order to allow interested coin users to easily identify the issuing Member State.\n(12) The edge lettering of euro coins should be considered part of the national side and should therefore not repeat any indication of the denomination, except for the 2-euro coin, and provided that only the figure \u20182\u2019 or the term \u2018euro\u2019 in the relevant alphabet, or both, are used.\n(13) The designs on the national side of euro coins are decided upon by each Member State whose currency is the euro, and should take into account the fact that euro coins circulate in the whole euro area and not only in the issuing Member State. In order to ensure that coins are immediately recognisable as euro coins also from their national side, the design should be fully surrounded by the 12 stars of the Union flag.\n(14) In order to facilitate the recognition of circulation coins, and to ensure appropriate continuity in the minting, Member States should only be allowed to modify the designs used for the national sides of regular circulation coins once every 15 years, except if the Head of State referred to on a coin changes. This should, however, be without prejudice to changes necessary to prevent counterfeiting of the currency. Changes to the design of the common European side of circulation coins should be decided by the Council and voting rights should be restricted to Member States whose currency is the euro.\n(15) Individual Member States should be allowed to issue commemorative coins to celebrate subjects of major national or European relevance, whereas commemorative coins issued collectively by all Member States whose currency is the euro should be reserved for subjects of the highest European relevance. The 2-euro coin constitutes the most suitable denomination for this purpose, principally on account of the large diameter of the coin and its technical characteristics, which offer adequate protection against counterfeiting.\n(16) Taking into account that euro coins circulate in the whole euro area, to avoid the use of inappropriate designs, issuing Member States should inform each other and the Commission about draft designs for the national side of euro coins in advance of the planned issue date. The Commission should verify the compliance of the designs with the technical requirements of this Regulation. Submission of draft designs to the Commission should be made sufficiently in advance of the planned issue date for issuing Member States to modify the design if necessary.\n(17) Furthermore, uniform conditions for the approval of the designs of the national sides of euro coins should be laid down to avoid the choice of designs which could be considered as inappropriate in some Member States. In view of the fact that the competence for an issue as sensitive as the design of the national sides of the euro coins belongs to the issuing Member States, implementing powers should be conferred on the Council. Any implementing decisions taken on this basis by the Council would be closely connected to the acts adopted by the Council on the basis of Article 128(2) of the Treaty. Therefore, the suspension of the voting rights of the members of the Council representing Member States whose currency is not the euro for the adoption by the Council of those decisions should apply as set out in Article 139(4) of the Treaty. The procedure should allow the issuing Member States to modify the design in due time if so required,", "main_body": ["The series of euro coins shall include eight denominations in the range from 1 cent to 2 euro which shall meet the technical specifications set out in Annex I.", "For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018circulation coins\u2019 means euro coins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications of which are referred to in Article 1;\n(2) \u2018regular coins\u2019 means circulation coins excluding commemorative coins;\n(3) \u2018commemorative coins\u2019 means circulation coins which are intended to commemorate a specific subject as specified in Article 9.", "Circulation coins shall have a common European side and a distinctive national side.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national side of circulation coins shall not repeat any indication of the denomination, or any parts thereof, of the coin.
