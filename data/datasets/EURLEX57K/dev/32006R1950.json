A substance should only be included in that list in exceptional circumstances where no satisfactory alternative treatment for a therapeutic indication is authorised and where the condition would, if untreated, create unnecessary suffering for the animal.\n(7) Specific disease conditions or zootechnical purposes might require a choice of substances to be available in order to cater for different requirements related to the age and utilisation of equidae.\n(8) Since, pursuant to Directive 2001/82/EC, substances listed in Annexes I, II or III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 which are not authorised in products intended for equidae may, in certain circumstances, be used for the treatment of equidae, those substances should not appear on the list of essential substances. Furthermore, no substances listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be included in the list. Consequently, the inclusion of a substance in Annexes I to IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should preclude its use as an essential substance for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(9) It is necessary to ensure an appropriate surveillance of equidae which have been treated with essential substances. Therefore, the control mechanisms laid down in Commission Decision 93/623/EEC of 20 October 1993 establishing the identification document (passport) accompanying registered equidae\u00a0(5) and Decision 2000/68/EC of 22 December 1999 amending Commission Decision 93/623/EEC and establishing the identification of equidae for breeding and production\u00a0(6) to safeguard consumer health should apply.\n(10) It is necessary to ensure that any amendment of the list of essential substances is subject to a harmonised scientific evaluation carried out by the European Medicines Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In addition, the Member States and veterinary professional associations which have requested an amendment of that list should duly substantiate their request and provide relevant scientific data.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The list of substances essential for the treatment of equidae, hereinafter \u2018essential substances\u2019, applicable by way of derogation from Article 11 of Directive 2001/82/EC, is set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Essential substances may be used, for the specific disease conditions, treatment needs or zootechnical purposes specified in the Annex, where no medicinal product authorised for equidae or referred to in Article 11 of Directive 2001/82/EC would yield equally satisfactory results in terms of successfully treating the animal, avoiding unnecessary suffering for the animal, or ensuring the safety of those treating the animal.\nFor the purposes of the first paragraph, the alternatives listed in the Annex shall be considered.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Essential substances may be used only in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/82/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The details of a treatment with essential substances must be recorded in accordance with the instructions laid down in Section IX of the identification document for equidae set out in Decisions 93/623/EC and 2000/68/EC.", "Any substance that is entered in one of the lists in Annexes I to IV to Regulation (EC) No 2377/90, or the use of which for equidae is prohibited by Community legislation, shall no longer be used as an essential substance for the purposes of this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Medicines Agency shall, at the request of the Commission, ensure that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use carries out a scientific evaluation of any draft amendment to the list set out in the Annex.\nWithin 210 days of receiving such a request, the European Medicines Agency shall deliver an opinion to the Commission on the scientific suitability of the amendment.\nWhere appropriate, the European Food Safety Authority shall also be consulted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Member States or veterinary professional associations ask the Commission to amend the list set out in the Annex they shall duly substantiate their request and include any relevant scientific data available.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 1.
