The aid amounts granted for 2000 should therefore be maintained.\n(5) As a result, the Annexes to Regulations (EEC) No 2312/92 and (EEC) No 1148/93 should be amended.\n(6) This Regulation will enter into force after the expiry of the time limit for submitting licence applications in January 2001. To avoid a break in supplies to the French overseas departments, provision should be made to derogate from Article 9(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2312/92 and Article 4(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1148/93 and to allow, for that month alone, the submission of licence applications in the five working days following the entry into force of this Regulation and to set the time limit for the issue of such licences at 10 working days after the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
