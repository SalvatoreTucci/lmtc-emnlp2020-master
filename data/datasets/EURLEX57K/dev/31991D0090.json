For the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission   (1) OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 19.\nANNEX\nI\nNATURE OF COURSES\n1. The courses are intended for personnel actually taking part in inspection operations. They are designed to develop the knowledge of such personnel and, by the pooling of their experience, to strengthen mutual trust. On account of the role  veterinarians play in the inspection system set up in the Community context, certain courses are specifically intended for them.\n2. In principle, the courses will last two weeks and be open to about 22 trainees. They will be a mixture of theory and practical exercises. The trainees will also together take part in drawing up a report on a subject, the Community importance of which  will become apparent during the course.\nII\n1. Module No 1: Meat, cuts of meat and minced meat (veterinarians)\nIn principle, this module is reserved for veterinarians. In the light of the Community rules applicable on the matter, the emphasis will be on the new approach as regards inspections (extension of ante mortem inspections to cover livestock, search for  residues, link between the ante and post mortem inspection). With regard to cuts of meat and minced meat, the course will concentrate mainly on the inspection methods for product hygiene (technological, physico-chemical and microbiological criteria).\n2. Module No 2: Meat, cuts of meat and minced meat\nThe course corresponding to this module will be centred on the inspection techniques in the production undertakings, particularly in the slaughterhouses. Pursuant to Community rules, attention will be given to hygiene on the premises and of personnel  and ante and post mortem inspections. Matters relating to market preparation, storage and transport will also be looked into.\n3. Module No 3: Meat-based products, meat-based preparations, ready-to-serve dishes\nThis module covers the main points of Module No 2 but relates to meat-based products, meat-based preparations and ready-to-serve dishes and to the establishments in which they are processed. The specific technologies relating to these types of products  and their repercussions on health will also be studied.\n4. Module No 4: Milk and milk products\nOn the basis of work undertaken at Community level, the course will concentrate mainly on the inspection methods for milk and milk products.\nThe emphasis will be on the inspections of raw milk as a raw material and of milk-based products (physical, chemical and bacteriological checks).\n5. Module No 5: Fishery products, molluscs and crustaceans, acquaculture products\nThis module covers the various health aspects for the placing on the market and for the transport and processing of fishery products, molluscs and crustaceans. The emphasis will in particular be on organoleptic, physico-chemico and microbiological  checks.\nAs regards the agriculture products, the course will include an analysis of the types in breeding establishments with a view to preventing the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases, as well as consideration of the problems associated with the  presence of residues.\nIII\nPROVISIONAL TIMETABLE OF THE COURSES\nApril 1991:  Meat, cuts of meat and minced meat (Veterinarians)  October 1991:  Meat-based products, meat-based preparations, ready-to-serve dishes  February 1992:  Milk and milk products  April 1992:  Meat, cuts of meat and minced meat  September  1992:  Meat-based products, meat-based preparations, ready-to-serve dishes  October 1992:  Fishery products, molluscs and crustaceans, aquaculture animals and products  February 1993:  Milk and milk products  April 1993:  Meat, cuts of meat and minced  meat (Veterinarians)  September 1993:  Meat, cuts of meat and minced meat  October 1993:  Fishery products, molluscs and crustaceans, aquaculture animals and products"}
