Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose new Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.\n(2) The quota amount for certain autonomous Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. Consequently, these quota amounts should be increased.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community on the role of national parliaments in the European Union.\n(5) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 July 2005, it should enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The quotas listed in the Annex to this Regulation shall be added to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 with effect from 1 July 2005.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2005, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2626 is fixed at 1\u00a0600\u00a0000 units.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 July 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nI.
