COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission\u00a0(1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament\u00a0(2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee\u00a0(3),\nWhereas equidae, being live animals, are included in the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty;\nWhereas in order to ensure the rational development of equidae production, thereby increasing productivity in that sector, rules governing the marketing of equidae in intra-Community trade must be laid down at Community level;\nWhereas the breeding and rearing of equidae and in particular of horses is generally included in the farming sector; whereas it constitutes a source of income for part of the farming population and should therefore be encouraged;\nWhereas satisfactory results in that respect depend largely on the use of equidae registered in stud books maintained by officially approved organizations or associations;\nWhereas disparities exist as regards entry in studbooks; whereas those disparities constitute a barrier to trade within the Community; whereas complete liberalization of trade calls for further harmonization, particularly regarding entry in studbooks;\nWhereas intra-Community trade in registered equidae should be progressively liberalized; whereas complete liberalization of trade requires further additional harmonization, in particular as regards approval for the purpose of off-farm mating and the use of semen and ova in accordance with the characteristics of each studbook;\nWhereas it is necessary to draw up, in accordance with a Community procedure, a harmonized model zootechnical origin and identification certificate;\nWhereas the name of an animal is an essential factor in identifying equidae; whereas it is often impossible to trace an animal's descent and monitor its progress if its name is changed at a new owner's request; whereas the rules regarding the naming of equidae should be harmonized, in particular in order to prevent unfair practices;\nWhereas provisions should be introduced preventing equidae from third countries from being imported on terms which are less stringent than those applicable within the Community;\nWhereas it is advisable to adopt implementing measures regarding certain technical aspects; whereas, for the purposes of the measures envisaged, provision should be made for close and effective cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions", "This Directive lays down the zootechnical and genealogical

genealogical grounds other than those resulting from application of this Directive.\nHowever, in the case of intra-Community trade in registered equidae, their semen, ova and embryos, national provisions which comply with the general rules of the Treaty shall be maintained pending the entry into force of the relevant Community decisions referred to in Articles 4 and 8.\nCHAPTER

maintains the studbook of the origin of the breed;\n(b) the criteria for entry and registration in studbooks shall be laid down on the basis of the characteristics of the breed and in particular for certain pure breeds of the need to regulate the entry and registration of equidae produced using artificial reproduction methods.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall establish under the

"The list of organizations and associations maintaining or establishing studbooks, which are recognized on the basis of the criteria to be determined in accordance with Article 4 (2) (a) and

international agreements,\n\u2014 alternative measures may be taken to safeguard the continued identity of the animal in accordance with procedures to be determined by the Commission under the
