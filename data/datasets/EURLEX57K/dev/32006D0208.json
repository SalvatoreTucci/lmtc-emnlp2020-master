That Directive also lays down certain requirements concerning time limits for submission of plans.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC\u00a0(2) lists the third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.\n(3) Certain third countries have presented residue monitoring plans to the Commission for animals and products not listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. The evaluation of those plans and the additional information requested by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring in those countries for the animals and products concerned. Those animals and products should therefore be included in the list for those third countries.\n(4) Certain third countries have not submitted to the Commission the requested guarantees about residue monitoring for animal and products listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. In the absence of these guarantees, those animals and products should therefore be removed from the list for those third countries.\n(5) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 17 March 2006.\nWhere the modification made by this Decision has the effect of removing products from certain countries from the Annex of Decision 2004/432/EC, the amendment shall not apply to consignments containing those products where the operator importing them into the Community can demonstrate that they had left the country in question en route to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 10.
