In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that Regulation, fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member\u00a0States in such a way as to ensure the relative stability of fishing activities of each Member\u00a0State for each stock or fishery.\n(4) The total allowable catches (TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of the available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation with stakeholders.\n(5) For sprat fisheries, the landing obligation referred to in Article\u00a015 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013 applies from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02015. Article\u00a016(2) of that Regulation provides that when a landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches.\n(6) The use of fishing opportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009\u00a0(2) and in particular to Articles\u00a033 and\u00a034 of that Regulation concerning the recording of catches and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by the Member\u00a0States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n(7) In accordance with Article\u00a02 of Council Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0847/96\u00a0(3), when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4 do not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks.\n(8) In order to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02015. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject matter\nThis Regulation fixes the fishing opportunities for\u00a02015 for certain fish stocks in the Black Sea.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to Union vessels operating in the Black Sea.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Black Sea\u2019 means the geographical sub-area\u00a029 as defined in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No\u00a01343/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(4);\n(b) \u2018Union vessel\u2019 means a Union fishing vessel as defined in Article 4(1)(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(c) \u2018stock\u2019 means the stock as defined in Article 4(1)(14) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(d) \u2018total allowable catch\u2019 (TAC) means:\n(i) in fisheries subject to the landing obligation referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the quantity that can be caught from each stock each year;\n(ii) in all other fisheries, the quantity that can be landed from each stock each year;\n(e) \u2018quota\u2019 means a proportion of the TAC allocated to the Union, a Member\u00a0State or a third country.\nCHAPTER II\nFISHING OPPORTUNITIES", "TACs and allocation\nThe TACs for Union vessels, the allocation of such TACs among Member\u00a0States, and the conditions functionally linked thereto, where appropriate, are set out in the Annex.", "Special provisions on allocations\nThe allocation of fishing opportunities among Member\u00a0States as set out in this Regulation shall be without prejudice to:\n(a) exchanges made pursuant to Article\u00a016(8) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013;\n(b) deductions and reallocations made pursuant to Article\u00a037 of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01224/2009;\n(c) additional landings allowed in accordance with Article\u00a015(9) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01380/2013;\n(d) quantities withheld in accordance with Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(e) deductions made pursuant to Articles\u00a0105 and\u00a0107\u00a0of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01224/2009.", "Conditions for landing catches and by-catches not subject to the landing obligation\nCatches and by-catches of turbot in fisheries not subject to the landing obligation shall be retained on board or landed only if they have been taken by Union vessels flying the flag of a Member\u00a0State having a quota and that quota is not exhausted.\nCHAPTER III\nFINAL PROVISIONS", "Data transmission\nWhen, pursuant to Articles\u00a033 and\u00a034 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009, Member\u00a0States submit data to the Commission relating to landings of quantities of stocks caught, they shall use the stock codes set out in the Annex\u00a0to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member\u00a0States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 January 2015.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
