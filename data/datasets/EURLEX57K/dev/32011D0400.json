Several members of staff have made use of this possibility.\n(7) Consequently, the number of staff members continuing to be employed under the Europol Staff Regulations, and hence their contributions to the Europol pension fund pursuant to Article 37(1) of Appendix 6 of the Europol Staff Regulations, have, as from 1 January 2010, steadily decreased and are to be discontinued once the last employment contract to which the Europol Staff Regulations apply has expired.\n(8) As a result, the management of the fund is to be adapted to the decreased volume of both the contributions and disbursements to be made by the fund, by reducing the number of members of the Board of the fund and the number of its meetings.\n(9) It is also reasonable to limit the personal liability of members of the Board acting in the fulfilment of their tasks to gross negligence and serious wrongdoings.\n(10) The liabilities of the fund are also to end at an earlier stage than foreseen when it was created. In the event that the fund\u2019s assets would not suffice to fulfil its liabilities, the shortfall should be covered by Europol\u2019s budget. Given the present financial state of the fund, this eventuality appears to be theoretical, taking also into account that Europol has reinsured the risks stemming from its obligations under Articles 63 to 71 of the Europol Staff Regulations by concluding an insurance on invalidity and survivors\u2019 pensions.\n(11) The Council Act of 12 March 1999 adopting rules on the Europol pension fund\u00a0(5) should thus be amended accordingly. Other technical amendments to that Act resulting from the entry into force of the Europol Decision should also be introduced,", "main_body": ["The Council Act of 12 March 1999 adopting rules on the Europol pension fund is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1 the following point is inserted:\n\u2018(aa) \u201cEuropol Decision\u201d means the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 establishing the European Police Office\u00a0(6) and replacing the Europol Convention;\n(2) in Article 1, point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) \u201cEuropol\u201d means the European Police Office as established by the Europol Decision;\u2019;\n(3) in Article 1, point (g) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(g) \u201cManagement Board of Europol\u201d means Europol\u2019s Management Board as mentioned in Article 37(1) of the Europol Decision;\u2019;\n(4) in Article 1 the following point is added:\n\u2018(h) \u201cEuropol Staff Committee\u201d means the Staff Committee set up in accordance with Article 4 of the Staff Regulations or, in case it ceases to exist, the Staff Committee mentioned in Article 9(1) of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union\u00a0(7).\n(5) in Article 3(1), point (g) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(g) other income, including exceptional contributions received from Europol pursuant to Article 12b.\u2019;\n(6) in Article 3(2), point (d), the words \u2018or desirable\u2019 are deleted;\n(7) Article 4(2) is replaced by the following:\n(8) Article 4(3) is replaced by the following:\n(9) in Article 4(7), the words \u2018the secretary shall in all cases be from the members appointed by Europol or the Europol Staff Committee\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018the secretary shall in all cases be either the member appointed by Europol or the one appointed by the Europol Staff Committee\u2019;\n(10) in Article 5, the following paragraph is added:\n(11) in Article 6(1), the word \u2018twice\u2019 is replaced by the word \u2018once\u2019;\n(12) Article 7(1) is replaced by the following:\n(13) in Article 8(1), the words \u2018solvability, liquidity, rentability\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018solvency, liquidity, profitability\u2019;\n(14) in Article 10(3), the second sentence is replaced by the following:\n(15) Article 10(4) is replaced by the following:\n(16) the following Article is inserted:\n(17) the following Article is inserted:\n(18) Article 13(1) is replaced by the following:\n(19) Article 14 is repealed.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 28 June 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nFAZEKAS S.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 26, 30.1.1999, p. 23.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 121, 15.5.2009, p. 37.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 316, 27.11.1995, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 4.3.1968, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0See document 5397/99 on the Council\u2019s public register: http://register.consilium.eu.int/\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 121, 15.5.2009, p. 37.\u2019;\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 4.3.1968, p. 1.\u2019;"}
