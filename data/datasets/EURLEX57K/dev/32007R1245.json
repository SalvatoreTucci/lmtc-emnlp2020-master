The reference method laid down in Annex I to that Regulation requires that for the detection of Trichinella larvae in meat samples, 10 \u00b1 0,2 g of pepsin is to be added to the sample.\n(2) Reports have been published\u00a0(3) indicating that pepsin powder can cause allergic reactions in certain susceptible individuals.\n(3) Investigations by the Community Reference Laboratory for Parasites indicated that the sensitivity of the reference method of detection for Trichinella is not altered when liquid pepsin is used according to the manufacturer's specifications instead of pepsin powder. Such an alternative should therefore be provided both for the reference method and the equivalent method of detection of Trichinella in meat.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.
