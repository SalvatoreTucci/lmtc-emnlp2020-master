Some of those methods have been amended by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN). In order to take account of the changes in some of the methods in question and promote the European standards, those methods should be adapted. In order to ensure identical and consistent application of the methods in a given intervention period, it should be laid down that the said methods are those in force on the first day of the marketing year.\n(2) The reference method for determining matter other than basic cereals of unimpaired quality, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, is described in Part V of the said Annex. Point 1 of Part V concerning common wheat, durum wheat and barley has been updated by European standard EN 15587:2008. The standard in question should be included in that point.\n(3) Part III of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 defines matter other than basic cereals of unimpaired quality and the factors to be taken into consideration for each type of cereal for defining impurities. For the sake of precision and concordance with European standard EN 15587:2008, certain definitions should be adapted and some subheadings should be moved from one category to another. As a result of those changes to subheadings, Part II of Annex I on minimum quality requirements should also be amended.\n(4) International method ISO 712:1998, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 as one of the methods for determining moisture content, has been updated in respect of cereals other than maize, by European and international standard EN ISO 712:2009. The standard in question should be included. For maize the update provided for in European and international standard EN ISO 6540:2010 should be taken into account. Part VI of Annex I should also be deleted, and paragraph 3 of Part XII of Annex I should be adapted accordingly.\n(5) The reference method for determining the protein content of common wheat grains, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, is the method recognised by the International Association for Cereal Chemistry (ICC), as laid down in standard No 105/2. Following the work of the CEN, that method should be replaced by European and international standard EN ISO 20483:2006 and should be extended to include durum wheat grains. As an alternative method, standard CEN ISO/TS 16634-2:2009 should also be specified.\n(6) International method ISO 5529:1992 for determining the Zeleny index of common wheat, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, has been updated by European and international standard EN ISO 5529:2009. The standard in question should be included.\n(7) International method ISO 3093:2004 for determining the Hagberg falling number, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, has been updated by European and international standard EN ISO 3093:2009. The standard in question should be included.\n(8) The reference method for determining the rate of loss of vitreous aspect of durum wheat, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, is described in Part VIII of the said Annex. Following the work of the CEN, that method should be replaced by European standard EN 15585:2008. The abovementioned standard should be included and Part VIII of Annex I deleted.\n(9) International reference method ISO 7971/2:1995 for determining the specific weight, currently mentioned in Part IV of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, has been updated by European and international standard EN ISO 7971/3:2009. The standard in question should be included.\n(10) This Regulation should apply from the date from which the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 become applicable to cereals.\n(11) However, in order to enable the Member States to implement the amendments and updates introduced by this Regulation, in particular as regards impurities and references to standard EN 15587, a reasonable deadline should be set for the implementation of certain provisions. The amendments in question should therefore apply only from the marketing year 2011/12.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 is amended as follows:\n1.
