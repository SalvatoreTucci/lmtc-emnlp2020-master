Pending harmonisation of rules under Directive 98/8/EC the restrictions on creosote need to be adapted to technical progress.\n(6) This Directive is without prejudice to Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(10) laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers and its individual Directives within the meaning of Article 16(1) of that Directive, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work(11) and Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work(12).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby adapted to technical progress at set out in the Annex hereto.", "1.
