Therefore, to measure the impact of recent policies in this area, it would be essential to collect relevant information with the 2010 ad hoc module.\n(3) The Council Resolution of 17 June 1999 on equal opportunities for people with disabilities\u00a0(5) refers to the need for a comprehensive and comparable dataset on the labour market situation of people with disabilities. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s European Action Plan on equal opportunities for people with disabilities\u00a0(6), which focuses on the active inclusion of people with disabilities, should be monitored. Therefore, this information should be collected through the ad hoc module for 2011.\n(4) There is a need for a comprehensive and comparable set of data on transitions from work into retirement in order to monitor progress towards the common objectives of the European Employment Strategy and of the open method of coordination in the area of pensions launched by the Laeken European Council in December 2001. Both processes identify the promotion of active ageing and prolongation of working life as priorities for action. Therefore, information on the labour market situation of older workers and the main factors influencing their labour market participation and transitions should be collected through the ad hoc module 2012.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 430/2005 of 15 March 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community concerning the codification to be used for data transmission from 2006 onwards and the use of a sub-sample for the collection of data on structural variables\u00a0(7) sets out the characteristics of the sample to be used to collect information on ad hoc modules.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(8),", "main_body": ["The programme of ad hoc modules for the labour force sample survey, covering the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, as set out in the Annex, is hereby adopted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJoaqu\u00edn ALMUNIA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 77, 14.3.1998, p. 3.
