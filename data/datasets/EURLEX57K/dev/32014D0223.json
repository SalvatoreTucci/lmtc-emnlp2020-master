The most recent Commission Decision concerning exemptions from the extended duty pursuant to exemption Regulation was adopted on 19 December 2011\u00a0(4).\n(2) The Commission has published in the Official Journal of the European Union successive lists of bicycle assemblers\u00a0(5) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation. Furthermore, lists of newly exempted bicycle assemblers and lists of revoked exemptions were published.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AUTHORISATION OF EXEMPTION\n(3) The Commission received from the party set out in table 1 all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of its request. Based on that information, the Commission found that the request was admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation. Pursuant to Article 5(1) of the same Regulation, that party has received the suspension as from the day on which the Commission received its request.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nEts Th Brasseur SA Rue des Steppes 13, 4000 Li\u00e8ge Belgium B294\n(4) The Commission established during the examination that the value of the parts originating in the PRC used in this party's assembly operations constituted less than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in those operations. Consequently, they fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009.\n(5) For that reason, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, that party should be exempted from the extended duty.\n(6) Since the exemption will apply only to the party specifically referred to in table 1 with its name and address, it is necessary that exempted party notifies the Commission\u00a0(6) forthwith, of any changes to these (for instance, following a change in the name, legal form or address or following the setting up of new assembly entities). In such case, it is necessary that the party provides all relevant information, in particular on any modification in its activities linked to assembly operations. Where appropriate, the Commission will update the references to this party.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS OF THE DUTIES FOR PARTIES UNDER EXAMIMATION\n(7) The Commission received from the parties under examination listed in table 2 all the information required for the prima facie determination of the admissibility of their requests for exemption. Based on that information, the Commission found that the requests were admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(8) Pending a decision on the merits of requests from the parties under examination listed in table 2, payments of extended duty in respect of any imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation by these parties should be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of the exemption Regulation.\n(9) Since the suspension will apply only to the parties specifically referred to in table 2 with their names and addresses, it is necessary that the parties notify the Commission\u00a0(7) forthwith, of any changes to these (for instance following a change in the name, legal form or address or following the setting up of new assembly entities). In such case, it is necessary that the party provides all relevant information, in particular on any modification in its activities linked to assembly operations.

The payments of the customs debt in respect of the extended duty pursuant to Article 2(1) of the extending Regulation have been suspended pursuant to Article 5 of the exemption Regulation in respect of any imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation by this party as from the day on which the Commission received its request.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nIBEROSELLE, LDA Vale Domingos 3750 \u2014 321 \u00c1gueda Portugal B292\n(11) This party limited its assembly operations to minor quantities and continues to import bicycle parts from the PRC only in quantities below the threshold of 300 units per type on a monthly basis. Therefore, this party has withdrawn its request for an exemption from the anti-dumping duty on bicycle parts.\n(12) On these grounds and pursuant to with Article 7(3) of the exemption Regulation, the Commission has to reject this party's request and lift the suspension of the payment of the extended duty laid down in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation. Consequently, the extended duty should be collected as from the date of receipt of the request for exemption submitted by this party, that is the date on which the suspension took effect.\n(13) What is said in the preceding recital does not exclude the application of an exemption subject to end-use control in accordance with Article 14 of the exemption Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REVOCATION OF EXEMPTION\n(14) For the party set out in table 4 the exemption should be revoked.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBorge Kildemoes Cykelfabrik A/S Albanivej 7, Nr. Lyndelse, 5792 Arslev Denmark A166\n(15) This party was exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty on bicycle parts. The party informed the Commission services that it had ended its assembly operations. For the sake of clarity, the exemption should therefore be revoked.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UPDATE OF REFERENCES TO CERTAIN EXEMPTED PARTIES\n(16) The exempted parties listed in table 5 came forward and informed the Commission that their name, legal form or address has changed. The Commission, after having examined the information submitted, concluded that those changes in no way affect the assembly operations with regard to the conditions of exemption set forth in the exemption Regulation.\n(17) While the exemptions of those parties from the extended duty authorised pursuant to Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation remain unaffected, the references to those parties should be updated.\nFormer reference Change TARIC additional code\nCannondale Europe BV\nHanzepoort 27,\nNL-7575 DB Oldenzaal\n4Ever s.r.o.\n2.
