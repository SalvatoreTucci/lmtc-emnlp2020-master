By way of a transitional measure, for the 1995/96 marketing year, and without prejudice to Article 2 (1) (c) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2294/92 (4), the Member States may set a closing date for producers sowing winter rape to submit applications for advances on compensatory payments for oil seeds.\n2.
