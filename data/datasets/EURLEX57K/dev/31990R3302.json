This Regulation lays down the conditions and detailed rules for the transfer of rights to replant vines between vineyards to areas intended for the production of table wine, table grapes and the cultivation of mother plantations as provided for in the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation:\n- 'transferor' means the person offering replanting rights,\n- 'applicant' means the person wishing to obtain such rights,\n- 'acquirer' means the applicant authorized to carry out the transaction enabling him to acquire rights by transfer,\n- 'rights in hand' means replanting rights resulting from a previous grubbing operation or new planting rights which can be used immediately by the grower concerned,\n- ' \"terroir\" with a given varietal potential' means the natural environmental unit, characterized by geomorphological, pedological and climatic data, which is classified by varietal suitability.\nTITLE I\nGeneral rules", "1. For each transfer application, existence of the right which is the subject of the transfer application must be certified by the competent authorities on the basis of information concerning all the replanting rights for the holding of the transferor. It must be possible from such information to trace the parcel history and the grubbing and replanting that have been carried out on the said\nholding over a period of at least eight years. It must be possible to verify the existence of such rights by means of a monthly entry of grubbing, replanting and new planting in the vineyard register of each Member State or in the Community vineyard register, where the latter is in use in the administrative unit concerned.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation, all grubbing operations liable to give rise to replanting rights must be the subject of an on-the-spot check by the competent authorities. All natural or legal persons intending to grub up an area under vines must present a grubbing declaration to the competent authorities at least 30 days before the commencement of such operations. This declaration shall include information identifying the person, his holding and the parcel to be grubbed, as well as the intended date of grubbing.\n3. The transferor must be in compliance with the Community rules on wine production potential.\n4. Growers who have acquired new planting rights during the five previous marketing years or the current marketing year may not transfer rights.", "To carry out a transfer, the applicant must fulfil the following conditions, for the categories of use of the vine varieties in question:\n- he must not hold any rights in hand, or hold insufficient such rights to carry out the envisaged planting; rights in hand must be used first for any planting on the holding before the rights obtained by transfer may be used,\n- he must not have received a permanent abandonment premium during the five previous marketing years or the current marketing year and must undertake not to apply for such a premium during the five following marketing years, without prejudice to the provisions laid down in Article 4 (2), second indent, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 777/85 (1) and in Article 3 (2), third indent, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 456/80 (2).\nIf, without taking account of transfers, the replanting right may be exercised only on the area where grubbing up was carried out, this condition applies only to the parcels which are the subject of the transfer application,\n- he must not have transferred replanting rights during the previous five marketing years or the current marketing year and he must undertake not to transfer any during the five following marketing years,\n- he must not be infringing Community or national wine rules.", "1. The transfer shall be subject to prior official authorization, which shall be valid only for a specified parcel of destination and a given variety.\n2. Member States shall appoint one or more authorities which shall centrally register transfers, by which transferors shall forego the replanting right in question. The registration shall be entered in the vineyard register, for the purpose of updating the latter. Such registration must make it possible to obtain the information referred to in Article 2 (1), even before the establishment of the vineyard register.\n3. The transfer shall give rise to the issue by the competent authorities to the acquirer of a document containing the following:\n- particulars of the transferor, his holding and the parcel to which the right attaches as set out in the vineyard register or in accordance with the rules in force, in cases where the vineyard register has not yet been established,\n- particulars of the acquirer, his holding and the parcel of destination, as in the previous indent, and the variety and the category of the area in accordance with the conditions for authorization laid down in the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87,\n- the dates of grubbing and of expiry of the right.\n4. After transfer, the right must be used within the period of validity of the right in question and before the end of the second marketing year following that in which the authorization was issued.", "1. Transfers may be carried out only within the same production region. Production characteristics throughout the region must be sufficiently homogeneous to ensure that the generalization of transfers does not give rise to socio-structural or economic imbalances.\nIn particular, the usual agronomic yields must be comparable throughout the region.\n2. The area which may be the subject of a transfer shall be restricted, for each Member State and for each marketing year, to 1 % of the total area intended for the production of table wine, table grapes and the cultivation of mother plantations in the Member State concerned.\n3. Member States shall draw up for each production region:\n- a list of varieties recognized as improving quality and having a moderate yield; varieties planted as the result of a transfer must be among those included in this list,\n- a minimum area of between 10 and 50 ares to be planted under each transfer,\n- a maximum annual acquired area for each holding,\n- allocation criteria specific to each region, which must comply with the quality objectives of this Regulation.\nTo be authorized, transfer applications must fulfil the conditions set out above.\n4. Member States shall notify potential applicants of the definitive criteria before 1 March each year. The criteria may be drawn up in order of priority of allocation; in cases where all the applications together exceed the maximum area indicated in paragraph 2, authorizations shall be granted in accordance with the order of priority or subject to a reduction across the board.", "Transfer applications shall be lodged with the competent authorities before 15 April. The competent authorities shall reply to the applications and forward the transfer authorizations before 1 September.\nHowever, in the case of implementation during the 1990/91 marketing year, the dates in question shall be 1 January 1991 and 1 March 1991 respectively.", "1.

Member States shall inform the Commission, before the end of the marketing year, of the number of transfer authorizations granted for each region during the marketing year, the number of transferors and acquirers, the areas concerned and the average value of the transactions; the information shall be broken down according to the categories of use of the vine varieties.\nThis information may be included in the annual communication made by Member States under Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.", "1. Where a transfer is the subject of a commercial transaction, the amount of the transaction shall be registered.\n2. The national authorities shall ensure that the market is transparent and that winegrowers are informed of the costs of transactions.\nTITLE II\nSpecial rules governing transfers intended for the production of table wines", "1. Transfer authorizations shall be granted subject to compliance with a maximum yield level which may not be exceeded, and which shall be fixed by the Member State in each region.\n2. Authorization shall not be granted for the transfer of rights to plant vines which are to be cultivated using a high productivity system, such as irrigated vines or vines on pergolas.\n3. Where there is a division into 'terroirs' with a given varietal potential, transfer authorizations shall be granted only for varieties recognized as improving quality.", "0\n1. Transfer authorizations shall be granted only in respect of production offering assurances of a consistently high level of quality.\n2.
