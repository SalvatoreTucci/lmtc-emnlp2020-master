The applications are therefore valid.\n(5) As a result of the assessment of the Committee, the particular nutritional purposes \u2018stabilisation of water and electrolyte balance to support the physiological digestion\u2019 and \u2018support of renal function in case of chronic renal insufficiency\u2019 for adult dogs should be added to the list of intended uses and the conditions associated with the particular nutritional purposes \u2018support of heart function in the case of chronic cardiac insufficiency\u2019 and \u2018support of renal function in case of chronic renal insufficiency\u2019 as regards \u2018cats and dogs\u2019 and \u2018reduction of copper in the liver\u2019 should be changed. As a consequence of the new entry \u2018stabilisation of water and electrolyte balance to support the physiological digestion\u2019, the particular nutritional purpose \u2018stabilisation of water and electrolyte balance\u2019 is no longer necessary and should be deleted.\n(6) In order to ensure compliance with the maximum contents for certain nutrients established as \u2018essential nutritional characteristics\u2019 of some particular nutritional purposes, the requirement to place the respective dietetic feed as complete feed on the market should be foreseen. This provision would also ensure the safe use of the feed concerned.\n(7) Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 5/2014\u00a0(3) established the incorporation of feed additives of the functional group \u2018Gut flora stabiliser\u2019 as referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) into certain feed for particular nutritional purposes. However, feed additives currently registered in the group \u2018micro-organisms\u2019 and being in the re-authorisation procedure as referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 could be similarly incorporated into those feeds for particular nutritional purposes. Consequently, the existing feed additives of the group \u2018micro-organisms\u2019 should, pending their re-authorisation, be also covered by Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC.\n(8) Directive 2008/38/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications for the feed currently legally placed on the market, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Feed included in the Annex to this Regulation that has been produced and labelled before 12 May 2015 and which is in compliance with Directive 2008/38/EC before entry into force of this Regulation may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted. In case this feed is intended for pets, the date mentioned in the last sentence is 12 November 2016.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in
