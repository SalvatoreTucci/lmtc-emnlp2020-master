All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) By letter of 18 February 2014 addressed to the Commission, the complainant withdrew its complaint.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, a proceeding may be terminated when the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(8) The investigation has not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Therefore, the Commission considers that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. However, no comments were received.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of agglomerated stone originating in the PRC should be terminated.\n(10) This Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 15(1) of the basic Regulation.", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of tiles and other articles of flat surface, blocks and slabs of artificial stone bound by resins or of an agglomeration of stone and/or glass and/or mirror bound by resins originating in the People's Republic of China and currently falling under CN codes ex\u00a06810\u00a011\u00a090, ex\u00a06810\u00a019\u00a000, ex\u00a06810\u00a091\u00a000, ex\u00a06810\u00a099\u00a000, ex\u00a07016\u00a010\u00a000, ex\u00a07016\u00a090\u00a040, ex\u00a07016\u00a090\u00a070 and ex\u00a07020\u00a000\u00a080 is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a051.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0183, 28.6.2013, p.\u00a021."}
