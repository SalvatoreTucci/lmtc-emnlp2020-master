There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.\n(2) Croatia has notified to the Commission the isolation of an H5 avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case in a wild species. The clinical picture allows the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza pending the determination of the neuraminidase\u00a0(N)\u00a0type and of the pathogenicity index.\n(3) In view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, it is therefore appropriate as an immediate measure to suspend imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds, live birds other than poultry and hatching eggs of these species from Croatia.\n(4) As Croatia is authorised for imports of game trophies, eggs for human consumption and untreated feathers, imports into the Community of these products should be suspended as well because of the animal health risk involved.\n(5) Furthermore the importation into the Community from Croatia should be suspended for fresh meat of wild feathered game and importation of meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of those species.\n(6) Certain products derived from poultry slaughtered before 1 August 2005 should also continue to be authorised, taking into account the incubation period of the disease.\n(7) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC of 3 June 2005 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC\u00a0(3) lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products and establishes treatment regimes considered effective in inactivating the respective pathogens. In order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products, appropiate treatment must be applied depending on the health status of the country of origin and the species the product is obtained from. It appears therefore appropriate, that imports of wild feathered game meat products originating in Croatia and treated to a temperature of at least 70\u00a0\u00b0C throughout the product should continue to be authorised.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision shall be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall suspend the importation from the territory of Croatia of:\n\u2014 live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game, live birds other than poultry as defined in Article 1, third indent, of Decision 2000/666/EC, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds), and hatching eggs of these species,\n\u2014 fresh meat of wild feathered game,\n\u2014 meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of wild feathered game,\n\u2014 raw pet food and unprocessed feed material containing any parts of wild feathered game,\n\u2014 eggs for human consumption,\n\u2014 non-treated game trophies from any birds, and\n\u2014 unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States shall authorise the importation of the products covered by paragraph 1 second to fourth indent, which have been obtained from birds slaughtered before 1 August 2005.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the veterinary certificates/commercial documents accompanying consignments of the products referred to in paragraph 2 the following words as appropriate to the species shall be included:\n\u2018Fresh poultry meat/fresh ratite meat/fresh meat of wild feathered game/fresh meat of farmed feathered game/meat product consisting of, or containing meat of poultry, ratites, farmed or wild feathered game meat/meat preparation consisting of, or containing meat of poultry, ratites, farmed or wild feathered game meat/raw pet food and unprocessed feed material containing any parts of poultry, ratites, farmed or wild feathered game\u00a0(4) obtained from birds slaughtered before 1 August 2005 and in accordance with Article 1(2) of Commission Decision 2005/749/EC.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By derogation from paragraph 1, Member States shall authorise the importation of meat products consisting of or containing meat of wild feathered game under the condition that the meat of these species has undergone at least one of the specific treatments referred to under points B, C or D in Part IV of Annex II to Decision 2005/432/EC.", "Member States shall ensure that for the importation of processed feathers or parts of feathers, a commercial document stating that the processed feathers or parts thereof have been treated with a steam current or by some other method ensuring that no pathogens are transmitted accompany the consignment.\nHowever, that commercial document shall not be required for processed decorative feathers, processed feathers carried by travellers for their private use or consignments of processed feathers sent to private individuals for non-industrial purpose.", "Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
