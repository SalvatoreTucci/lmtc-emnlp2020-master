The request shall be accompanied by proof that a security of EUR 150 per tonne requested has been lodged.\n(3) Experience of applying the Community banana import regime has shown on the one hand that the total quantity of allocations applied far exceeds the quantity available to non-traditional operators, and on the other hand that the number of non-traditional operators has continuously increased. Therefore, a high percentage reduction is applied to each application for annual allocation of non-traditional operators. Taking these elements into consideration, the maximum percentage of 12,5 % should be decreased. The decrease takes into account the different percentage reductions in Quotas A and B and Quota C and also future developments of the annual allocation to non-traditional operators.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["In Article 8(1), second subparagraph, (a), of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, the percentage \"12,5\" is replaced by the percentage \"5\".", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 47, 25.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 345, 29.12.2001, p. 13.\n(3) OJ L 126, 8.5.2001, p. 6.\n(4) OJ L 47, 21.2.2003, p. 12."}
