In order to ensure the full effectiveness of Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EEC as amended by Directive 2007/66/EC, the standard forms of those notices should be adapted so that contracting entities and contracting authorities could include the justification referred to in Article 2f of Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EEC in those notices.\n(3) Directives 89/665/EEC and 92/13/EEC provide for a notice for voluntary ex ante transparency to be used in order to ensure pre-contractual transparency on a voluntary basis.
