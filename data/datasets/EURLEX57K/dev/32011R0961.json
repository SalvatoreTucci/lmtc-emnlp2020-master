Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health in the Union and therefore Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station\u00a0(2) was adopted.\n(3) Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 has been amended at several occasions to take into account the development of the situation. These amendments concerned the adoption of maximum levels of radioactivity to be applied for feed and food originating from Japan, addition of prefectures to the zone for which specific restrictions apply after contamination in these prefectures was found at levels above the maximum levels and removing prefectures from the zone with restrictions in case extensive monitoring has provided evidence that these prefectures were not affected to a significant extent by radioactive contamination.\n(4) Since mid July 2011, the Commission was informed by the Japanese authorities of findings of high levels of caesium in beef from cattle grown in different prefectures in Japan. As the import of beef from Japan into the EU is not allowed for animal and public health reasons other than radioactivity, these findings do not affect the European consumer. Also recently, new food products have been found to contain levels of radioactivity above the maximum levels. These findings and the fact that new/other agricultural/horticultural crops are grown and harvested in the contaminated zone provide evidence that it is appropriate to maintain the current measures after 30 September 2011. It is therefore appropriate to continue to implement the present Regulation until 31 December 2011, instead of 30 September 2011 as initially foreseen. The principle of a monthly review of the implementation of the Regulation is maintained.\n(5) Given that Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 has been amended several times in a short period of time it is appropriate to replace Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 by a new Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to feedstuffs and foodstuffs within the meaning of Article 1 (2) of Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87\u00a0(3) originating in or consigned from Japan, with the exclusion of products which left Japan before 28 March 2011 and of products which have been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011.", "Attestation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All consignments of products referred to in Article 1 shall be subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consignments of products referred to in Article 1 falling outside the scope of Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community for third countries\u00a0(4) shall be introduced into the Union through a designated point of entry within the meaning of Article 3 (b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 (hereinafter \"designated point of entry\")\u00a0(5).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each consignment of products referred to in Article 1 shall be accompanied by a declaration, attesting that:\n(a) the product has been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011, or\n(b) the product originates in and is consigned from a prefecture other than Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka, or\n(c) the product is consigned from Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures, but does not originate in one of those prefectures and has not been exposed to radioactivity during transiting, or\n(d) where a product originates in Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures, the product does not contain levels of radionuclides iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the maximum levels provided for in Annex II to this Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point (d) of paragraph 3 shall apply also to products caught or harvested in the coastal waters of the prefectures referred to therein, irrespective of where such products are landed.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The declaration referred to in paragraph 3 shall be drawn up in accordance with the model set out in Annex I.
