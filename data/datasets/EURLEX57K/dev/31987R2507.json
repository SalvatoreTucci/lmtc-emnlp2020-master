The grains are cut using a Pohl grain cutter.\nEQUIPMENT AND APPARATUS\n- Pohl grain cutter,\n- tweezers, scalpel,\n- tray or dish.\nPROCEDURE\n(a) The determination is carried out on a sample of 100 grams once any matter other than basic cereals of unimpaired quality has been separated;\n(b) Spread the sample on a tray and homogenize well;\n(c) Insert a plate in the grain cutter and spread a handful of grains on the grid. Tap firmly to ensure that there is only one grain in each hole. Lower the movable section to hold the grains in place and then cut them;\n(d) Prepare sufficient plates to ensure that a minimum of 600 grains are cut;\n(e) Count the number of grains which have wholly or partly lost their vitreous aspect (\"mitadin\u00e9\");\n(f) Calculate the percentage of grains which have wholly or partly lost their vitreous aspect (\"mitadin\u00e9\").\nEXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nWhere:\nI = mass, in grams, of matter other than basic cereals of unimpaired quality, and\nM = percentage of cleaned grains examined which have wholly or partly lost their vitreous aspect (\"mitadin\u00e9\").\nthe percentage of grains which have wholly or partly lost their vitreous aspect (\"mitadin\u00e9\") in the test portion is:\n1.2.3 //  // M x (100  I) 100  // = . . .'"}
