Based on the characteristics of this programme, the emphasis is on delegating technical tasks, the main aim being to strengthen the connections between the said Community programme and communities of experts in the Member States.\n(6) The agency will have to mobilise high-level expertise in order to meet the objectives defined by the Commission and under its control. The agency will also have to make it possible to optimise the implementation of the programme by facilitating the recruitment of specialists in public health matters.\n(7) In addition to its tasks in the long term, the agency will improve flexibility in the implementation of the programme. The agency's annual work programme will ensure that it supports the setting of annual priorities for the implementation of the public health programme, arranged and decided by the Commission following the opinion of the programme committee.\n(8) Management based on the results obtained by the agency, together with the establishment of the necessary procedures and channels of control and coordination, will make it possible to simplify the ways in which the programme is implemented by the Commission. The Commission will be able to capitalise on the technical work carried out by the agency, by developing, in parallel and in an appropriate manner, tasks which require political discretion. The Commission will also develop tasks relating to the implementation of the programme which it would be inappropriate to entrust to the agency.\n(9) Cooperation between the agency and the Commission, and the accomplishment of the agency's specific tasks as regards disseminating information and providing assistance to networks, should help to raise the profile of Community action in the field of public health.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nEstablishment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An executive agency for the management of the Community programme in the field of public health (the Agency), the statute of which is laid down in Regulation (EC) No 58/2003, is hereby established.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name of the Agency shall be the \u2018Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme\u2019.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Luxembourg.", "Term\nThe Agency is hereby established for a period beginning on 1 January 2005 and ending on 31 December 2010.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Community programme in the field of public health established by Decision No 1786/2002/EC (framework Decision), the Agency is hereby entrusted with implementing the tasks concerning Community aid under the programme, except for programme evaluation, monitoring of legislation, or any other action which could come under the exclusive competence of the Commission.
