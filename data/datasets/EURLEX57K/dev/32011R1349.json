When assessing the need for a licence system, the Commission takes account of the appropriate instruments for the management of the markets and in particular for monitoring the imports.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008\u00a0(2) in its Article 1(2)(a)(i) in conjunction with its Annex II, Part I, point I, provides for a licence obligation for imports of \u2018bananas, fresh imported under common customs tariff rate of duty\u2019 falling within CN code 0803\u00a000\u00a019.\n(3) Currently, effective import monitoring can be carried out through other means. In the interest of simplification and for the purpose of alleviating the administrative burden for Member States and operators, the requirement of import licences for bananas should be abolished. Article 1(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 of 9 December 2005 on licences under the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community in respect of bananas released into free circulation at the common customs tariff rate of duty\u00a0(3) limits the validity of licences to the year of issue. It is therefore appropriate to repeal the obligation to obtain import licences as from 1 January 2012.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Part I of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 376/2008, Point I \u2018Bananas\n(Part XI of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007)\u2019 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 114, 26.4.2008, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 324, 10.12.2005, p. 3."}
