In order to take account of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union it is necessary to update the notification form used for concentrations which requires certain information based on a list of all Member States.\n(2) In relation to the submission of documents or statements made by persons, undertakings or associations of undertakings within the procedure, it appears advisable to clarify the procedure whereby such documents or statements can be considered as non-confidential.\n(3) On 8 June 2004 the EEA Joint Committee adopted Decision No 78/2004 and Decision\u00a0No 79/2004. These decisions incorporate Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 into the EEA Agreement. In order to take account of these decisions and for reasons of legal clarity and transparency adaptations need to be introduced into the notification forms, in particular the Form RS relating to reasoned submissions (Form RS), which deals with information requirements for pre-notification referrals under Article 4(4) and Article\u00a04(5) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.\n(4) In order to ensure that the Commission is in a position to carry out a proper assessment of commitments offered by the notifying parties pursuant to Article 6(2) or Article\u00a08(2) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 with a view to rendering a concentration compatible with the common market, the notifying parties should be required to submit detailed information concerning the commitments offered and, in particular, to submit specific information if the commitments offered consist in the divestiture of a business.\n(5) In order to satisfy the Commission that the commitments will be implemented in due time and manner it seems appropriate to clarify that the commitments may include details on the appropriate mechanisms proposed by the parties, including the appointment of a trustee to assist the Commission in overseeing compliance.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 802/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 802/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
