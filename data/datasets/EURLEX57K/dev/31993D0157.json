By Regulation  (EEC) No 53/93  (3), the Council extended the validity of this duty for a period not exceeding two  months.\n(2)  In the subsequent procedure it was established that definitive anti-dumping measures should be  taken in order to eliminate injurious dumping. The findings and conclusions on all aspects of the  investigation are set out in (6) to (44) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 611/93  (4).\n(3)  Having been informed of those conclusions, the Korean producers, Goldstar Electron Co. Ltd,  Hyuandai Electronics Industries Co. Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd offered undertakings with  regard to the resale prices for their products to the first independent customers in the Community.  According to those undertakings, the resale prices will reflect the producers' quarterly costs of  DRAM production plus a reasonable amount for profit.\n(4)  Those undertakings are considered by the Commission to have the effect of setting the Korean  producers' resale prices in the Community at a level where dumping is eliminated. Furthermore, as  their basis is the cost of production specific to each Korean producer, the Commission considers  that the undertakings offer sufficient flexibility to ensure that prices on the Community market  remain at a level which does not put the Community user industry at an undue competitive  disadvantage.\n(5)  In addition, since the Korean producers have undertaken to submit detailed and regular cost  and price information to the Commission, it has been concluded that the correct observance of the  undertakings can be effectively monitored by the Commission.\n(6)  In view of the provisions of Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the undertakings  should enter into force on the same date as the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation  (EEC) No 611/93 in the present proceeding.\n(7)  In those circumstances, the undertakings offered are considered acceptable and the  investigation can, therefore, be terminated with respect to the Korean producers concerned.\n(8)  Furthermore, the Commission notes that the producers concerned have been informed of the  essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the definitive anti-dumping measures were  proposed and had the opportunity to comment on all aspects of the investigation. Accordingly, in  these circumstances, if the undertaking has been withdrawn or if the Commission has reason to  believe that the undertaking has been violated, it may, where the interests of the Community so  require, apply provisional anti-dumping duties forthwith under Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC)  No 2423/88 and, subsequently, definitive anti-dumping duties on the basis of the facts established  before the undertaking was given if there is no clear evidence of a substantial change in those  facts.\n(9)  The Advisory Committee was consulted on the acceptance of the undertakings offered, and raised  no objection,", "main_body": ["The undertakings offered by Goldstar Electron Co., Ltd, Hyundai  Electronics Industries Co., Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, in connection with the  anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain types of micro-circuits known as DRAMs  (dynamic random access memories) falling within CN codes 8542  11  12, 8542  11  14, 8542  11  16,  8542  11  18 for finished DRAMs, within CN code ex 8542  11  01 for DRAM wafers, within CN code ex  8542  11  05 for DRAM dice or chips and within CN codes ex 8473  30  10 or ex 8548  00  00 for DRAM  modules and originating in the Republic of Korea are hereby accepted.", "The investigation in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding referred to in Article  1 is hereby terminated in respect of the companies named in that Article."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 1993.\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Member of the Commission"}
