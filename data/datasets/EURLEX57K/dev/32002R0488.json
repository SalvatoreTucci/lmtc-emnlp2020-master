Those CN codes should therefore be subdivided on the basis of the weight of the products concerned and a new subheading should be introduced for CN code 1602 49 19, so that the headings can be grouped in the same category in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the pigmeat sector(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2898/2000(6), and equal treatment ensured for all operators when the refund is paid.\n(3) The Management Committee for Pigmeat has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["In Sector 6 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87, the section concerning CN code 1602 is replaced by the text contained in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to export licences applied for from 8 April 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 March 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 156, 29.6.2000, p. 5.\n(3) OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 348, 31.12.2001, p. 1.\n(5) OJ L 133, 17.6.1995, p. 9.\n(6) OJ L 336, 30.12.2000, p. 32.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
