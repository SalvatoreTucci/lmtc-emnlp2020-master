whereas measures for administering the importing of these animals should be laid down;\nWhereas experience has shown that limiting imports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the planned measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be set aside for 'traditional` importers of cows and heifers of certain mountain breeds; whereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this product group into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available to traders who are able to show that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head in 1996; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable; whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the same Member State;\nWhereas in order to prevent speculation, traders no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 January 1997 should be denied access to the quota;\nWhereas provision should be made for the arrangements to be administered by means of import licences;

whereas this information is important for assessing the market situation; whereas a security relating to communication of that information should be provided for;\nWhereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (8), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate on account of their end-use;
