Those participating NCBs whose claims increase due to the expansion of the capital key on 1 January 2007 should therefore effect a compensatory transfer to the ECB, while the ECB should effect a compensatory transfer to those participating NCBs whose claims decrease due to this expansion.\n(3) The limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred to the ECB will be equivalent to EUR 57\u00a0606\u00a0524\u00a0025,77 with effect from 1 January 2007.\n(4) In accordance with the general principles of fairness, equal treatment and the protection of legitimate expectations underlying the Statute, those participating NCBs whose relative share in the ECB's accumulated equity value increases due to the abovementioned adjustments should also effect a compensatory transfer to those participating NCBs whose relative share decreases.\n(5) The respective capital key weightings of each participating NCB until 31 December 2006 and with effect from 1 January 2007 should be expressed as a percentage of the ECB's total capital as subscribed to by all participating NCBs for the purpose of calculating the adjustment of the value of each participating NCB's share in the ECB's accumulated equity value.\n(6) Accordingly, the adoption of a new ECB decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2003/21 of 18 December 2003 laying down the measures necessary for the contribution to the ECB's reserves and provisions and for adjusting the national central banks' claims equivalent to the transferred foreign reserve assets\u00a0(2) and Decision ECB/2004/8 of 22 April 2004 laying down the measures necessary for the contribution to the European Central Bank's accumulated equity value, for adjusting the national central banks' claims equivalent to the transferred foreign reserve assets, and for related financial issues\u00a0(3).\n(7) Pursuant to Article 1 of Council Decision 2006/495/EC of 11 July 2006 in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Slovenia of the single currency on 1 January 2007\u00a0(4), the derogation in favour of Slovenia referred to in Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession\u00a0(5) is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2007,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n(a) \u2018accumulated equity value\u2019 means the total of the ECB's reserves, revaluation accounts and provisions equivalent to reserves as calculated by the ECB as at 31 December 2006.
