The Commission is required to determine the quantities of controlled substances other than hydrochlorofluorocarbons that may be used for essential laboratory and analytical uses, and the companies that may use them.\n(2) The Commission has published a notice to undertakings intending to import or export controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer to or from the European Union in 2011 and undertakings intending to request for 2011 a quota for these substances intended for laboratory and analytical uses\u00a0(2) and has received declarations on intended laboratory and analytical uses of controlled substances for 2011.\n(3) The determination of the allocated quota shall ensure that the quantitative limits set out in Article 10(6) are respected. As those quantitative limits include quantities of hydrochlorofluorocarbons licensed for laboratory and analytical uses, the production and import of hydrochlorofluorocarbons for those uses should also be covered by this Decision.\n(4) The quantity resulting from the deduction of the quantities allocated to undertakings which produced or imported under licence in the years 2007 to 2009 from the maximum quantity of 110 ODP tons should be allocated to undertakings for which no production or import licences were issued in the reference period 2007 to 2009. The allocation mechanism should ensure that all undertakings requesting a new quota receive an appropriate share of the quantities to be allocated.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009,", "main_body": ["The quotas for importing and producing controlled substances for laboratory and analytical uses in the year 2011 shall be allocated to the undertakings listed in Annex I.\nThe maximum quantities that may be produced or imported in 2011 for laboratory and analytical uses allocated to these undertakings are set out in Annex II.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2011 and shall expire on 31 December 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the following undertakings:\nABCR Dr Braunagel GmbH & Co.\nIm Schlehert 10\n76187 Karlsruhe\nGermany\nAcros Organics BVBA\nJanssen Pharmaceuticalaan 3a\n2440 Geel\nBelgium\nAirbus Operations SAS\nRoute de Bayonne 316\n31300 Toulouse\nFrance\nArkema France SA\n420, rue d\u2019Estienne D\u2019Orves\n92705 Colombes Cedex\nFrance\nBayer CropScience AG (DEU)\nGeb\u00e4ude A729\n41538 Dormagen\nGermany\nEras Labo (FRA)\n222 D1090\n38330 Saint-Nazaire-les-Eymes\nFrance\nHarp International Ltd\nGellihirion Industrial Estate\nRhondda, Cynon Taff\nPontypridd CF37 5SX\nUnited Kingdom\nHoneywell Fluorine Products Europe BV\nLaarderhoogtweg 18\n1101 EA Amsterdam\nNetherlands\nHoneywell Specialty Chemicals GmbH\nWunstorfer Strasse 40\nPostfach 100262\n30918 Seelze\nGermany\nLGC Standards GmbH\nMercatorstr. 51\n46485 Wesel\nGermany\nMallinckrod Baker BV\nTeugseweg 20\n7418 AM Deventer\nNetherlands\nMebrom NV\nMerck KGaA\nFrankfurter Strasse 250\n64271 Darmstadt\nGermany\nMexichem UK Ltd (ex Ineos Fluor)\nPO Box 13\nThe Heath, Runcorn Cheshire WA7 4QX\nUnited Kingdom\nMinistry of Defence\nDefence Fuel Lubricants and Chemicals\nPO Box 10.000\n1780 CA Den Helder\nNetherlands\nPanreac Quimica SA\nPol.
