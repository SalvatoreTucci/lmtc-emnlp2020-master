whereas, therefore, imports of these products originating in or coming from other Member States must continue to be restricted in order to enable these restructuring measures to produce their intended effects;\nWhereas these import restrictions must be accompanied by a monitoring system in respect of imports of the same products originating in non-member countries;\nWhereas it is appropriate that the measures designed to improve and restore to balance the situation in these sectors should be continued for a further 10 months in order to adapt the sectors to Community competition;\nWhereas the provisions adopted cannot, at all events, be expected to restrict imports of each of the products in question to a level below that of actual imports during the corresponding period of 1983;\nWhereas, if the restricted amounts laid down by the Commission in the abovementioned Decisions are not used up, the Greek authorities must authorize the import of the remaining amounts in addition to the quantities specified in this Decision;\nWhereas the volume of imports of the products in question constitutes an even greater source of difficulty in view of the fact that the level of employment in these sectors continues to give cause for concern;\nWhereas the furniture sector is characterized by a substantial number of small units scattered throughout the country; whereas this geographical distribution renders the reorganization and restructuring of this sector with a view to the achievement of economies of scale particularly difficult; whereas, in order to attain this end, the Greek Government has promoted forms of industrial cooperation designed to bring together several production units in a single undertaking in a region where the main outlets of the sector are located, and has encouraged the establishment of a common sales promotion organization;\nWhereas the situation in the construction sector did not improve in the course of the past year, since the index of production fell by 12 % in the first 10 months of 1983 compared with the same period in 1982; whereas the market in porcelain sanitary ware or cast-iron taps, cocks and valves and ceramic tiles is directly dependent on developments in this sector; whereas major investments designed to rationalize and modernize the manufacture of these four products are now in progress, in particular, in order to adjust supply to changing consumer requirements; whereas this change in production requires both more modern equipment and detailed market research; whereas these activities are being conducted in conjunction with other enterprises operating in the common market;\nWhereas, in the cigarette sector, the increasing demand for American-style cigarettes requires both an improvement in product quality, which is now taking place as a result of cooperation with foreign undertakings, and a reorganization of agricultural production in this sector, since the eastern tobacco on which it was formerly based is now less favoured by consumers;\nWhereas, since the sectors concerned are still affected by certain structural deficiencies, an immediate return to an unrestricted system could compromise the reforms introduced;\nWhereas the Commission is not in possession of sufficient data to define limits on cigarette imports for the period in question; whereas the Commission will adopt a decision specifying such limits before 1 February 1984;\nWhereas, in order to ensure a fair distribution of the authorized quantities between both the Member States and the operators in question, Greece must take account of existing trade patterns;\nWhereas the satisfactory implementation of the provisions of this Decision necessitates the definition of particularly precise rules as regards application and management;\nWhereas it is appropriate that the Commission should carry out a permanent check on the data relating to the sectors in question and that, in this connection, it should reserve the right to amend upwards the quantities given herein, and to amend or repeal this Decision;\nWhereas, in the light of the Commission's examination of the economic difficulties affecting the sectors in question, the restrictions introduced represent measures which, whilst making it possible to achieve the desired objective, entail the minimum disruption to the functioning of the common market,", "main_body": ["Greece is authorized to limit imports to Greece of the products listed in Article 2, or to keep such products under surveillance, until 31 October 1984.", "1.
