Flights related to search and rescue mean flights offering search and rescue services.

Firefighting flights mean flights performed exclusively to provide aerial firefighting services, which means the use of aircraft and other aerial resources to combat wildfires.\n20.

Flights with the CRCO exemption code \u2018N\u2019 and flights identified with STS/FLTCK in field 18 of the flight plan are presumed to be exempted under subparagraph (g).\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exemption under subparagraph (i) (public service obligation flights)\n29.

All commercial air transport operators must hold an air operator\u2019s certificate (AOC) under Part I of Annex 6 to the Chicago Convention. Operators without such a certificate are not \u2018commercial air transport operators\u2019\n31. For the application of the de minimis rule, the characteristic of being commercial is linked to the operator and not to the flights in question. That means in particular that the flights provided by a commercial operator shall be taken into account for deciding whether that operator falls above or below the exemption thresholds even if those flights are not provided for remuneration.\n32. Only flights which depart from or arrive in an aerodrome situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies shall be taken into account for deciding whether the aircraft operator falls above or below the exemption thresholds of the de minimis rule. Flights exempted under subparagraphs (a)-(j) shall not be taken into account for the same purposes.\n33. Flights performed by a commercial aircraft operator operating fewer than 243 flights per period for three consecutive four-month periods are exempted. The four-month periods are: January to April; May to August; September to December. The local time of departure of the flight determines in which four-month period that flight shall be taken into account for deciding whether the aircraft operator falls above or below the exemption thresholds of the de minimis rule.\n34. A commercial operator operating 243 flights per period or more is included in the Community scheme for the whole calendar year in which the threshold of 243 flights is reached or exceeded.\n35. A commercial operator operating flights with total annual emissions equal or higher than 10\u00a0000 tonnes per year is included in the Community scheme for the calendar year in which the threshold of 10\u00a0000 tonnes is reached or exceeded."}
