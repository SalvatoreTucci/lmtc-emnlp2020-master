In addition, in certain cases, the use of those licences was facilitated as regards the origin and CN code of the rice to be imported.\n(2) Despite the new provisions, some import licences could not be used during their period of validity because of disturbances in the flows of rice imports into the Community caused, in particular, by the presence on the US market of rice contaminated with genetically modified rice and the resulting risk of imports being blocked. Given these special circumstances, Member States should be allowed to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(5) and to release, on a case-by-case basis, the security lodged by importers where certain conditions are met.\n(3) Member States should also be allowed to return to the importers concerned the export licences submitted in support of their import licence applications in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 327/98.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1610/2006 should therefore be amended.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1610/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
