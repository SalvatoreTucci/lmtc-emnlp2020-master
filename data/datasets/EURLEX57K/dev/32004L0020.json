That list includes chlorpropham.\n(2) For chlorpropham, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. Pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(3), the Netherlands was designated as rapporteur Member State. The Netherlands submitted the relevant assessment report and recommendations to the Commission on 30 April 1996 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.\n(3) This assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(4) The review was finalised on 28 November 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for chlorpropham.\n(5) The review for chlorpropham did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.\n(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing chlorpropham may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include chlorpropham in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing chlorpropham can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that directive.\n(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing chlorpropham, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 July 2005 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
