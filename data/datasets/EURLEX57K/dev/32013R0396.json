particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(9) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) On the basis of experience from the monitoring of CO2 emissions from new passenger cars in 2010 and 2011, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 was amended to simplify the collection of the relevant data and to provide manufacturers with the means to efficiently verify those data.\n(2) In order to provide for a coherent approach in the monitoring of CO2 emissions, it is appropriate to align Commission Regulation (EU) No 1014/2010 of 10 November 2010 on monitoring and reporting of data on the registration of new passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) with the amendments made to Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009.\n(3) Regulation
