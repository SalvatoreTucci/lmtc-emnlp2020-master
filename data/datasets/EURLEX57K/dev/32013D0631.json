The common charging scheme is an integral element in reaching the objectives of the performance scheme as established under Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 390/2013\u00a0(4).\n(2) Commission Decision 2011/121/EU\u00a0(5) set European Union-wide performance targets including a cost-efficiency target for the provision of air navigation services for the years 2012 to 2014. By letters of 19 July 2012 and 17 December 2012 the Commission informed Member States that their revised performance plans and targets are consistent with, and adequately contributing to, the adopted European Union-wide performance targets. Cost-efficiency targets are expressed in terms of determined unit rates.\n(3) Article 17(1)(c) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 provides that the Commission shall assess the 2014 unit rates for charging zones submitted by the Member States to the Commission by 1 June 2013 following the requirements of Article 9(1) and 9(2) of that Regulation. This assessment shall check the compliance of the 2014 unit rates with Implementing Regulations (EU) No 390/2013 and (EU) No 391/2013.\n(4) The Commission has carried out its assessment of the 2014 unit rates for charging zones with the support of the Performance Review Body (PRB) and Eurocontrol\u2019s Central Route Charges Office and using the data and additional information provided by the Member States by June 2013. The assessment also took into account the explanations given and corrections made before the consultation meeting held on 26 June 2013 in application of Article 9(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 as well as subsequent correspondence between the Commission and Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n(5) Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania proposed to partially or fully offset the adjustments foreseen under Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 with the effect of lowering or maintaining a certain level of the unit rate, which is in the interest of airspace users. Therefore, these amounts should not be recovered in subsequent years.\n(6) The Commission notes that Spain intends to apply a transitional provision in accordance with Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1191/2010\u00a0(6). The Commission has verified the information provided by Spain in this regard and agrees that Spain fulfils the conditions of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1191/2010 and may decide to exempt from Article 11a(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006\u00a0(7) the determined costs of providers of air navigation services. Thus, the traffic risk sharing mechanism with its 30/70 sharing between air navigation service providers and airspace users of the gain or loss resulting from a difference between actual service units and forecasted service units should apply already as of 0\u00a0% difference instead of 2\u00a0% difference. In line with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1191/2010 and the reduction of the unit rate decided by Spain for the year 2012, this exemption is limited to the traffic risk sharing in respect to the revenues of that year. Spain intends to spread the resulting carry-over over the next years, starting from 2015.\n(7) Article 17(1)(d) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 provides that the Commission shall notify the Member States concerned where the unit rates comply with Implementing Regulations (EU) No 390/2013 and (EU) No 391/2013.\n(8) The notification that unit rates for charging zones are in compliance with Implementing Regulations (EU) No 390/2013 and (EU) No 391/2013 should be without prejudice to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004,", "main_body": ["The 2014 unit rates for charging zones in the Annex to this Decision are in compliance with Implementing Regulations (EU) No 390/2013 and (EU) No 391/2013.", "The notification that unit rates for charging zones are in compliance with Implementing Regulations (EU) No 390/2013 and (EU) No 391/2013 is without prejudice to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nSiim KALLAS\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 96, 31.3.2004, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 of 3 May 2013 laying down a common charging scheme for air navigation services (OJ L 128, 9.5.2013, p. 31).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the Single European Sky (the framework Regulation) (OJ L 96, 31.3.2004, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 390/2013 of 3 May 2013 laying down a performance scheme for air navigation services and network functions (OJ L 128, 9.5.2013, p. 1).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2011/121/EU of 21 February 2011 setting the European Union-wide performance targets and alert thresholds for the provision of air navigation services for the years 2012 to 2014 (OJ L 48, 23.2.2011, p. 16).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1191/2010 of 16 December 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006 laying down a common charging scheme for air navigation services (OJ L 333, 17.12.2010, p. 6).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2006 of 6 December 2006 laying down a common charging scheme for air navigation services (OJ L 341, 7.12.2006, p. 3).\nANNEX\nCharging zone 2014 en route unit rate\nBelgium and Luxembourg 72,04\u00a0EUR\nBulgaria 73,50\u00a0BGN\nCzech Republic 1\u00a0198,16\u00a0CZK\nDenmark 537,56\u00a0DKK\nGermany 77,32\u00a0EUR\nEstonia 23,97\u00a0EUR\nIreland 30,62\u00a0EUR\nGreece 34,53\u00a0EUR\nSpain Continental 71,69\u00a0EUR\nSpain Canary Islands 58,36\u00a0EUR\nFrance 65,77\u00a0EUR\nItaly 78,83\u00a0EUR\nCyprus 38,41\u00a0EUR\nLatvia 19,99\u00a0LVL\nLithuania 162,08\u00a0LTL\nHungary 13\u00a0190,76\u00a0HUF\nMalta 27,61\u00a0EUR\nNetherlands 66,47\u00a0EUR\nAustria 73,39\u00a0EUR\nPoland 148,89\u00a0PLN\nPortugal \u2014 Lisbon 38,74\u00a0EUR\nRomania 168,83\u00a0RON\nSlovenia 67,46\u00a0EUR\nSlovak Republic 60,04\u00a0EUR\nFinland 52,06\u00a0EUR\nSweden 638,85\u00a0SEK\nUnited Kingdom 70,46\u00a0GBP\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0These unit rates do not include the administrative unit rate referred to in Article 18 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 and applying to those States parties to Eurocontrol\u2019s Multilateral Agreement relating to route charges."}
