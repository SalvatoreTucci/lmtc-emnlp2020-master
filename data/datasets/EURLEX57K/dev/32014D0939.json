The measures were confirmed and the Annex to that Implementing Decision amended by Commission Implementing Decision 2014/833/EU\u00a0(5) in order to take into account the establishment of protection and surveillance zones around further outbreaks in Ter Aar and Kamperveen where veterinary restrictions according to Directive 2005/94/EC are applied.\n(4) On 30 November 2014 a further outbreak was confirmed in a poultry holding in Zoeterwoude in Zuid-Holland. The measures according to Directive 2005/94/EC were immediately implemented including the establishment of the protection and surveillance zones.\n(5) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to define the protection and surveillance zones established on account of the new outbreak in the Netherlands at Union level in collaboration with that Member State and to fix the duration of that regionalisation.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2014/833/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision
