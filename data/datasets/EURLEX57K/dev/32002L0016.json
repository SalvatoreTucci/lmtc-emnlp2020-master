The Committee is therefore of the opinion that at present, it is not appropriate to use NOGE as an additive in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs due to its tendency to migrate in this application.\n(8) The use and/or presence of NOGE components with more than two aromatic rings and their derivatives in plastic materials and articles, surface coatings and adhesives intended to come into contact with foodstuffs should be regulated through the establishment of a strict limit, which should, in practice, provisionally rule out their use as additives. This provisional limit should apply pending the submission of adequate data for a more complete scientific risk assessment, in accordance with Article 5(7) of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and the development of adequate methods for the determination of their levels in foodstuffs.\n(9) The use and/or presence of NOGE and BFDGE as starting substances for the preparation of special coatings used to cover the surfaces of very big containers should provisionally be allowed to continue, pending the submission of further technical data. The large volume/surface area ratio of these containers, their repeated use over their long lifetime which reduces migration, and their contact with foodstuffs at ambient temperature in the majority of the applications suggest that it is not necessary to set a migration limit for NOGE and BFDGE in such containers.\n(10) Member States which have not yet authorised the use and/or the presence of BADGE and/or BFDGE and/or NOGE in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs should be able to maintain their prohibition.\n(11) The use and/or presence of BADGE, BFDGE and NOGE in plastic materials and articles, surface coatings such as varnishes, lacquers and paints, as well as adhesives, should be regulated at Community level to avoid risks to human health and barriers to the free movement of goods.\n(12) Errors due to the presence of other chemical substances may occur during analysis. Validated methods of analysis are, therefore, necessary for correct verification of compliance with the restrictions set out in the Directive.\n(13) A transitional period should be provided for in respect of materials and articles which are brought into contact with foodstuffs before the deadline for implementation of this Directive.\n(14) This transitional period should also take into account the requirements of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(2), as amended by Commission Directive 2001/101/EC(3).\n(15) In view of the new technical requirements, Commission Directive 2001/61/EC of 8 August 2001 on the use of certain epoxy derivatives in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(4) should be repealed for reasons of clarity.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["1.
