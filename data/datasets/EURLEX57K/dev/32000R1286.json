However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.\n(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.\n(6) Phenoxymethylpenicillin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(7) Calcium aspartate, rhei radix, standardised extracts, preparations thereof, matricaria recutita, preparations thereof, zinc aspartate, sodim salicylate, sodium acetylsalicylate, salicylic acid, methyl salicylate, carbasalate calcium and bismuth subnitrate and aluminium salicylate, basic and Acetylsalicylic acid DL-lysine should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(8) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, methylprednisolone and acetylisovaleryltylosin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(9) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 60th day following its publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 331, 23.12.1999, p. 49.\n(3) OJ L 317, 6.11.1981, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nA.
