Nevertheless, a general framework is necessary for the establishment of the Regional Advisory Councils.\n(4) In the interests of efficiency, it is necessary to limit the size of Regional Advisory Councils whilst ensuring that they include all the interests affected by the Common Fisheries Policy and while recognising the primacy of fishing interests given the effects on them of management decisions and policies.\n(5) In order to ensure consistency on issues of common interest to more than one Regional Advisory Council, it is essential to establish links between the different Regional Advisory Councils.\n(6) In view of the tasks of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture renewed by Commission Decision 1999/478/EC\u00a0(4), which is composed of representatives of a wide range of European organisations and interests, the work of the Regional Advisory Councils should be coordinated with that of the said Committee, to which they should also send their reports.\n(7) In order to ensure the effective establishment of the Regional Advisory Councils, it is essential that public funds contribute to their costs in the start-up phase and to interpretation and translation costs.\n(8) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure\u00a0(5), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the financing provisions, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018Member State concerned\u2019 shall mean a Member State having a fishing interest in the area or fisheries covered by a Regional Advisory Council;\n2. \u2018Fisheries sector\u2019 shall mean the catching sub-sector, including shipowners, small-scale fishermen, employed fishermen, producer organisations as well as, amongst others, processors, traders and other market organisations and women's networks;\n3. \u2018Other interest groups\u2019 shall mean, amongst others, environmental organisations and groups, aquaculture producers, consumers and recreational or sport fishermen.", "Establishment of Regional Advisory Councils\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Regional Advisory Council is established for each of the following:\n(a) the Baltic Sea;\n(b) the Mediterranean Sea;\n(c) the North Sea;\n(d) north-western waters;\n(e) south-western waters;\n(f) pelagic stocks;\n(g) high seas/long distance fleet.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The geographical areas covered by each Regional Advisory Council are set out in Annex I.
