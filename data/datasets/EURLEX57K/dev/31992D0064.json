The planning of the measures for the development and rationalization of aquaculture production corresponding to the investments provided for in the Annex hereto shall be carried out with due regard for the priorities set by the various  Regulations governing the Community structural policies.\n2. Special attention must be given during the implementation of the programme to the interaction between the development of the aquaculture sector and the environment and to the health conditions of fish farms and their products.\n3. Preference shall be given to investment projects to which the Member State applies rules favourable to the development of aquaculture.\n4. Preference shall be given to innovative projects based on adequate research work and ensuring in the long term the diversification of production.\n5. The production objectives of the programme must be checked at regular intervals and adjusted, if necessary, in line with the development of the market for fishery and aquaculture products.\n6. Special attention must be given to the technical viability of eel farms and to their adequate and regular supply with juveniles.", "The Commission shall inform the Member State, if necessary, within six months following 1 April each year, of the failure to comply with the conditions to which approval of the programme was made subject, on the basis of an examination of the  periodic summary reports provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86, or in the absence thereof.", "The Commission draws attention to the fact that the investment estimates contained in this programme are without prejudice to any financial aid the Community may grant.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 1991.
