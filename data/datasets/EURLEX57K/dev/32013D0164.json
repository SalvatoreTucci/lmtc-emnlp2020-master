By those Decisions, the plans for the eradication of classical swine fever and the emergency vaccination of feral pigs against that disease were approved for those Member States.\n(2) Commission Implementing Decision 2012/761/EU of 30 November 2012 approving annual and multiannual programmes and the financial contribution from the Union for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses presented by the Member States for 2013\u00a0(5) approves, inter alia, the programmes for the control and monitoring of classical swine fever submitted by Germany and Slovakia.\n(3) In 2011 France and Slovakia informed the Commission and the Member States of the favourable classical swine fever situation in their territory. The information provided indicated that classical swine fever had been successfully eradicated from the feral pigs in the affected areas of those Member States. In addition, in 2012, Germany informed the Commission and the Member States that classical swine fever was successfully eradicated from the feral pigs in the affected areas of that Member State.\n(4) According to the information submitted by France, Germany and Slovakia, the emergency vaccination of feral pigs was stopped. In addition, a high level of surveillance in the areas previously affected by the disease is maintained as part of the programmes approved by Implementing Decision 2012/761/EU. The measures provided for in the plans for the eradication of classical swine fever and the emergency vaccination of feral pigs against classical swine fever approved for those Member States are therefore no longer necessary.\n(5) For reasons of clarity and consistency of Union legislation, Decisions 2003/135/EC, 2004/832/EC and 2005/59/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decisions 2003/135/EC, 2004/832/EC and 2005/59/EC are repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic and the Slovak Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 1.12.2001, p. 5.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 53, 28.2.2003, p. 47.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 359, 4.12.2004, p. 62.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 27.1.2005, p. 46.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 8.12.2012, p. 83."}
