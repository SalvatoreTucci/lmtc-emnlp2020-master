The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance was defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases\u00a0(2).\n(2) The Government of Poland has requested the Commission to authorise three methods for grading pig carcases and has submitted the results of its dissection trials which were executed before the day of accession, by presenting part two of the protocol provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\n(3) The evaluation of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising these grading methods are fulfilled.\n(4) Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 lays down that Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation defined in the same Article where commercial practice or technical requirements warrant such a derogation.\n(5) In Poland the traditions in carcase presentation, and consequently, commercial practice, necessitate that carcases can be presented with the flare fat, kidneys and/or diaphragm. This should be taken into account in adjusting the weight recorded to the weight for standard presentation.\n(6) No modification of the apparata or grading methods may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained; for this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is hereby authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in Poland:\n(a) the apparatus termed \u2018Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\u2019 and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex;\n(b) the apparatus termed \u2018Ultra FOM 300\u2019 and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in part 2 of the Annex;\n(c) the apparatus called \u2018Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading (Autofom)\u2019 and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in part 3 of the Annex.\nAs regards the apparatus \u2018Ultra FOM 300\u2019, referred in the first paragraph, point (b), it is laid down that after the end of the measurement procedure it must be possible to verify on the carcase that the apparatus measured the values of measurement T1 and T2 on the site provided for in the Annex, part 2, point 3.

Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018Capteur gras/maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a high-definition Sydel probe 8 mm in width, a light-emitting infra-red diode (Honeywell) and two light sensors (Honeywell). The operating distance is between 0 and 105 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX1 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last rib,\nX2 = the thickness of the muscle in millimetres measured at the same time and in the same place as X1.\nPart 2\nULTRA-FOM 300\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Ultra-FOM 300\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 3,5 MHz (Krautkr\u00e4mer MB 4 SE). The ultrasonic signal is digitised, stored and processed by a microprocessor.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nT1 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, at the last rib,\nT2 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last rib,\nM1 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as T1,\nM2 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as T2.\nPart 3\nFULLY AUTOMATIC ULTRASONIC CARCASE GRADING (AUTOFOM)\n1. Pig carcase grading shall be carried out using the apparatus termed Autofom (Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading).\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 16,2 MHz ultrasonic transducers (Krautkr\u00e4mer, SFK 2 NP), with an operating distance between transducers of 25 mm.\n3. The carcase's lean meat content shall be calculated on the basis of 55 measurement points using the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\n4. Descriptions of the measurement points and the statistical method can be found in part II of the Polish protocol forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85."}
