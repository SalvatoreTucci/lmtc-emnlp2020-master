It should therefore be abolished.\n(4) To achieve simplification, the adjustment of measures in the apiculture programmes during a year should be made more flexible; the limits on a new budgetary allocation by type of measure within the budget allocated to each Member State should therefore be abolished.\n(5) There should be provision for adjustments to the measures in the apiculture programmes to be notified to the Commission where certain measures were not notified in the three-year programme forwarded initially.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 917/2004 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 917/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
