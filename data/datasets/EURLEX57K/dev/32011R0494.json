Directive 76/769/EEC was repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 with effect from 1 June 2009.\n(5) In 2007 the European risk assessment on cadmium\u00a0(4) under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances\u00a0(5) was completed. On 14 June 2008 the Commission published a Communication on the results of the risk evaluation and the risk reduction strategies for cadmium and cadmium oxide\u00a0(6) which recommended a marketing and use restriction for cadmium in brazing sticks and jewellery.\n(6) The Communication outlined the need for specific measures to limit the risks from the use of cadmium-containing brazing sticks and from wearing cadmium-containing jewellery. Professionals and hobbyists are exposed to fumes in the process of brazing. Consumers including children are exposed to cadmium in jewellery through skin contact or licking.\n(7) The Commission has commissioned a study on Socio-Economic Impact of a Potential Update of the Restrictions on the Marketing and Use of Cadmium in jewelleries, brazing alloys and PVC. The results of the study were published in January 2010\u00a0(7).\n(8) The existing provisions concerning paint containing zinc should be clarified to define high zinc content. Provisions concerning paint on painted articles should be also clarified.\n(9) Since 2001 the European PVC industry has taken the initiative on a voluntary basis to refrain from using cadmium as a stabiliser in newly produced PVC for those applications which were not yet regulated under Directive 76/769/EEC. This voluntary initiative eventually led to a phase out of the use of cadmium in PVC.\n(10) The prohibition of the use of cadmium should be extended to all articles made from PVC in order to comply with the objective of combating cadmium pollution.\n(11) A derogation for mixtures produced from PVC waste and referred to as \u2018recovered PVC\u2019 should be granted to allow their placing on the market for use in certain construction products.\n(12) The use of recovered PVC should be encouraged in the manufacture of certain construction products because it allows the reuse of old PVC, which may contain cadmium. Consequently a higher limit value for cadmium should be granted for these construction products. This avoids PVC being discarded in landfills or incinerated causing release of carbon dioxide and cadmium in the environment.\n(13) This Regulation should apply 6 months after the entry into force to allow operators to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.\n(14) It is foreseen that due to the prohibition of cadmium in new PVC, the content of cadmium in construction products manufactured from recovered PVC should diminish gradually. Therefore, the limit value for cadmium should be reviewed accordingly and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) should be involved in reviewing the restriction as provided for in Article 69 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n(15) In accordance with the provisions on transitional measures in Article 137(1)a of REACH it is necessary to amend Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 30, 4.2.1988, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 262, 27.9.1976, p. 201.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ecb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/Existing-chemicals/RISK_ASSESSMENT/REPORT/cdmetalreport303.pdf\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 84, 5.4.1993, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 149, 14.6.2008, p. 6.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/markrestr/study-cadmium_en.pdf\nANNEX\nIn Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the table setting out the designation of the substances, groups of substances and mixtures and the conditions of restriction is amended as follows:\n1. in the second column of entry 23, paragraphs 1 to 4 are replaced by the following:\n\u20181.
