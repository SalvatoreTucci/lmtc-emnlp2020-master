By Decision 2007/627/EC\u00a0(5) the Council decided to denounce, on behalf of the Community, the ACP Protocol with effect from 1 October 2009. The delivery period starting on 1 July 2009 will therefore only last for 3 months.\n(3) Application of Articles 3 and 7 of the ACP Protocol, Articles 3 and 7 of the Agreement with India and Article 12(3) and Articles 14 and 15 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0950/2006 has resulted in the Commission calculating delivery obligations for each exporting country for the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009, on the basis of the information currently available.\n(4) For the delivery period which runs between 1 July 2009 and 30 September 2009, sufficient time should be given to operators to organise the trade. It is therefore necessary to provisionally determine the delivery obligations for the period beginning on 1 July 2009 in accordance with point (a) of Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0950/2006.\n(5) Trading contracts between Community importers and ACP countries and India are linked to delivery periods. In order to respect the chronology of the deliveries, applications for import licences for the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009 should not be submitted before 4 May 2009 unless it can be established that the exporting country met its delivery obligation for the 2008/09 delivery period as set out by Commission Regulation (EC) No 403/2008\u00a0(6).\n(6) In accordance with Article 153(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, import licences for sugar for refining are to be issued only to full-time refiners provided that the quantities concerned do not exceed the quantities that may be imported in the framework of the traditional supply need referred to in Article 153(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. However, pursuant to Article 155 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the Commission may adopt measures derogating from Article 153(3) of that Regulation in order to ensure that the ACP/Indian sugar is imported into the Community under the conditions set out in the ACP Protocol and the Agreement with India. For the delivery period starting on 1 July 2009 and taking into account the price reduction of imported raw cane sugar on 1 October 2009, those conditions can only be fulfilled if all traders can have access to import licences for sugar for refining. It is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0950/2006 which limits the submission of applications for sugar for refining to full-time refiners.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The delivery obligations for imports originating in the countries that are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India are provisionally determined as set out in the Annex. The amounts are fixed for each exporting country concerned in respect of products falling within CN code 1701, expressed in white-sugar equivalent, in the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009.", "By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, the first period of submission for import licence applications shall start on 4 May 2009.
