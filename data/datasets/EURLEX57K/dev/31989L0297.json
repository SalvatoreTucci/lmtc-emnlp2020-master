Every vehicle of categories N2, N3, O3 and O4 shall be so constructed and /or equipped as to offer, when a complete entity, effective protection to unprotected road users (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists) against the risk of falling under the sides of the vehicle and being caught under the wheels\u00a0(1).\n\u2014 tractors for semi-trailers,\n\u2014 trailers specially designed and constructed for the carriage of very long loads of indivisible length, such as timber, steel bars, etc.,\n\u2014 vehicles designed and constructed for special purposes where it is not possible, for practical reasons, to fit such lateral protection.\n1.2. A vehicle shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement set out in point 1.1 if its side parts provide protection conforming to the provisions of the paragraphs below.\n1.3.\n1.3.1. Vehicle type for the purposes of lateral protection\n1.3.2. \u2018Unladen mass\u2019 means the weight of the vehicle in running order, unoccupied and unladen but complete with fuel coolant, lubricant tools and spare wheel, if supplied by the vehicle manufacturer as standard equipment.\n1.4. When tested for compliance with the technical specifications set out in point 2, the position of the vehicle shall be as fallows:\n\u2014 on a horizontal and flat surface,\n\u2014 the steered wheels shall be in a straight-ahead position,\n\u2014 the vehicle shall be unladen,\n\u2014 semi-trailers shall be positioned on their supports with the loading survace horizontal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lateral protection provided by a specific device (side guard)\n2.1. The device shall not increase the overall width of the vehicle and the main part of its outer surface shall not be more than 120 mm inboard from the outermost plane (maximum width) of the vehicle. Its forward end may be turned inwards on some vehicles in accordance with points 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. Its rearward end shall not be more than 30 mm inboard from the outermost edge of the rear tyres (excluding any bulging of the tyres close to the ground) over at least the rearmost 250 mm.\n2.2. The outer surface of the device shall be smooth, substantially flat or horizontally corrugated and so far as possible continuous from front to rear; adjacent parts may however overlap, provided that the overlapping edge faces rearwards or downwards, or a gap of not more than 25 mm measured longitudinally may be left, provided that the rearward part does not protrude outboard of the forward part; domed heads of bolts or rivets may protrude beyond the surface to a distance not exceeding 10 mm and other parts may protrude to the same extent provided that they are smooth and similarly rounded; all external edges and corners shall be rounded with a radius not less than 2,5 mm (tested as prescribed in Directive 74/483/EEC\u00a0(2)).\n2.3. The device may consist of a continuous flat surface, or of one or more horizontal rails, or a combination of surface and rails; when rails are used, they shall be not more than 300 mm apart and not less than:\n\u2014 50 mm high in the case of category N2 and O3 vehicles,\n\u2014 100 mm high and essentially flat in the case of N3 and O4 vehicles. Combinations of surfaces and rails shall form a continuous side guard subject, however, to the provisions of point 2.2.\n2.4. The forward edge of the side guard shall be constructed as follows:\n2.4.1. Its position shall be:\n2.4.1.1. on a motor vehicle: not more than 300 mm to the rear of the transverse vertical plane tangential to the rearmost part of the tyre on the wheel immediately forward of the guard;\n2.4.1.2. on a drawbar trailer: not more than 500 mm to the rear of the plane defined in point 2.4.1.1;\n2.4.1.3. on a semi-trailer: not more than 250 mm to the rear of the transverse median plane of the support legs, if support legs are fitted, but in any case the distance of the front edge to the transverse plane passing through the centre of the kingpin in its rearmost position may not exceed 2,7 m.\n2.4.2. Where the forward edge lies in otherwise open space, the edge shall consist of a continuous vertical member extending over the whole height of the guard; the outer and forward faces of this member shall measure at least 50 mm rearward and be turned 100 mm inwards in the case of N2 and O3 and at least 100 mm rearwards and be turned 100 mm inwards in the case of N3 and O4.\n2.4.3. On a motor vehicle where the 300 mm-dimension referred to in point 2.4.1.1 falls within the cab, the guard shall be so constructed as to meet the cab panels and if necessary be turned in through an angle not exceeding 45o. A longitudinal gap of 100 mm shall be permitted between the forward edge and the cab panels in the case of suspended or tilt cabs. In this case, the provisions of point 2.4.2 are not applicable.\n2.4.4. On a motor vehicle where the 300 mm dimension referred to in point 2.4.1.1 falls behind the cab and the side guard is extended forward as indicated in point 2.4.3. as an option to the manufacturer, the provisions of point 2.4.3 must be met.\n2.5. The rearward edge of the side guard shall not be more than 300 mm forward of the transverse vertical plane tangential to the foremost part of the tyre on the wheel immediately to the rear; a continuous vertical member is not required on the rear edge.\n2.6. The lower edge of the side guard shall at no point be more than 550 mm above the ground.\n2.7. The upper edge of the guard shall not be more than 350 mm below that part of the structure of the vehicle, cut or contacted by a vertical plane tangential to the outer surface of the tyres, excluding any bulging close to the ground, except in the following cases:\n2.7.1. where the plane in point 2.7 does not cut the structure of the vehicle, the upper edge shall be level with the surface of the load-carrying platform, of 950 mm from the ground, whichever is the less;\n2.7.2. where the plane in point 2.7 cuts the structure of the vehicle at a level more than 1.3 m above the ground, then the upper edge of the side guard shall not be less than 950 mm above the ground;\n2.7.3. on a vehicle specially designed and constructed, and not merely adapted, for the carriage of a container or demountable body, the upper edge of the guard may be determined in accordance with points 2.7.1 and 2.7.2, the container or body being considered as part of the vehicle.\n2.8. Side guards shall be essentially rigid, securely mounted (they shall not be liable to loosening due to vibration in normal use of the vehicle) and, except as regards the parts listed in point 2.9, made of metal or any other suitable material.\n\u2014 30 mm over the rearmost 250 mm of the guard, and\n\u2014 150 mm over the remainder of the guard.\n2.8.1. The above requirement may be checked by means of calculations.\n2.9. Components permanently fixed to the vehicle, e.g. battery box, air tanks, fuel tanks, lamps, reflectors, spare wheels and tool boxes, may be incorporated in the side guard, provided that they meet the dimensional requirements of the Directive. As regards gaps, the requirements set out in point 2.2 shall apply.\n2.10. The side guard may not be used for the attachment of brake, air or hydraulic pipes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By derogation from the above provisions, vehicles of the following types need comply only as indicated in each case:\n3.1. An extendible trailer shall comply with all of the requirements of point 2, when closed to its minimum length; when the trailer is extended, the side guards shall comply with points 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8, and with either 2.4 or 2.5 but not necessarily both; extension of the trailer shall not produce gaps in the length of the side guards;\n3.2. a tank-vehicle that is a vehicle designed solely for the carriage of fluid substance in a closed tank permanently fitted to the vehicle and provided with hose or pipe connections for loading or unloading, shall be fitted with side guards which comply so far as is practicable with all the requirements of point 2; strict compliance may be waived only where operational requirements make this necessary;\n3.3. On a vehicle fitted with extendible legs to provide additional stability during loading, unloading or other operations for which the vehicle is designed, the side guard may be arranged with additional gaps where these are necessary to permit extension of the legs.\n3.4. On a vehicle equipped with anchorage points for ro-ro transport, gaps shall be permitted within the side guard to accept the passage and tensioning of fixing lashings.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the sides of the vehicle are so designed and/or equipped that by their shape and characteristics their component parts together meet the requirements of point 2, they may be regarded as replacing the side guards.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Application for EEC type-approval\n5.1. The application for EEC type-approval of a vehicle type with respect to lateral protection shall be submitted by the vehicle manufacturer or his authorized representative.\n5.2. It must be accompanied by the undermentioned documents in triplicate and the following information:\n5.2.1. a description of the vehicle from the standpoint of the criteria referred to in point 1.4.1, together with dimensional drawings and either photographs or exploded views of the sides of the vehicle. The numbers and/or symbols identifying the vehicle type must be quoted;\n5.2.2. a technical description of the parts providing lateral protection together with sufficiently detailed information.\n5.3. a vehicle representative of the type to be approved must be submitted to the technical service responsible for the type-approval tests.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EEC type-approval\n6.1. The EEC type-approval certificate for the vehicle type must be accompanied by an Annex drawn up in conformity with the model shown in the Appendix.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0This Directive does not prevent any country from having additional requirements for the vehicle parts forward of the front wheels and rearward of the rear wheels.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 266, 2. 10. 1974, p. 4.\nAppendix"}
