This Decision provides that it shall be reviewed on the basis of the information provided by Chinese competent authorities, any results from the increased monitoring and testing carried out by Member States on consignments arriving before 14 March 2002 and, if necessary, on the results of an on-the-spot inspection visit by Community experts.\n(4) Following the information provided by the Chinese authorities and the favourable results of the tests carried out on certain crustaceans caught in the Atlantic Ocean, in certain fishery products of some fish species and in gelatin, imports of these products from China should be authorised. However, since the presence of chloramphenicol has been detected in fishery products of the species Alaska pollack, cod and redfish, it is necessary to ensure their safety, and to foresee a transitional period until 30 September 2002, during which the imports of these products shall be subjected to intensified monitoring and testing of a 20 % of the consignments arriving to the Community border inspection post.\n(5) Since the presence of chloramphenicol has also been detected in casings imported from China, it is necessary to subject the imports of this product to the same intensified monitoring and testing provided for the fishery products of the species Alaska pollack, cod and redfish.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4) sets up the Rapid Alert System for food and feed, and recourse to it is appropriate for implementing the mutual information requirement laid down in Directive 97/78/EC.\n(7) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of information and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of China and on the basis of the results of the tests carried out by Member States.\n(8) Decision 2002/69/EC should, therefore, be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/69/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
