For 19 of those substances, the persons responsible for placing the flavouring substances on the market have now withdrawn their applications. Therefore, those flavouring substances should be removed from the Union list.\n(5) Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 flavouring substances not included in the Union list may be placed on the market as such and used in or on food until 22 October 2014. Since flavouring substances are already on the market in the Member States and in order to ensure smooth transition to a Union authorisation procedure, transitional measures have been laid down for food containing those substances in Commission Regulation (EU) No 873/2012\u00a0(4).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 34.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 872/2012 of 1 October 2012 adopting the list of flavouring substances provided for by Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council, introducing it in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000 and Commission Decision 1999/217/EC (OJ L 267, 2.10.2012, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 873/2012 of 1 October 2012 on transitional measures concerning the Union list of flavourings and source materials set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 267, 2.10.2012, p. 162).\nANNEX\nIn Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008, the following entries are deleted:\n\u201801.015 Vinylbenzene 100-42-5  11022   1 EFSA\n02.122 p-Mentha-1,8(10)-dien-9-ol 3269-90-7     2 EFSA\n09.809 p-Mentha-1,8(10)-dien-9-yl acetate 15111-97-4  10743   2 EFSA\n12.114 Diethyl trisulfide 3600-24-6 1701 11451   4 EFSA\n12.120 2,8-Epithio-p-menthane 68398-18-5 1685    4 EFSA\n12.159 Methyl methanethiosulfonate 2949-92-0  11520   3 EFSA\n12.256 Ethyl propyl trisulfide 31499-70-4 1695    4 EFSA\n12.272 Propyl propanethiosulfonate 1113-13-9 1702    3 EFSA\n13.029 2,5-Dimethylfuran 625-86-5 1488 2208   3 EFSA\n13.030 2-Methylfuran 534-22-5 1487 2209   3 EFSA\n13.092 2-Ethylfuran 3208-16-0 1489 11706   3 EFSA\n14.145 Pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 1003-29-8  11393   4 EFSA\n14.163 1-Methylpyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 1192-58-1     4 EFSA\n14.169 1-Ethyl-2-pyrrolecarboxaldehyde 2167-14-8     4 EFSA\n15.064 2,5-Dimethylthiophene 638-02-8     4 EFSA\n15.072 2-Ethylthiophene 872-55-9  11614   4 EFSA\n15.091 2-Methylthiophene 554-14-3  11631   4 EFSA\n15.092 3-Methylthiophene 616-44-4  11632   4 EFSA\n16.124 (1R,2S,5R)-N-cyclopropyl-5-methyl-2-isopropyl cyclohexanecarboxamide 73435-61-7     1 EFSA\u2019"}
