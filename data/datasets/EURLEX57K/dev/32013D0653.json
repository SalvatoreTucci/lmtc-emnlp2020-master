The Commission therefore laid down detailed rules for harmonised monitoring and reporting of AMR in accordance with Article 7(3) of Directive 2003/99/EC to be carried out by the Member States in Commission Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU\u00a0(4).\n(5) This harmonised monitoring must be performed in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 ensuring that official controls are carried out regularly, on a risk basis and with appropriate frequency, so as to achieve the objectives of that Regulation taking account of identified risks associated with animals, feed or food, feed or food businesses, the use of feed or food or any process, material, substance, activity or operation that may influence feed or food safety, animal health or animal welfare.\n(6) In order to facilitate smooth and fast application of this monitoring, the Union should financially support the Member States which carry out this monitoring at the most appropriate level as provided for in Article 66(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n(7) In accordance with Article 84 of the Financial Regulation and Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012\u00a0(5), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.\n(8) The measures eligible for Union financial support are defined within the current Implementing Decision.\n(9) The financial contribution from the Union should be granted subject to the condition that the tests and analyses have been carried out in accordance with the present Implementing Decision and with Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU and that the competent authorities supply all the necessary information within the time limits laid down in the present Implementing Decision.\n(10) For reasons of administrative efficiency all expenditure submitted for a financial contribution by the Union should be expressed in euro and the conversion rate for expenditure in a currency other than the euro should be set,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe Union shall contribute to the costs incurred by the Member States relating to the application of the harmonised antimicrobial resistance monitoring in accordance with Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU on samples of poultry collected between 1 January and 31 December 2014, with a total maximum amount of EUR 1\u00a0407\u00a0585 to be financed from line 17\u00a004\u00a007\u00a001.", "Eligible costs\nThe Union financial contribution:\n(a) shall be at a rate of 50\u00a0% of the costs incurred by each Member State to implement the monitoring referred to in Article 1 of Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU and performed by the competent authority;\n(b) shall not exceed the following:\n(i) EUR 8 for staff costs per caecal sampling;\n(ii) EUR 11 per E. coli isolation and identification;\n(iii) EUR 21,5 per Campylobacter isolation and identification;\n(iv) EUR 15 per antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of each Salmonella or E. coli isolate;\n(v) EUR 15 per AST of each Campylobacter isolate;\n(vi) EUR 17,5 per characterisation and classification of Salmonella or E. coli isolates showing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and meropenem;\n(vii) EUR 22 per Salmonella serotyping;\n(viii) the maximum amounts indicated in Annex I;\n(c) only the costs indicated in Annex II shall be eligible for contribution.", "Eligibility rules\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union contribution is subject to the following conditions:\n(a) by 31 May 2015, the Member States have provided to the European Food Safety Authority who was mandated for this task by the European Commission, with a technical report covering at least the information requested in Part B of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU;\n(b) by 31 May 2015, the Member States have provided the Commission, in electronic form, with a financial report according to the format laid out in Annex III to this Decision.
