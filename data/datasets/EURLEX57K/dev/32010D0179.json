BLANCO\nANNEX\nEU CONTRIBUTION TO SEESAC PROJECT ON SALW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\nThe large-scale accumulation of small arms and light weapons (SALW) in south-east Europe has been recognised as an important challenge to peace and security by the EU SALW Strategy. The countries in the Western Balkans have been of a particular concern due to the historical accumulation of weapons and munitions stockpiles. Not only does this region remain directly affected by the proliferation of SALW and their ammunition, but it also continues to present risks of trafficking of weapons to conflict areas elsewhere.\nCurrently the main challenge for the Western Balkan countries is the practical implementation of their legal and political commitments in the area of SALW control, including the UN Programme of Action on SALW and the International Marking and Tracing Instrument (ITI).\nConsequently, in order to minimise the risk of proliferation of SALW, it is crucial to increase safety of existing stockpiles of SALW and ammunitions, to destroy surpluses and to establish more stringent controls on SALW, including through the implementation at regional level of the ITI and improvement of the registration process. These objectives and activities are in line with those laid down in the EU SALW Strategy. SEESAC proposes to conduct projects relating to these three areas of activities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project description\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Improved stockpile management\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regional training modules on SALW stockpile management\nIn order to assist in increasing the safety and security of stockpiles of weapons and ammunition, the project envisages the development of three learning modules for officials responsible for material resources in the Ministries of Defence and the Ministries of Interior of countries in the Western Balkans. The course will be offered to the inspection teams and officers in order to help familiarise them with best practices in stockpile management techniques.\nThe implementation of the project will result in increased awareness of international standards and best practices in stockpile management. The level and quality of implementation stockpile management procedures will be enhanced, thus increasing the safety and security of stockpiles.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Improved safety and security at SALW and ammunition storage sites\nThe project will improve the safety and security of weapons and ammunition storage sites in the Western Balkans by providing specific technical and infrastructure assistance in order to enhance safe storage capacities. The project activities will assist the Ministries of Defence in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro as well as the Ministry of the Interior of Croatia in procuring and installing the necessary equipment for securing weapons and ammunition stockpiles. Training will be provided for staff in charge of stockpile management.\nThe project will result in increased security provisions and access control at the selected sites, thus improving the safety of ammunition stocks. As a consequence the risk of theft and of uncontrolled explosions will be significantly reduced through better control of the state of the ammunition and weapons.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SALW destruction\nThe objective of the project is to increase security and diminish the risk of proliferation by significantly reducing the number of surplus weapons in storage. In order to reduce the surplus SALW held by the Ministries of Interior in Croatia and Serbia, the project will conduct several SALW destruction activities. In Croatia, the project envisages the destruction of some 30\u00a0000 weapons. In Serbia, the number of weapons to be destroyed is estimated at 40\u00a0000.\nThe project will result in a significantly reduced number of surplus and confiscated SALW in the Ministry of Interior storages in Croatia and Serbia. The destruction of recovered weapons will significantly contribute to preventing further proliferation of SALW. In addition, this will lead to improved security as well as increased awareness of SALW issues in these two countries.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increased controls on SALW\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development of national weapons registration and record-keeping systems\nThe project will provide for the development or upgrade of the existing systems for weapons registration, licensing and record-keeping. The registration systems will include operations related to keeping track of firearms owned by an individual and/or legal entity and the amount of ammunition it is authorised to possess. The support for record-keeping will include development of software product/s that identify not only the weapons in civilian possession but also operations related to the management of weapons, ammunition and/or explosives in depots, approved warehouses or armouries, such as a local police station or central storage site. It will thus be possible to identify weapons, the users and the storage location of equipment, when not in use. The project activities will also provide for adequate technical infrastructure for the implementation of the weapons registration software.\nThe development and establishment of electronic system(s) for weapons registration and record-keeping will result in the implementation of the requirements for registration and record-keeping established under the UN Firearms Protocol and the ITI.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection and registration of weapons\nThe project aims at supporting the collection of any weapon, explosive device, ordnance and associated ammunition, including through the legalisation of weapons in civilian possession through their registration.\nThe awareness-raising actions will be coordinated by committees consisting of specialists of the Ministries of Interior and UNDP/SEESAC, joined by relevant other PR experts where necessary, in order to properly disseminate details about the legalisation and voluntary surrender of illegal firearms. The campaigns will focus on local dissemination channels that are able to reach the local level most effectively. Local information dissemination will be reinforced at the national level through reporting, interviews, and documentaries. Information on the campaigns will be provided through electronic and written media. The campaign messages will be positive and show law implementation in practice.\nThe project will enhance security across the Western Balkans by taking dangerous weapons off the streets through a two-way communication between the public and the police. In particular, the project will reach all age-groups in possession of illegal weapons and all those who intend to acquire weapons.\n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regional seminar on marking and tracing\nThe project provides for the organisation of a two-day regional seminar provisionally envisaged to be held in Belgrade, Serbia. The seminar will provide an update on adherence to international instruments and the adoption of national legislation on marking and tracing in the Western Balkans. The seminar will provide for a review of the implementation of the national legislation. A specific objective will be the implementation of the requirement for marking of imported weapons under the UN Firearms Protocol.\nParticipants in this regional seminar will include, inter alia, representatives from the Western Balkan\u2019s countries, international organisations and NGOs, national industries and technical experts from EU Member States. It is expected that up to 50 participants will attend this seminar.\nThe seminar will produce a report of the presentations and discussions and of the recommendations. The seminar documents will be made available online.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Duration\nThe total estimated duration of the project will be 24 months.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beneficiaries\nThe beneficiaries of the project are the national institutions in Western Balkan countries responsible for arms control and stockpile management.\nThe general population of the countries within the Western Balkans will benefit from the project due to the reduced risk of insecurity and instability from the widespread proliferation of SALW."}
