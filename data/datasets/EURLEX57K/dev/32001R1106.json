Since the immediate termination of these measures would very likely have a negative effect on local production, it is necessary to ensure the continuity of the said treatments. The period of application of Regulation (EEC) No 3621/92 and Regulation (EC) No 527/96 should therefore be extended until 31 December 2001.\n(6) Once the abovementioned evaluation is terminated, the Commission will make, if necessary, a new proposal taking into account the aims of Article 299(2) of the Treaty,", "main_body": ["1.
