National financial assistance should be directly linked to the production in those regions. Therefore, it should be clarified in Article 93 of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 that only products of the fruit and vegetable sector produced in regions where the degree of organisation of producers in the fruit and vegetable sector is particularly low may benefit from national financial assistance.\n(4) The second subparagraph of Article 94(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 concerns the information that should be accompanied in a Member State\u2019s request for national financial assistance. It is appropriate to require Member States that submit such a request to prove that the assistance is only granted for production that originates in the region where the degree of organisation of producers in the fruit and vegetable sector is particularly low, especially where producer organisations operating on its territory are active in more than one region.\n(5) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1943/2003\u00a0(3) allowed producer groups to include processing aids in the value of marketed production. This principle should be maintained for producer groups which were granted preliminary recognition under Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96\u00a0(4) until processing aids systems are phased out. It is appropriate that producer groups referred to in Article 203a(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 may continue to calculate processing aids received on the basis of Commission Regulations (EC) No 1621/1999\u00a0(5), (EC) No 1622/1999\u00a0(6), (EC) No 1535/2003\u00a0(7) and (EC) No 2111/2003\u00a0(8) into their sales. Such producer groups should be allowed to lodge an additional application for the aid referred to in Article 103a(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to be calculated on the basis of this additional value of marketed production if these processing aid were not taken into account in the earlier standard applications. It is appropriate to lay down the rules for calculating the aid referred to in Article 103a(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards producer groups in Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 or thereafter with annual segments of recognition plans that started in 2007 and ended in 2008.\n(6) Following the reform of the common organisation of the fruit and vegetables sector, certain culinary herbs are since 1 January 2008 subject to the rules applicable to this sector. As a result, from that 1 January 2008 onwards, Member States may recognise as producer organisations operators that are specialised in, or which production includes, the culinary herbs listed in Part IX of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, including: saffron, thyme, fresh or chilled, basil, melissa, mint, origanum vulgare (oregano/wild marjoram), rosemary and sage, fresh or chilled. However, the application of Article 53(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 to producer organisations which members started producing culinary herbs before 2008 resulted in a strict and short period for the inclusion of the value of these products into the value of the marketed production for the operational programmes for 2008 and 2009. It is therefore appropriate to allow producer organisations to include the value of those products into the value of the marketed production for operational programmes implemented in 2008 and 2009.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
