REGULATION (EEC) No 1756/93 of 30 June 1993 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 introduces new agrimonetary arrangements from 1 January 1993; whereas, under these arrangements, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural  conversion rates (2) establishes the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates applicable after the transitional measures provided for in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 (3) without prejudice to any detailed rules to be  laid down for the sectors concerned and in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92; whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to fix the specific operative events for the agricultural conversion rates applicable  after the transitional measures provided for in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 in the milk and milk products sector without prejudice to the possibilities for advance fixing providing for in Articles 13 to 17 of Regulation (EEC) No  1068/93;\nWhereas the principal criteria to be observed for fixing the operative events are, firstly, the attainment of the economic objective of the operation concerned and, secondly, the need to prevent distortions of competition and disturbance of the market;  whereat it is possible, therefore, to fix operative events which stabilize the agricultural conversion rates for flat-rate aids and the amounts directly affecting milk producers which do not have a direct impact on the market price;\nWhereas the provisions of Article 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should be applied for the purchase and sales prices applicable to milk and milk products;\nWhereas the operative event should be fixed as the first day of the month in which the first check is carried out guaranteeing the planned use of products for which specific aid is granted for their use or processing pursuant to Article 10 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93;\nWhereas the operative event referred to in Article 10 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should be applied for private storage aid;\nWhereas the operative event for securities should be fixed as the day on which the security is lodged pursuant to Article 12 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93;\nWhereas certain definitions should be drawn up in order to guarantee the uniform application of the operative events established;\nWhereas steps should be taken to repeal or amend, upon the
