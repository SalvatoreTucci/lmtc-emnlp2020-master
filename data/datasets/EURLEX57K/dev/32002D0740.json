That review is to result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.\n(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 98/634/EC of 2 October 1998 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to bed mattresses(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Commission Decision 2001/540/EC(3) and the definition of the product group should be amended.\n(5) A new Commission Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.\n(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 18 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria established by Decision 98/634/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,", "main_body": ["In order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a bed mattress must fall within the product group \"bed mattresses\" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "1. The product group \"bed mattresses\" shall comprise:\n(a) bed mattresses within the meaning of paragraph 2;\n(b) latex foam for use in bed mattresses;\n(c) polyurethane foam for use in bed mattresses.\n2. \"Bed mattresses\" means products providing a surface to sleep or rest upon, consisting of a strong cloth cover filled with materials, and that can be placed on an existing supporting bed structure.\nThis includes framed sprung mattresses, which are defined as an upholstered bed base consisting of springs, topped with fillings, on a rigid frame to be used in a bed frame or free standing, combined with a mattress pad which is not intended to be used separately.\nInflatable mattresses and water mattresses are excluded.", "For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group \"bed mattresses\" shall be \"014\".", "Article 3 of Decision 98/634/EC is replaced by the following: \"Article 3\nThe product group definition and the specific ecological criteria for the product group shall be valid until 31 January 2004.\"", "This Decision shall apply from 1 September 2002 until 31 August 2007.\nProducers of products falling within the product group \"bed mattresses\" which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 September 2002 may continue to use that label until 31 January 2004.\nProducers of products falling within the product group \"bed mattresses\" which have already applied for the award of the eco-label before 1 September 2002 may be awarded the eco-label under the terms of Decision 98/634/EC.
