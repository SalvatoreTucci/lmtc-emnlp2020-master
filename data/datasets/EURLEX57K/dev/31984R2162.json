In Title II 'Quality requirements', the second subparagraph of A 'Minimum requirements' is replaced by the following:\n'The fruit must be sufficiently developed so that it can:\n- continue the ripening process in order to reach the degree of maturity appropriate to its varietal characteristics,\n- tolerate transport and handling, and\n- arrive at its destination in satisfactory condition.'\n2. In Title III 'Sizing':\n- the following footnote (2) is added to the end of the last sentence of the first subparagraph:\n'(2) However, for apples of the Bramley's Seedling variety (Bramley, Triomphe de Kiel) the difference in diameter may reach 10 mm.'\n- the following footnote (3) is added to the end of the second subparagraph:\n'(3) However, for apples of the Bramley's Seedling variety (Bramley, Triomphe de Kiel), the difference in diameter may reach 20 mm.'\n- footnote (2) in the fourth subparagraph becomes footnote (4).\n3. In Table A 'Colouring criteria for apples' 'Group C - Striped varieties, slightly coloured', the following footnote (1) is inserted after the variety Jonagold:\n'(1) However, for the variety Jonagold, at least one-tenth of the surface of fruit in Class II must be streaked with red colouring.'\n4.
