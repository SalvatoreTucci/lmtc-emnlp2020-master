However no seed companies participated because that Decision required a heterogeneity test to be carried out on every seed lot produced under the experiment involving large additional costs.\n(4) Current international practice, namely the ISTA (International Seed Testing Association)/ISF (International Seed Federation) Technical Protocol, approved by the ISTA Executive Committee on 10 February 2006, and adopted by the Council of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) on 24 May 2006 permit procedures whereby the maximum weight of a lot may be increased for grasses.\n(5) To test in practice the conditions under which production plants are able to produce sufficiently homogeneous large seed lots, a temporary experiment should be organised increasing the maximum weight of a lot of grasses.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and propagating material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 7(2) of Directive 66/401/EEC and Annex III to that Directive, for Member States participating in the temporary experiment and for seed of the species listed in column 1 of Annex III to that Directive under the heading \u2018GRAMINEAE\u2019 the maximum weight of a lot shall be 25 tonnes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Member States participating in the temporary experiment, the conditions set out in the Annex to this Decision shall apply in addition to the conditions provided for in Directive 66/401/EEC.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States participating in the experiment shall inform the Commission accordingly.
