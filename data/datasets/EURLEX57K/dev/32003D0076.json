This use of the assets is consistent with the resolution on growth and employment adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June 1997(3), and with the resolutions of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, of 20 July 1998(4) and 21 June 1999(5).\n(3) It is necessary to determine the distribution of the research appropriations between the two sectors concerned.\n(4) It is necessary to establish the rules for implementing the Protocol, and in particular the decision-making procedures for adopting the multiannual financial guidelines for managing the assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (hereinafter referred to as \"the programme\"), bearing in mind that unless otherwise provided in this Decision, the Commission is responsible for the management of the assets in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and secondary legislation adopted on the basis thereof.\n(5) When the ECSC Treaty expires, certain financial operations, involving both revenue and expenditure, will still be outstanding, resulting from the implementation of ECSC operating budgets for earlier years and ECSC borrowing and lending activities.\n(6) It is necessary to designate the institution responsible for winding-up these operations and establishing the procedures needed to do so. It would be appropriate to entrust the Commission with the winding-up and to decide that the procedures to be followed will be those in force at 23 July 2002, in accordance with the ECSC Treaty and secondary legislation.\n(7) At its meeting of 11 September 1996, the Commission concluded that reserves should be kept to cover, after 2002, 100 % of the outstanding loans not covered by a Member State guarantee. The ECSC funds administered totalled approximately EUR 1,6 billion on 23 July 2002. The amount will vary depending on the financial activities still to be carried out before and after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.\n(8) Where debtors default during the liquidation period after 23 July 2002 and in order to guarantee the annual stability of the coal and steel research Instrument, any default by an ECSC debtor should first be charged to the capital and then to the revenues funding research,", "main_body": ["1. The Commission shall be entrusted with winding-up the financial operations of the European Coal and Steel Community which are still in progress when the ECSC Treaty expires. Where an ECSC debtor defaults during the liquidation period, the resulting loss shall be charged first to the existing capital and then to the revenue of the current year. The Commission, before writing off any claim against an ECSC debtor in default, will exhaust all remedies including the call on guarantees (mortgages, cautions, bank guaranties or other). The Commission will reserve all possible actions in case that the debtor regains solvency.\n2.

It shall form the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and shall be managed by the Commission.\n2. The revenue referred to in paragraph 1 shall be distributed, 27,2 % being allocated to the coal-related research and 72,8 % to the steel-related research. Should it prove necessary, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall modify the breakdown between coal-related research and steel-related research.\n3. The multiannual technical guidelines for the programme shall be adopted by the Council acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.\n4.

INTRODUCTION\nNet revenue which may be used to finance research projects corresponds to the annual net result of the ECSC in liquidation and subsequently, when liquidation has been completed, to the annual net result of the Assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. The method employed consists of establishing the funding for coal and steel research for year n+2 when producing the balance sheet for year n, taking into account half of the increase or decrease in the net result in relation to the last level of funding adopted for coal and steel research.\n2. DEFINITION\nn: reference year\nRn: net result for year n\nPn: contingency provision for year n\nDn+1: allocation for research for year n+1 (established when the balance sheet for year n - 1 is produced)\nDn+2: allocation for research for year n+2\n3. ALGORITHMS USED\nThe algorithms used to establish the size of the contingency provision and the allocations for research for year n+2, which will appear in the balance sheet for year n, are as follows:\n3.1. size of contingency provision:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n3.2. allocations for research for year n+2 (rounded up or down to the nearest EUR 100000. If the calculation gives a result exactly halfway, the allocation shall be rounded up to the nearest EUR 100000):\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nWhere appropriate, the amount needed for rounding up (or the amount left over from rounding down) will be taken from (or returned to) the contingency provision."}
