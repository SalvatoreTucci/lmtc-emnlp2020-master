For chromafenozide the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2006/586/EC\u00a0(3).\n(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Hungary received on 12 December 2004 an application from Arysta LifeScience (formerly Calliope SAS) on behalf of Nippon Kayaku for the inclusion of the active substance chromafenozide in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2006/586/EC confirmed that the dossier was \u2018complete\u2019 in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 19 March 2012.\n(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance chromafenozide\u00a0(4) on 31 October 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed and finalised on 10 October 2014 in the format of the Commission review report for chromafenozide.\n(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing chromafenozide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve chromafenozide.\n(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing chromafenozide. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92\u00a0(5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\u00a0(6) should be amended accordingly.\n(11) It is also appropriate to allow Member States to extend provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing chromafenozide in order to provide them with the time necessary to fulfil the obligations set out in this Regulation as regards those provisional authorisations.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Approval of active substance\nThe active substance chromafenozide, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Re-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing chromafenozide as an active substance by 30 September 2015.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing chromafenozide as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances, all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 31 March 2015 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.
