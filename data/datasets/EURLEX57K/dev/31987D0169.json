Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Koed-Spaek-Automatisk (KSA)'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5 millimetres in diameter containing an electro-conductivity metre and having an operating distance of between 5 and 97 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y 1  // = 53,3671 + 0,0700x1 - 0,2260x2 - 0,2212x3 - 0,2721x4 + 0,1257x5   //   // where   // y 1  // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1  // = the cold weight of the carcase in kg,   // x2   // = the thickness of fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured on the midline of the split carcase at its thinnest point covering the lumbar muscle ('M. glutaeus medius'),   // x3   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured 8 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,   // x4   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measued 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x5   // = the thickness of the muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x4.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 100 kg."}
