That list should be amended so as to include other additives evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food.\n(3) For certain substances, the restrictions already established at Community level should be amended on the basis of the information available.\n(4) The current list of additives is an incomplete list inasmuch as it does not contain all the substances, which are currently accepted in one or more Member States. Accordingly, these substances continue to be regulated by national laws only pending a decision on inclusion in the Community list.\n(5) This Directive establishes specifications for only a few substances. The other substances, which may require specifications, therefore remain regulated in this respect by national laws only pending a decision at Community level.\n(6) Directive 90/128/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III, V and VI to Directive 90/128/EEC are amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 28 February 2003 at the latest, the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

However, for materials and articles which contain divinylbenzene and do not comply with the restriction set in this Directive, Member States shall prohibit their manufacture and importation into the Community as from 1 March 2003.\nWhen Member States adopt these provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
