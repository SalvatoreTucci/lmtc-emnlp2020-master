Those programmes were found to comply with relevant Community veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Commission Decision 2008/341/EC of 25 April 2008 laying down Community criteria for national programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses\u00a0(3). Those amended programmes should therefore be approved.\n(5) Denmark, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and the United Kingdom have submitted amended programmes for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).\n(6) The Commission has assessed those amended programmes from both the veterinary and the financial point of view. Those programmes were found to comply with relevant Community veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Decision 2008/341/EC. Those amended programmes should therefore be approved.\n(7) A multi-annual programme for the eradication of rabies was approved for Slovenia by Commission Decision 2007/782/EC of 30 November 2007 approving annual and multi-annual national programmes and the financial contribution from the Community for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses, presented by the Member States for 2008 and following years\u00a0(4). The second year of that programme was approved by Decision 2008/897/EC.\n(8) Slovenia has submitted an amended version of the programme for the second year of its multi-annual programme for the eradication of rabies. The Commission has assessed that amended programme from both the veterinary and the financial point of view. That programme was found to comply with relevant Community veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Decision 2008/341/EC. That amended programme should therefore be approved.\n(9) The national programmes for the eradication and monitoring of bluetongue approved by Decision 2008/897/EC included the vaccination campaigns against that disease in 2009. However, the costs of vaccine administration were not included in the costs eligible for a financial contribution by the Community.\n(10) In view of the epidemiological situation in the Member States concerned, it is appropriate to include the costs of the vaccine administration in the costs eligible for a financial contribution by the Community. Consequently, it is appropriate to allocate additional funds for the financing of the programmes for the eradication and monitoring of bluetongue in those Member States, approved by Decision 2008/897/EC.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(5), as recently amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 103/2009\u00a0(6), provides for more stringent requirements to be complied with in the case of milk producing flocks infected with classical scrapie.\n(12) On 18 March 2009 Cyprus has submitted a new, multi-annual, programme for the monitoring and eradication of scrapie, adapted to that recent amendment of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. That programme is to replace the national programme for the eradication of scrapie in that Member State for 2009, approved by Decision 2008/897/EC.\n(13) In view of this exceptional situation, Cyprus requested in the programme to obtain a financial participation above 50\u00a0% of the costs incurred in slaughtering animals infected with scrapie. The Commission has assessed that programme from both the veterinary and the financial point of view. That programme was found to comply with relevant Community veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Decision 2008/341/EC. That programme should therefore be approved.\n(14) Due to the fact that a very high proportion of the ovine and caprine flocks in Cyprus are infected with scrapie, Cyprus is obliged to cull an exceptionally high number of animals in a short period of time, in order to comply with the requirements of the relevant Community legislation.\n(15) In view of this exceptional situation, it is appropriate to provide for a higher level of Community contribution to the programme for the monitoring and eradication of scrapie in that Member State. In addition, the cost of personnel specifically hired for carrying out tasks within the programme and the cost of destroying the carcasses should be included in the costs eligible for a Community financial contribution under that programme.\n(16) The approval of the amended programmes by this Decision has an impact on the amounts needed for carrying out the programmes, as approved under Decision 2008/897/EC. The maximum amount of Community financial contribution for certain programmes should be adjusted accordingly.\n(17) Decision 2008/897/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(18) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The amended programmes for the monitoring of and eradication of bluetongue, submitted by Belgium on 29 January 2009, by Denmark on 20 April 2009, by Ireland on 16 February 2009, by Spain on 6 March 2009, by France on 2 February 2009, by Latvia on 20 February 2009, by Lithuania on 20 February 2009, by the Netherlands on 8 December 2008, by Portugal on 20 February 2009 and by Finland on 7 January 2009 are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009.", "The amended programmes for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies submitted by Denmark on 18 March 2009, by Spain on 7 April 2009, by Italy on 29 January 2009, by Luxembourg on 16 March 2009, by the Netherlands on 20 February 2009, by Portugal on 4 March 2009, by Finland on 27 February 2009 and by the United Kingdom on 26 January 2009 are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009.", "The second year of the multi-annual programme for the eradication of rabies, as amended, submitted by Slovenia on 23 April 2009 is hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009.", "Decision 2008/897/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4, paragraphs (2) and (3) are replaced by the following:\n(a) EUR\u00a04\u00a0450\u00a0000 for Belgium;\n(b) EUR\u00a05\u00a0000 for Bulgaria;\n(c) EUR\u00a02\u00a0350\u00a0000 for the Czech Republic;\n(d) EUR\u00a050\u00a0000 for Denmark;\n(e) EUR\u00a015\u00a0700\u00a0000 for Germany;\n(f) EUR\u00a0180\u00a0000 for Estonia;\n(g) EUR\u00a0800\u00a0000 for Ireland;\n(h) EUR\u00a050\u00a0000 for Greece;\n(i) EUR\u00a021\u00a0000\u00a0000 for Spain;\n(j) EUR\u00a057\u00a0000\u00a0000 for France;\n(k) EUR\u00a03\u00a0000\u00a0000 for Italy;\n(l) EUR\u00a0460\u00a0000 for Latvia;\n(m) EUR\u00a00 for Lithuania;\n(n) EUR\u00a0510\u00a0000 for Luxembourg;\n(o) EUR\u00a01\u00a0400\u00a0000 for Hungary;\n(p) EUR\u00a05\u00a0000 for Malta;\n(q) EUR\u00a050\u00a0000 for the Netherlands;\n(r) EUR\u00a03\u00a0350\u00a0000 for Austria;\n(s) EUR\u00a0500\u00a0000 for Poland;\n(t) EUR\u00a05\u00a0300\u00a0000 for Portugal;\n(u) EUR\u00a0250\u00a0000 for Romania;\n(v) EUR\u00a0910\u00a0000 for Slovenia;\n(w) EUR\u00a0820\u00a0000 for Finland;\n(x) EUR\u00a01\u00a0550\u00a0000 for Sweden.\n(a) for an ELISA test EUR\u00a02,5 per test;\n(b) for a PCR test EUR\u00a010 per test;\n(c) for the purchase of monovalent vaccines EUR\u00a00,3 per dose;\n(d) for the purchase of bivalent vaccines EUR\u00a00,45 per dose;\n(e) for the administration of vaccines to bovine animals EUR\u00a01,50 per bovine animal vaccinated, regardless of the number and types of doses used;\n(f) for the administration of vaccines to ovine or caprine animals EUR\u00a00,75 per ovine or caprine animal vaccinated, regardless of the number and types of doses used.\u2019;\n2. in Article 9(2)(l), the amount \u2018EUR\u00a01\u00a0800\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a050\u00a0000\u2019;\n3. in Article 13(2)(e), the amount \u2018EUR\u00a0370\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0530\u00a0000\u2019;\n4. the following Article 15a is inserted:\n(a) 100\u00a0% of the costs to be incurred by Cyprus for carrying out rapid tests and primary molecular tests;\n(b) 75\u00a0% of the cost incurred by Cyprus for the compensation to owners for the value of their animals culled and destroyed in accordance with its programme for monitoring and eradication of scrapie;\n(c) 50\u00a0% of the costs of:\n(i) the analysis of samples for genotyping;\n(ii) the purchase of preparations used for euthanasing the animals;\n(iii) personnel specifically hired for carrying out tasks within the programme;\n(iv) destruction of the carcasses.\n(a) for tests carried out in ovine and caprine animals referred to in Part II of Chapter A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 EUR\u00a030 per test;\n(b) for primary molecular discriminatory tests carried out as referred to in point 3.2(c)(i) of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 EUR\u00a0175 per test;\n(c) for genotyping tests EUR\u00a010 per test;\n(d) for culled sheep or goats 100\u00a0EUR per animal.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a019.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0322, 2.12.2008, p.\u00a039.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0115, 29.4.2008, p.\u00a044.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0314, 1.12.2007, p.\u00a029.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0147, 31.5.2001, p.\u00a01.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a034, 4.2.2009, p.\u00a011."}
