In view of the current level of coverage and representativeness for the operational data base for bovine animals (DBB) in Austria, it may be used to obtain statistical data on the following characteristics:\n- total bovine livestock\n- bovine animals less than one year old\n- bovine animals aged between one and two years\n- male\n- female\n- bovine animals of two years and over\n- male\n- female\n- heifers\n- cows.\n2. Since the following characteristics cannot be obtained from the DBB, they shall be the subject of supplementary statistical surveys:\n- bovine animals less than one year old, calves for slaughter\n- bovine animals less than one year old, other\n- bovine animals less than one year old, other, male\n- bovine animals less than one year old, other, female\n- bovine animals aged between one and two years, female, animals for slaughter\n- bovine animals aged between one and two years, female, other\n- bovine animals of two years and over, heifers for slaughter\n- bovine animals of two years and over, heifers, other\n- bovine animals of two years and over, cows, dairy cows\n- bovine animals of two years and over, cows, other\nFor comparison reasons the following characteristics have also to be the subject of this supplementary statistical survey:\n- total bovine livestock\n- bovine animals less than one year old\n- bovine animals aged between one and two years\n- male\n- female\n- bovine animals of two years and over\n- male\n- female\n- heifers\n- cows.\n3.

This group shall always undertake a detailed examination each time there is a significant change in the DBB.\n4. An annual report shall be compiled by Austria on the use of the DBB for statistical purposes. After this authorisation has expired, Austria is required to forward a report to the European Commission, which makes possible a comparison of the DBB results with the results of the cattle surveys. For this purpose in 2003 - parallel to the structure survey of agricultural holdings - a cattle survey will be carried out which meets the requirements of Council Directive 93/23/EEC in accordance with Article 4. On the basis of this comparison and the annual reports, and following an opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, the Commission may take a decision on the statistical use of the DBB.\n5.
