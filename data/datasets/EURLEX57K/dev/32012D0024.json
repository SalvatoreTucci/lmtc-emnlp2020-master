Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(8) Following disclosure, one party argued that it should not have been excluded from the definition of the Union industry or that, alternatively, the provisional Regulation should be amended so as to include the party in that definition. In this respect, it should be pointed out that the findings of the provisional Regulation, on the basis of information obtained in the course of the investigation, were only provisional, as stated in recital 31 of the provisional Regulation itself. As the anti-dumping proceedings are terminated without the imposition of definitive measures, following the withdrawal of the complaint, it is not appropriate, in a terminating decision, neither to provide definitive determinations nor to amend a provisional Regulation.\n(9) It is recalled that the findings at hand were provisional in nature. It follows that any future case relating to the product or the parties concerned by this proceeding will be assessed on its own merits.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of the product concerned originating in the USA should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.\n(11) Any duties provisionally secured on the basis of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0821/2011 should be released,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of vinyl acetate, currently falling within CN code 2915\u00a032\u00a000 and originating in the United States of America, is hereby terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.", "Regulation (EU) No\u00a0821/2011 is hereby repealed.", "The amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duties pursuant to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0821/2011 on imports of vinyl acetate currently falling within CN code 2915\u00a032\u00a000 and originating in the United States of America shall be released.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 327, 4.12.2010, p. 23.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 17.8.2011, p. 24."}
