That list includes cis-Tricos-9-ene.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, cis-Tricos-9-ene has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 19, repellents and attractants, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.\n(3) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 11 November 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 25 May 2012, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as attractants and containing cis-Tricos-9-ene may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include cis-Tricos-9-ene in Annex I to that Directive.\n(6) Not all potential uses and exposure scenarios have been evaluated at Union level. For example, outdoor use and exposure of food or feeding stuff were not assessed. It is therefore appropriate to require that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(7) In the light of the possible indirect human exposure via consumption of food as a result of those uses represented in the assessment, it is appropriate to require, where relevant, verification of the need to set new or to amend existing maximum residue levels according to Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) or Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC\u00a0(4). Measures should be adopted ensuring that the applicable maximum residue levels are not exceeded.\n(8) The provisions of this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products of product-type 19 containing the active substance cis-Tricos-9-ene and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(10) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(11) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents of 28 September 2011\u00a0(5), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 September 2013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 October 2014.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
