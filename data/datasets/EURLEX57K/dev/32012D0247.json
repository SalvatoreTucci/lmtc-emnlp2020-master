Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(6) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(7) By letter of 26 January 2012 to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.\n(8) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or steel originating in Belarus should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes or iron or steel, excluding seamless pipes and steel of stainless steel, of circular cross-section, of an external diameter not exceeding 406,4\u00a0mm with a Carbon Equivalent Value (CEV) not exc\u0117eding 0,86 according to the International Institute of Welding (IIW) formula and chemical analysis\u00a0(3) originating in Belarus, currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a07304\u00a019\u00a010, ex\u00a07304\u00a019\u00a030, ex\u00a07304\u00a023\u00a000, ex\u00a07304\u00a029\u00a010, ex\u00a07304\u00a029\u00a030, ex\u00a07304\u00a031\u00a080, ex\u00a07304\u00a039\u00a058, ex\u00a07304\u00a039\u00a092, ex\u00a07304\u00a039\u00a093, ex\u00a07304\u00a051\u00a089, ex\u00a07304\u00a059\u00a092 and ex\u00a07304\u00a059\u00a093, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a051.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0187, 28.6.2011, p.\u00a022.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The CEV shall be determined in accordance with Technical Report, 1967, IIW doc.
