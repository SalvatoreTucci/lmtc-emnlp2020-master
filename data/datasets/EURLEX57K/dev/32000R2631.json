The finalisation and adoption of those implementing measures will not be completed by 30 November 2000. Certain Council provisions repealed by Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should accordingly be allowed to stand for a short additional period.\n(2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.\n(3) More progress has been made in adopting implementing measures in certain areas than in others. Provision should therefore be made for an extra transitional period that depends on the area concerned.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1608/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
