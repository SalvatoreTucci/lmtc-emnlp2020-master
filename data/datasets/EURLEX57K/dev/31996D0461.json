Save energy\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 0,23 kWh of electrical energy per kg of washload in an EN 60456 test, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Commission Directive 95/12/EC.\nThe machine will thus qualify for energy efficiency classes A and B as defined in Directive 95/12/EC, Annex IV.\n2. Save water\nThe machine must use less than or equal to 15 litres of water per kg of washload in an EN 60456 test, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.\n3. Prevent detergent loss\nThe machine must lose less than or equal to 5 % of detergent in an IEC 456:1994 test with the detergent added via the detergent drawer.\nBEST PRACTICE CRITERIA\n4. Instruct the user\n1. The machine must have clear markings on it identifying the appropriate settings according to fabric type and laundry code.\n2. The machine must have clear markings on it identifying energy and water saving programmes and options.\n3. The instruction manual of the machine must provide advice on the correct environmental use, and in particular:\n- advice on proper installation and, if hot-fill is available on the machine, advice on the fuel used for home water heating,\n- advice to use a full load rather than part loads wherever possible. Clear examples of (a) typical maximum load(s) must be included,\n- advice on varying the detergent dose according to water hardness, load size and the degree of soiling,\n- information about the energy consumption and the water consumption of the machine for different temperature settings and for different load settings and according to whether hot- or cold-fill is an option,\n- advice on sorting fabrics appropriately, the corresponding wash temperature according to the fabric type, also stating that in most cases washing at higher temperatures is no longer necessary when using modern detergents and modern machines,\n- advice on situations where a prewash, if available, is likely to be required,\n- information about the washing machine being made of parts and materials which are reusable and/or recyclable,\n- advice that when disposing of the washing machine the consumer should enquire about, and follow the applicable water-management routes.\n5. Encourage recycling\nWhere they occur in components greater than 50 g, plastic parts of the machine must have a permanent marking identifying the material. The correct material abbreviations to be used, are: 1. PET, 2. HIDPE, 3. PVC, 4. LDPE, 5. PP, 6. PS, 7. all other plastics to conform to ISO1043.\nPERFORMANCE CRITERIA\n6. Wash adequately\nThe machine must achieve a washing performance index of more than 0,94 in an EN 60456 test, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.\nThe machine will thus qualify for washing performance class A, B, C or D as defined in Directive 95/12/EC, Annex IV.\n7. Rinse adequately\nThe machine must achieve at least a minimum rinsing efficiency of 30 dilutions as defined in IEC 456:1994.\n8. Provide information on noise\nInformation about the noise of the washing machine during washing and spinning shall be provided in a way clearly visible to the consumer. This shall be done by the incorporation of this information in the energy label.\nTest methods used for measuring the noise shall be EN 60704-2-4 and EN 60704-3.\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nThe following text shall be provided in such a way as to be clearly visible for consumers (beside the label, whenever possible):\n- 'Product in compliance with the ecological criteria of the European eco-label awards scheme relating to reduced:\n- energy consumption,\n- water consumption,\n- water pollution.`\n- 'Additional environmental information is given in the instruction manual on how to minimize environmental impacts.`"}
