The safe operation of the HFR (high flux reactor) in Petten. This comprises routine operation of the facility for more than 250 days/year, fuel cycle management and safety and quality management.\n2. Efficient utilization of the reactor in a wide scope of topical sectors: irradiation testing of materials for fission reactors, as well as for future thermonuclear fusion reactors, neutron applications to solid state physics and materials sciences  investigations, radioisotope production and related activities, neutron radiography as a non-destructive testing method, and treatment of certain types of cancer with neutrons (Boron neutron capture therapy) and related research.\nANNEX II\nINDICATIVE BREAKDOWN OF FUNDS  The funds to be contributed to the supplementary programme are broken down as follows:\n- Germany 50 %\n- Netherlands 50 %\nOther funds are provided for, in addition to the supplementary programme, either under the heading of work carried out as part of the JRC specific programmes or under the heading of contractual work.\nThe indicative breakdown is as follows:\n- Supplementary programme:\n(a) Exploitation of reactor\n- GermanyECU 32,5 million (1)\n- NetherlandsECU 32,5 million (1)\n(b) Preparation of experiments (studies, rigs, etc.)\n- GermanyECU 10,0 million\n- Netherlandsp.m. (2)\nTotal appropriationsECU 75,0 million\n- JRC specific programmes and contractual work\nfor external third partiesECU 15,0 million + p.m. (1)\n(1) These figures should be the subject of a review and a possible revision at mid-term (mid-1993).\n(2) Work to be carried out directly by the Netherlands, the equivalent of such work valued by the Commission at ECU 10 million."}
