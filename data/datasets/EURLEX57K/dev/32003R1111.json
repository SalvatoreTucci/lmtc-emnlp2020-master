This tariff quota includes 572000 tonnes for imports originating in the United States of America and 38000 tonnes for imports originating in Canada.\n(2) In the first and second quarter of 2003 for imports under subquota III, that covers all third countries except the United States of America and Canada, there has been substantial interest from operators, leading to oversubscription. There have also been communication problems between the Commission and authorities in some Member States, leading to uncertainties about the actual quantities requested in the whole of the Community and to difficulties in checking availability within the quota. It is appropriate to clarify the obligations of Member States in this context.\n(3) The validity of import licences is currently regulated by Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 498/2003(8). In view of the uncertainty as to the validity of import licences, it is appropriate to insert an express provision in Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 in order to ensure that the validity of import licences under the tariff-rate quota is not shorter than 45 days.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 was initially adopted for a transitional period, from 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2003, pending the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1766/92. Since the provisions of that Regulation have operated satisfactorily during the period concerned, it is appropriate to apply them on a permanent basis.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) In paragraph 1, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\"Each licence application must be for a quantity that may not exceed the quantity available under the subquota for the import of the product concerned in the period concerned.
