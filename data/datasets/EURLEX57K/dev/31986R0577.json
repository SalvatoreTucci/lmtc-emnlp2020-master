The accession compensatory amounts referred to in Article 1, applicable until the end of the 1985/86 marketing year, shall be as shown in Annex I, being derived from the accession compensatory amounts applicable to the cereals to which they are related on the basis of the coefficients listed in the same Annex.\n2. The accession compensatory amounts applicable to products, for which the incidence of the production refunds provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 must be taken into account, shall

pursuant to Article 5 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 467/86, the accession compensatory amount for one of the cereals referred to in Article 1 (a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 is determined on the basis of the table in the Annex to the first Regulation referred to, the amount applicable to the processed product as an accession compensatory amount shall be determined on the basis of the changes in the amount fixed for the basic cereal pursuant to Article 5 (1) referred to above.", "Where, for a given product, an accession compensatory amount is fixed which must be deducted from the refund on exports to third countries and where the refund is less than this accession compensatory amount or has not been fixed, it may be, provided that an amount not exceeding the difference between the accession compensatory amount and the refund and, or, according to case, the accession compensatory amount may be charged on exports from Spain to a third country of the relevant product.\nWhere refunds are differentiated according to destination, if the refund applicable to exports to one or more third countries is less than the accession compensatory amount or has not been fixed, measures to ensure the charging, where appropriate, of the amount referred to in the previous subparagraph may be provided for.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 March
