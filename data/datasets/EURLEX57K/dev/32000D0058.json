Complementary reports supplied by Portugal indicated that more samples of pine trees showed infestation by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et B\u00fchrer) Nickle et al.\n(3) Sweden, on the basis of the abovementioned information from Portugal, adopted on 29 September 1999, certain additional measures including a special heat treatment and the use of a plant passport, for all wood leaving Portugal, with a view to strengthening protection against the introduction of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et B\u00fchrer) Nickle et al. from Portugal.\n(4) It has not yet been possible either to identify the source of contamination although elements indicate that packaging material is the most likely pathway, or to determine the full extent thereof in Portugal.\n(5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to take specific measures. It may also be necessary for the other Member States to adopt additional measures to protect themselves against that danger.\n(6) The above measures should refer to movements of wood, isolated bark and host plants from Portugal to the other Member States. However it is necessary not to apply such measures to movements from area(s) in Portugal in which Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et B\u00fchrer) Nickle et al. is known not to occur, into the other Member States, and to Thuja L.\n(7) It is also necessary that Portugal take measures to control the spread of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et B\u00fchrer) Nickle et al. with the aim of eradication.\n(8) If it becomes apparent that the emergency measures referred to in the present Decision are not sufficient to prevent the entry of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et B\u00fchrer) Nickle et al., or have not been complied with, more stringent or alternative measures should be envisaged.\n(9) The effect of the emergency measures will be assessed continually during 1999/2000, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States. Possible subsequent measures applicable to the introduction of wood, and isolated bark of Conifers (Coniferales), except that of Thuja L., and plants of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Lariz Mill, Picea A. Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr., other than fruit and seeds, caning from Portugal will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Portugal shall ensure for wood and isolated bark as specified in the Annex to this Decision and plants of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Larix Mill., Picea A.
