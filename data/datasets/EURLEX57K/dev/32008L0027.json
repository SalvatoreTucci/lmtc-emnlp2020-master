Those measures are designed to adapt certain annexes, establish criteria for the notification and fix minimum thresholds. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2001/18/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 2001/18/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive 2001/18/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States. It is therefore not necessary to lay down provisions to that effect,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 2001/18/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
