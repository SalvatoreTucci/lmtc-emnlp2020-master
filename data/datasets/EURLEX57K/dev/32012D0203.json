In particular, Annex I to that Decision sets out a list of third countries from which imports of live, chilled, frozen or processed bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods for human consumption are permitted. That list also indicates restrictions concerning such imports from certain third countries.\n(4) Chile is currently included in the list in Annex I to Decision 2006/766/EC as a third country from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods intended for human consumption are permitted, but such imports are restricted to frozen or processed bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and to certain chilled and eviscerated Pectinidae.\n(5) A Commission inspection was carried out in Chile from 26 April to 6 May 2010, to evaluate the control system in place governing the production of bivalve molluscs intended for export to the Union. The outcome of that inspection, together with the guarantees provided by the competent authority of Chile, indicate that the conditions applicable in that third country to live bivalve molluscs echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods intended for export to the Union are equivalent to those laid down in the relevant Union legislation. The restrictions to imports into the Union of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods from Chile should therefore no longer apply.\n(6) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Decision 2006/766/EC, the entry for Chile is replaced by the following:\n\u2018CL CHILE\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 320, 18.11.2006, p. 53."}
