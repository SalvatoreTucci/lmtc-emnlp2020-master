These events have a special general resonance in Italy, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events. Moreover, they have a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the Italian population, given their important contribution to understanding between peoples and the importance of sport for the Italian society as a whole and for the national pride, as they provide the occasion for top Italian sportsmen to succeed in these most important international competitions.\n(7) The other listed football events have a special general resonance in Italy and have a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the Italian population, given the importance of football for the Italian society as a whole and for the national pride, as they provide the occasion for Italian teams to succeed in top-level football matches attracting international attention.\n(8) The Giro d\u2019Italia has a special general resonance in Italy and a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance as a catalyst of national cultural identity, not only because of its importance as a highlevel sports event but also as an occasion to promote the country of Italy.\n(9) The special general resonance in Italy and the generally recognised, distinct cultural importance of the Formula One Italian Grand Prix for the Italian population results from the great success of Italian cars in Formula One races.\n(10) The San Remo Italian music festival has a special general resonance in Italy and has a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for Italian cultural identity as a \u2018popular culture\u2019 event forming part of the Italian cultural tradition.\n(11) The Italian measures appear proportionate so as to justify a the derogation from the fundamental EC Treaty freedom to provide services on the basis of an overriding reason of public interest, which is to ensure wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society.\n(12) The Italian measures are compatible with EC competition rules in that the definition of qualified broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria which allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of listed events is not disproportionate so as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay-television markets.\n(13) After communication by the Commission to the other Member States of the Italian measures and consultation of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC, the Director-General for Education and Culture informed Italy, by letter of 5 July 1999, that the European Commission did not intend to object to the measures notified.\n(14) On 7 September 1999, an amendment to the Italian measures was notified to the Commission. This amendment did not introduce any changes to the events listed.\n(15) The Italian measures were published in the C Series of the Official Journal of the European Communities\n\u00a0(2) in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC. The corrigendum to that publication was subsequently published in the C Series of the Official Journal of the European Communities\n\u00a0(3).\n(16) It follows from the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Case T-33/01, Infront WM v Commission, that the declaration that measures taken pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC are compatible with Community law constitutes a decision within the meaning of Article 249 of the EC Treaty, which must therefore be adopted by the Commission. Accordingly, it is necessary to declare by this Decision that the measures notified by Italy are compatible with Community law. The measures, as set out in the Annex to this Decision, should be published in the Official Journal in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC,", "main_body": ["The measures pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC notified by Italy to the Commission on 10 May 1999, as published in the \nOfficial Journal of the European Communities C 277 of 30 September 1999 (corrigendum in the \nOfficial Journal of the European Communities C 208 of 26 July 2001), are compatible with Community law.", "The measures, as set out in the Annex to this Decision, shall be published in the Official Journal in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, p. 23.
