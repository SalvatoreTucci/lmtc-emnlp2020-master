Portugal decided therefore to introduce emergency vaccination in order to contain the outbreak.\n(5) Commission Decision 2008/285/EC\u00a0(2) approved the emergency vaccination plan submitted by Portugal. That Decision also provided for certain measures to be applied in a holding where vaccinated mallard ducks are kept and in unvaccinated poultry holdings, including movement restrictions on vaccinated mallard ducks, their hatching eggs and mallard ducks hatched from such eggs in accordance with the approved vaccination plan.\n(6) The implementation of the emergency vaccination plan applied by Portugal has been completed by 31 July 2008.\n(7) In accordance with Article 8 of Decision 2008/285/EC, Portugal has submitted a report on the implementation of the emergency vaccination plan and has reported to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(8) On the basis of the information provided by Portugal, it appears that the outbreak has been successfully contained.\n(9) Based on a further risk assessment, Portugal deems that on the holding the high value mallard breeding ducks are still exposed to the potential risk of avian influenza infection, in particular by possible indirect contact with wild birds. Portugal has therefore decided to continue vaccination against avian influenza as a long-term measure by implementing a preventive vaccination plan on the holding at risk in the region of Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Ribatejo Norte, Vila Nova da Barquinha that keeps such mallard ducks.\n(10) Portugal has by letter dated 10 September 2008 submitted a preventive vaccination plan to the Commission for approval.\n(11) According to that preventive vaccination plan, Portugal intends to introduce preventive vaccination which is to be applied until 31 July 2009.\n(12) In its scientific opinions on the use of vaccination to control avian influenza issued by the European Food Safety Authority in 2005\u00a0(3), 2007\u00a0(4) and 2008\u00a0(5), the Animal Health and Welfare Panel stated that emergency and preventive vaccination against avian influenza is a valuable tool to complement the control measures for that disease.\n(13) In addition, the Commission has examined the preventive vaccination plan submitted by Portugal, and is satisfied that it conforms with relevant Community legislation. In view of the epidemiological situation as regards low pathogenic avian influenza in Portugal, the type of holding to be vaccinated and the limited scope of the vaccination plan, it is appropriate to approve that preventive vaccination plan. The implementation of that preventive vaccination plan will also provide with further practical experience and knowledge on the efficacy of vaccine in mallard ducks.\n(14) For the purposes of the preventive vaccination plan to be carried out by Portugal, only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(6) or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency\u00a0(7) should be used.\n(15) In addition, surveillance and laboratory testing in the holding keeping the vaccinated mallard ducks and in unvaccinated poultry holdings should be carried out as set out in the preventive vaccination plan.\n(16) It is also appropriate to introduce certain restrictions on the movement of vaccinated mallard ducks, their hatching eggs and mallard ducks derived from vaccinated poultry in accordance with the preventive vaccination plan. Due to the small number of mallard ducks present on the holding where preventive vaccination is to be carried out, as well as for reasons of traceability and logistics, vaccinated birds should not be moved from that holding.\n(17) In relation to trade in poultry intended for restocking supplies of game, additional measures have been taken by Portugal pursuant to Commission Decision 2006/605/EC of 6 September 2006 on certain protection measures in relation to intra-Community trade in poultry intended for restocking of wild game supplies\u00a0(8).\n(18) In order to reduce the economic impact on the holding concerned, certain derogations from movement restrictions for mallard ducks derived from vaccinated mallard ducks should be provided for, since such movements do not pose a specific risk for spread of disease and provided that official surveillance is carried out and that the specific animal health requirements for intra-Community trade are complied with.\n(19) The preventive vaccination plan should be approved so that it can be implemented until 31 July 2009.\n(20) Decision 2008/285/EC should be repealed as it has become obsolete after 31 July 2008.\n(21) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision lays down certain measures to be applied in Portugal where preventive vaccination of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) intended for re-stocking supplies of game (mallard ducks) is carried out in a holding, which is exposed to the risk of avian influenza.
