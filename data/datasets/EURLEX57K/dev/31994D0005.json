Strengthening the European infrastructure for innovation services by the establishment of intra-Community networks while requiring their long-term self-sufficiency\nIn particular, this involves:\n1. The strengthening of intra-Community networks for innovation:\n(a) consolidation and development of existing networks, particularly involving:\n- technology and innovation management consultants,\n- sectoral collective research centres,\n- innovation financing institutions;\n(b) formation of new networks, particularly between:\n- contract-research organizations,\n- engineering consultants,\n- quality and value-analysis specialists, etc.;\n(c) strengthening intra-Community cooperation between:\n- research/industry and university/industry interfaces,\n- technopoles and science parks;\n(d) introduction of linkage mechanisms between the various networks such as to promote innovation and technology transfer.\n2. Network support measures:\n(a) actions of information, awareness, promotion and the transfer of know-how in innovation management and related measures:\n- exchanges of experience between Member States and across national frontiers, between regions of the various Member States, in particular through support for studies, specialist seminars and the formation of networks of experts in relevant management  disciplines (quality, value analysis, marketing, etc.),\n- dissemination of these management techniques by appropriate promotional activities (conferences, exhibitions, European prizes, \"success stories\", etc.),\n- actions of information, awareness and the transfer of know-how, of a transnational character or purpose, for the publics involved in the dissemination and transfer of technology and innovation management - these actions to be developed in close  liaison with the Comett programme;\n(b) specific instruments to enhance the effectiveness of networks, involving particularly:\n- bringing together future network participants (for example by means of visits and professional exchanges, introductory seminars, etc.),\n- exchanges of technology opportunities, especially through measures aimed at:\n- enhancing the transnational impact of technology exhibitions and fairs (cooperation between organizers in different regions, visits by manufacturers from other regions, etc.),\n- developing means of communicating these technology opportunities and appropriate use thereof (catalogues, exhibitions, study grants, data banks, conferences and seminars, video conferences, etc.),\n- identifying \"best practice\" with respect to technology transfer,\n- specific measures to ensure that those regions of the Community with a less well-developed service infrastructure for innovation can participate more fully in the various intra-Community networks;\n(c) the launching of innovations emerging from networks by improving the dialogue between sources of funding, technical experts and innovators identified by the networks (for example, through a data bank of projects, intra-Community investment forums  and brokerage meetings).\nB. Supporting specific projects for intra-Community innovation transfer, particularly by means of:\n- support for specific projects of transnational character, emphasizing industrial cooperation and, in particular, involving the application of generic technologies to target industrial sectors in regions of lagging development or in industrial decline  in the Community,\n- accompanying measures to heighten awareness of these technologies and to train companies adopting them, emphasizing the transnational dimension (e.g. visits to companies, exhibitions, information seminars, production of brochures or audio-visual  material, etc.),\n- the provision of technical support for companies and especially to small and medium sized undertakings potentially able to use these technologies, in particular by employing specialized technology transfer networks and advanced-technology centres,\n- support for the effective execution of projects, particularly by mobilizing available funding from the public and private sectors.\nTwin approaches can be followed:\n- one of these identifies available technologies with a cost-benefit ratio suiting them for widespread adoption by companies in regions of lagging development or in industrial decline, and is therefore designed to promote the use of these technologies  in the sectors concerned,\n- the other is based on identifying a need, common to a group of companies in a given sector or region where the companies are prepared to finance the solution. It encourages the identification and possible adaptation of available technologies to deal  with the problem detected.\nThe planned projects shall act as a catalyst in the development of the sectors and the use of the technologies concerned. They must also meet, wholly or in part, the following criteria:\n- be model projects in that they employ a \"systemic\" overall approach to the introduction of technological change, not only in purely technical terms but also with regard to such aspects as company organization, the training and motivation of personnel  and the use of such management methods as value analysis or industrial design and also the assessment of market potential,\n- provide an optimum combination of skills through forms of cooperation between several Member States or between regions of different Member States of the Community and, wherever possible, between partners of differing specialist skills,\n- involve industrial sectors or technologies chosen to guarantee a significant economic impact,\n- make an active contribution to reducing regional disparities in the availability of - and access to - technologies,\n- be based as far as possible on existing infrastructures and enhance the use made of these,\n- include follow-up and evaluation provisions, based in particular on stated and readily verifiable quantitative aims,\n- ensure feedback of the experience gained, preferably directly by the companies benefiting from the scheme, in order to maximize the multiplier effect.\nC. Improving the innovation environment through a better understanding of the processes involved and increased concertation between the Member States and the Commission\n1. monitoring of innovation in Europe (European Innovation Monitoring System) and evaluation of support measures;\n2. strengthening concertation and the exchange of experience between the Member States and the Commission in the field of innovation policy and technology transfer, in particular with the aim of establishing a regulatory, legal, economic and fiscal  environment favourable to innovation and technology transfer.\nANNEX II\nINDICATIVE INTERNAL BREAKDOWN OF APPROPRIATIONS\n(Sprint programme 1989 to 1994)\n\"ECU million\"\" ID=\"1\">A.
