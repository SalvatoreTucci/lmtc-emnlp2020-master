That Directive does not apply to extraction solvents used in the production of food additives, vitamins and other nutritional additives, unless such food additives, vitamins or nutritional additives are listed in its Annex I. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) evaluated the safety of dimethyl ether as an extraction solvent to remove fat from animal protein raw materials and expressed its opinion of 29 January 2009\u00a0(2). The Authority concluded that there is no safety concern provided that the maximum residual limit of dimethyl ether is 9\u00a0\u03bcg/kg of extracted animal proteins. Therefore the use of dimethyl ether as an extraction solvent to remove fat from animal protein raw materials should be authorised under the condition of a maximum residual limit of dimethyl ether of 9\u00a0\u03bcg/kg in the defatted protein product.\n(2) Part III of Annex I to Directive 2009/32/EC does not establish specific residue limits in foodstuffs for methanol and propan-2-ol resulting from the preparation of flavourings. Member States and the Commission pointed out that the general residue limit of 10\u00a0mg/kg for methanol and propane-2-ol, as set out in Part II of Annex I to Directive 2009/32/EC, is too strict if applied directly to flavourings.\n(3) Therefore specific limits should be set in foodstuffs for methanol and propan-2-ol resulting from their use for the preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials. Those limits should be lower than the limit of 10\u00a0mg/kg assessed as safe by the Scientific Committee for Food\u00a0(3), in order to be considered as safe.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2009/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 September 2011 at the latest.
