It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC\u00a0(4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902\u00a011\u00a000 and 1902\u00a019 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93\u00a0(5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed either in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 respectively, are fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 18 June 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 June 2004.\nFor the Commission\nErkki LIIKANEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.
