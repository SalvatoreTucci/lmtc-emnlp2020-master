In particular, it is laid down that the release for a specific use in the Community shall be made in a way which avoids both disturbance of the market and direct competition with disposal of intervention products.\n(2) In application of Article 2 and the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 France has bought a certain quantity of beef. It is likely that France will continue to buy meat under partial tenders until the end of the year.\n(3) France has submitted a request to the Commission to release up to 5000 tonnes of beef bought in under the scheme and intended to be distributed to the most deprived persons in France meeting the eligibility criteria applied under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 of 29 October 1992 laying down detailed rules of the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1098/2001(4). According to the request for approval the release should follow the same procedure as the one laid down in the first and second indent of Article 4(2)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92.\n(4) As release for direct consumption by the most deprived persons does not disturb the market and currently does not compete with disposal of intervention products, the French request should be met. However, in order not to disturb the market where released products are intended as payment in kind such products may not comprise meat from hindquarters corresponding to pistola hindquarters with a maximum of eight ribs.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
