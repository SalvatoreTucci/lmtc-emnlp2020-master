As of 26 May 2003, provided that no new outbreaks have been reported, it seemed appropriate to limit the trade restrictions in force to the previously disease affected areas and an appropriate buffer zone around these areas and to allow trade in live poultry and poultry products from the rest of the Belgian territory, which could then be considered as free of avian influenza.\n(5) Furthermore certain movements of day-old chicks and slaughter poultry should be authorised to other parts of Belgium.\n(6) In the light of the positive disease evolution the measures laid down in Decision 2003/289/EC should be further prolonged until 11 June 2003.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/289/EC shall be amended as follows:\n1.
