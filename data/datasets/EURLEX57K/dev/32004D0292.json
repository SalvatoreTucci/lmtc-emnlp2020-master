That date should therefore serve as the starting point for Traces to avoid the need for contracts to be renewed.\n(4) Some Member States are not able to use Traces from the date set by the Commission, i.e. 1 April 2004, as they are not yet ready to make the switch from Animo to Traces. Provision should therefore be made for a transition period to allow those Member States to complete their migration to Traces.\n(5) Decision 92/486/EEC should be amended to enable contracts between those Member States availing themselves of a transition period and the Animo host centre to be renewed.\n(6) The contracts between the Animo host centre and the border inspection posts located in Germany, Austria and Italy listed in Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 of 18 February 2004 introducing a document for the declaration of, and veterinary checks on, animals from third countries entering the Community(8) will have to be adapted to take account of the scheduled disappearance of those border inspection posts in connection with the accession of new Member States.\n(7) To enable the first group of Member States migrating to Traces to adjust to it, the functions of the new system should be introduced in stages, while ensuring that as soon as it is introduced the level of information is the same as that achieved by the Animo system.\n(8) All the information contained in the common veterinary entry documents provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004(9) for products, in the common veterinary entry documents provided for in Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 for animals and in the certificates for intra-Community trade as harmonised by Commission Regulation (EC) No 599/2004(10) must be transmitted via the Traces system.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \"Animo\": the computerised network linking veterinary authorities, provided for in Decision 91/398/EEC;\n(b) \"Traces\": the integrated computerised veterinary system provided for in Decision 2003/24/EC.", "Member States shall use the Traces system from 1 April 2004 and shall cease entering messages in the Animo system from that date.", "1.
