whereas, within the limits of these tariff quotas, the customs duties applicable are to be abolished progressively according to the same timetables and under the same conditions as laid down in Articles 5 and 16 of the said Protocol;\nWhereas, however, the Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the Community (2) lays down that those two Member States will postpone, until 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990 respectively, implementation of the preferential arrangements for the products covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2238/88 (4); whereas, consequently, the tariff quotas mentioned above apply only to the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas the Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened for the periods as shown in Article 1;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure that all Community importers enjoy equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for those quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas, in the present case, it would appear advisable not to allocate the quotas among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they need, under the conditions and according to the procedures specified in Article 3; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of quota shares levied by that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["The customs duties applicable to imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 of the following products originating in Cyprus shall be suspended during the periods, at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas as shown below for each one:\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CN code  // Description  // Amount of quota (in tonnes)   // Quota duty (%)   //    //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //  // 09.1403   // ex 0706 10 00   // Carrots from 1 April to 15 May 1989   // 2 750   // 5,5   // 09.1405   // ex 0709 30 00  // Aubergines (egg-plants) from 1 October to 30 November 1989 198, 26. 7. 1988, p. 1.", "The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be managed by the Commission, which may take all appropriate administrative measures in order to ensure effective administration thereof.", "If an importer presents in a Member State a declaration of entry into free circulation, including a request for preferential benefit for a product covered by this Regulation and if that declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member States concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to its requirements from the corresponding quota amount.\nThe drawing requests, with indication of the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be transmitted to the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings are granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the declarations of entry into free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member States concerned to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the corresponding quota amount.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota amount, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests. Member States shall be informed by the Commission in accordance with the same procedures.", "1. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that their drawings pursuant to Article 3 enable imports to be charged without interruption against their accumulated shares of the Community quota.\n2.

Member States shall charge imports of the said goods against their drawings as and when the goods are entered with the customs authorities for free circulation.\n4.
