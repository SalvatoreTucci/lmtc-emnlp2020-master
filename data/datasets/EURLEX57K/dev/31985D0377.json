DEFINITION   OF   THE   EUROPEAN   SIZE   UNIT   (ESU)\n1. The European size unit is  based on the value of 1  000 ESU of total standard gross margin of the holding for the '1980`  reference period, as laid down in paragraph  1 of Annex  III to Commission Decision No  78/463/EEC,  as last amended by Decision 84/542/EEC.2. For subsequent reference periods for renewing and  updating SGMs, the value of 1  000 ECU defined above shall be multiplied by a coefficient to take  account, in monetary terms, of global agro-economic trends in the Community as a whole.This  coefficient shall be calculated by the Commission and fixed after consultation with the Member  States.</(BLK0)BLK2>\n<(BLK0)BLK2 ID=\"B\">\nB. ECONOMIC   SIZE   OF   THE   HOLDING\nThe economic size  of a holding is obtained by dividing the total standard gross margin of the holding by the number  of ECU on the basis of which the ESU has been determined for the corresponding reference period in  accordance with point  A of this Annex.</(BLK0)BLK2>\n<(BLK0)BLK2 ID=\"C\">\nC.
