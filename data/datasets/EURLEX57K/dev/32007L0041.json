It also provides for the recognition of protected zones within the Community.\n(2) Denmark was recognised as a protected zone with respect to Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr. Following the results of the relevant surveys carried out in Denmark, Denmark has submitted information showing that an adequate phytosanitary protection of Denmark against Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr does not require maintaining the status of Denmark as a protected zone against that organism and requested its protected zone status against Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr be withdrawn. Denmark should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(3) From information supplied by the Czech Republic, France and Italy respectively the Czech Republic, the regions of Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine and Alsace in France and the region of Basilicata in Italy should be recognised as protected zones in respect of Grapevine flavescence dor\u00e9e MLO, because this pathogen is not present there. Special requirements should therefore be laid down as regards the introduction into and the movement within the relevant protected zones of vine propagating material.\n(4) Annexes II, IV and V to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, IV and V to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 October 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
