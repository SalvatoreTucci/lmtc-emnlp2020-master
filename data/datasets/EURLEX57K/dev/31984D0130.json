Advanced microelectronics capability\nThe main objective is to provide the technological capability to design, manufacture and test very high-speed and very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSICs), that will be needed in the next two decades.\nA concurrent objective is to stimulate research and development on novel materials and devices for special applications. The activities to be pursued include:\n- computer-aided design, manufacture and test for very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSICs),\n- process steps for submicron feature sizes in silicon and other semiconductor materials, and their integration into complete technologies,\n- computer controlled VLSIC fabrication and equipment for design, manufacture and test of VLSICs,\n- techniques for interfacing ICs to their environment, including high-speed, high-density interconnect between chips,\n- research into optical information processing and transmission, notably integrated opto-electronics, optical switching and storage,\n- novel information and image display technologies,\n- novel organic and inorganic materials for electronics and optical technologies,\n- allowance for educational activities related to industrial research.\n2. Software technologies\nSoftware technology aims at providing the basic engineering, the methods and tools that are needed in the software development process, the management principles for information technology as well as the scientific knowledge underlying them, and aims to integrate them into a consistent technology. It is founded on traditional mathematics, economics and engineering practices.\nThree complementary research approaches will have to be combined.\nA. The first approach stresses the scientific foundations and covers such areas as formal mathematical techniques, taxonomy and metrics, including empirical techniques and modelling. This would entail essentially theoretical research work aimed at a better scientific understanding of the field with a view to establishing effective theories and methods for software development.\nB. The second approach focuses on the software production process.\nWork in this area would have to relate to all parts of the software life cycle and may address activities such as requirements analysis, specification, design, implementation, verification and validation, maintenance and enhancement. The full integration of methods and tools and phase-to-phase continuity will be of particular importance. Research and development activity in this area would mainly concentrate on methods and tools in software engineering and on their integration into complete systems for software production. The aim is the mastery of the technical production process of software goods.\nC. The third approach is concerned with the software development process as an economic activity in its own right. It focuses on software as a product, investigating the mutual dependencies between commercial goals of an enterprise and the technical characteristics and performance requirements of the software product. It also addresses the problem of producing application-specific software, and the way in which the knowledge about the field of application may influence the tools and methods for software development. This would entail research and development in the economics of industrial software production.\nThe aim of this approach is to provide the techniques and criteria for organizing, managing and optimizing all elements of software application technology and the software industrial production process.\n3. Advanced information processing (AIP)\nThe objective is to create an industrial exploitation basis for the transition from data processing to knowledge processing systems that is the key to the next computer generation.\nObjectives include the provision of more user-friendly interfaces to non-expert users, intelligent sensors and utilization of VLSICS.\nThe main thrust of research and development will be in the following topics:\n- information and knowledge engineering involving considerable basic research or expert systems, knowledge representation, inference and learning techniques,\n- external interfaces, including signal analysis, signal synthesis, pattern recognition, signal understanding, human factors and human perception,\n- information and knowledge storage, novel hardware technologies, advanced software techniques,\n- computer architectures for AIP. Some of these will be radically different from the classic von-Neumann, and some will seek to exploit parallelism,\n- design and system aspects, covering conventions, standards, specification, verification, design methods and general system methodology.\n4. Office systems\nThe objective is to carry out research on the information systems that will support the wide range of non-routine tasks performed by humans in the office environment. The research and development activities to be pursued include:\n- office system science, as prerequisite and support to the structural and functional analysis and description of office procedures, definition of standards and the design of office products and systems adapted to a variety of needs,\n- office work-stations, document description languages, document creation and distribution, man/machine interfaces,\n- office communication systems, including local area networks and their interconnection, integrated text-voice-image communication and value-added functions,\n- office filing and retrieval systems that provide easy and reliable access to mixed-mode data files, supporting the high-level functions performed in the office, e.g. retrieval of 'knowledge', content- and structure-addressable data bases, office document languages,\n- human factors, encompassing all aspects of the interactions between man and information handling systems and aspects of information handling systems as media of communication between people.\n5. Computer integrated manufacture (CIM)\nThe objective is to establish the technology base for progressive introduction of IT (information technologies) to all phases of the manufacturing cycle leading ultimately to fully integrated production systems.\nThe main emphasis is placed on manufacturing elements as they are needed for discrete batch manufacturing, as this is technologically the most demanding problem.\nThe main thrust of the research and development will concentrate on:\n- system architectures for CIM systems and the infrastructure required to support them,\n- computer-aided design and engineering (CAD and CAE) systems,\n- computer-aided manufacture, test and repair systems, - real-time control of machines and systems, including automated assembly, robots, numerically-controlled machine tools, and entire FMS's (flexible manufacturing systems),\n- sub-systems and components, including real-time imaging and control systems, micro-electronic sub-systems, sensor systems,\n- demonstration models of CIM sub-systems leading to complete CIM demonstrators for experiments in real-live situations.\nIn all areas, AIP concepts and developments will be exploited where appropriate.\n6. Infrastructure actions\nThe infrastructure actions consist of a number of specific measures aimed at establishing the conditions required for successful execution of cooperative research and development on a Community level and for drawing the maximum benefit from ESPRIT as a whole.\nThese infrastructure activities include in particular:\n- coordination of Community and Member States' research and development programmes, acquisition of information, both within the ESPRIT programme and from the world at large, and its appropriate dissemination,\n- coordination and documentation of standards within the ESPRIT programme and their relationship with national and international standards,\n- an information exchange system (IES) to ensure ease of communication to serve the good technical execution of research and development projects as well as their management and the appropriate dissemination of their results. Progressive implementation and upgrading would have to enable direct computer communication and distributed software development."}
