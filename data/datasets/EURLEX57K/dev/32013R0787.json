That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a new use of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) as a feed additive for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EU) No 107/2010\u00a0(2), for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 885/2011\u00a0(3) and for weaned piglets and weaned Suidae other than Sus scrofa domesticus by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 306/2013\u00a0(4).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) in its opinion of 13 March 2013\u00a0(5) confirmed its previous conclusions that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) is presumed safe for animal and human health and the environment. The Authority also concluded that the additive has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance in turkeys for fattening and that this conclusion can be extended to turkeys reared for breeding. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 36, 9.2.2010, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 229, 6.9.2011, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 3.4.2013, p. 5.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(4):3176.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
