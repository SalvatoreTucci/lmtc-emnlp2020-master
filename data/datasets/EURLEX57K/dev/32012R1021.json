The Authority concluded in its opinion of 22 May 2012\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, since safety of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) has been established in the major poultry species with a wide margin of safety, this conclusion can be extended to all poultry species requested. They stated that a similar conclusion on efficacy can be extrapolated from major poultry species to all minor poultry species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The enzyme as specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 7.1.2010, p. 10.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 143, 31.5.2011, p. 10.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2739.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
