BARRY  (1) This Directive was notified to the Member States on 26 September 1984.\nANNEX I  METHOD OF MEASURING AIRBORNE NOISE EMITTED BY WELDING GENERATORS\nSCOPE\nThis measurement method shall be applicable to welding generators. It specifies the test procedures for use in determining the sound power level of such equipment for the purpose of EEC type-examination and checking as to conformity.\nThese technical procedures shall comply with the requirements of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC.\nAll the sections in Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC shall apply to welding generators, subject to the following amendments:\n4. CRITERIA TO BE USED FOR EXPRESSING RESULTS\n4.1. The acoustic criterion for the environment of welding generators shall be their sound power level.\n6. MEASURING CONDITIONS\n6.2. Operation of the sound source during measurement.\n6.2.1. Not applicable.\n6.2.2. Welding speed.\nThe welding generator unit shall be used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. It shall operate, as laid down in recommendation ISO/R700-1968, first edition, 1968, at its nominal speed producing the nominal welding current through a resistance.\n6.3. Measuring site.\nThe welding generator unit shall be installed on a reflecting plane of concrete or non-porous asphalt. Skid-mounted welding generators shall be placed on supports 0,40 m high, unless otherwise required by the manufacturer's conditions of installation.\n6.4.1. Measuring surface.\nThe measuring surface to be used for testing shall be a hemisphere. The centre of the hemisphere shall be the vertical projection on to the reflecting plane of the geometric centre of the welding generator. The radius shall be:    - 4 m, where the greatest dimension of the welding generator to be tested is not more than 1,5 m,\n- 10 m, where the greatest dimension of the welding generator to be tested is more than 1,5 m but not more than 4 m,\n- 16 m, where the greatest dimension of the welding generator to be tested is more than 4 m.\nTable I in Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC gives the coordinates of the measuring points.\n6.4.2.1. The x axis of the set of coordinates, in relation to which the positions of the measuring points are fixed, shall be parallel to the main axis of the welding generator unit.\n7. MEASUREMENTS\n7.1.1. Only the background noise shall be taken into account for the purpose of corrections.\n7.1.5. Presence of obstacles.\nA visual check in a circular zone with a radius of three times that of the measurement hemisphere and the centre of which coincides with the centre of that hemisphere is adequate to ensure that the provisions of the third subparagraph of section 6.3 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC are complied with.\n7.2. Measurement of the sound pressure level LpA.\nIf the sound pressure levels at the measuring points are determined from readings taken from a sonometer, there shall be at least five such readings, taken at regular intervals.\n8. USE OF RESULTS\n8.2. Not applicable.\n8.6.2. In view of 6.3, section 8.6.2 shall not be applicable and C = 0.\nANNEX II  MODEL INFORMATION DOCUMENT FOR A TYPE OF WELDING GENERATOR TO BE  SUPPLIED FOR EEC TYPE-EXAMINATION\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026419\">\nANNEX III  MODEL FOR MARK FOR SOUND POWER LEVEL\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026420\">\nANNEX IV  TECHNICAL PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING THE CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION MODELS  WITH THE TYPE EXAMINED\nThe conformity of production models with the type examined shall, if possible, be verified by spot checks."}
