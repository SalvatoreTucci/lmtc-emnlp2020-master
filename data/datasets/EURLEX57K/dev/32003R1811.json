The licences should be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines should be laid down for lodging licence applications and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.\n(4) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.\n(5) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(3), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.\n(6) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, as an exception to Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4).\n(7) Rapid two-way communication is needed between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(8) Since Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002 of 29 July 2002 establishing concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary(5), has been repealed by Decision 2003/285/EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1447/2002(6) laying down the detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002 should also be repealed.\n(9) Since the adjusting Protocol approved by Decision 2003/285/EC entered into force on 1 June 2003, the Regulation laying down the detailed rules for implementing that Decision must enter into force immediately.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
