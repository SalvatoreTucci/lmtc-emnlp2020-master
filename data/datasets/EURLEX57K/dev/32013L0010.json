Where an aerosol dispenser is classified as \u2018flammable\u2019 or \u2018extremely flammable\u2019, it must bear the flame symbol and the safety phrases S2 and S16 provided for in Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances\u00a0(2).\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures\u00a0(3) provides for the harmonisation of the classification and labelling of substances and mixtures within the Union. It incorporates at Union level the criteria for classification and labelling of substances and mixtures provided for by the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals which has been adopted at the international level, within the structure of the United Nations.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 will repeal and replace Directive 67/548/EEC and Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations\u00a0(4) as from 1 June 2015. It is therefore necessary to adapt the labelling provisions of Directive 75/324/EEC to that Regulation.\n(4) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, a distinction should be made between the date of applicability of national transposition provisions for aerosol dispensers containing a single substance and the date of applicability of national transposition provisions for aerosol dispensers containing mixtures. However, manufacturers of aerosol dispensers containing mixtures should be allowed to apply the labelling requirements of this Directive earlier, on a voluntary basis.\n(5) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, and in order to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on enterprises, a transitional period is provided for aerosol dispensers containing mixtures, labelled in accordance with the applicable provisions before 1 June 2015 and placed on the market until that date, allowing them their further marketing without relabelling.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directive on aerosol dispensers,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 75/324/EEC\nDirective 75/324/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 8, paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) the introductory sentence is replaced by the following:\n(b) point (d) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(d) the details referred to in point 2.2 of the Annex,\u2019;\n(2) the Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) in point 1, the following points 1.7a and 1.7b are inserted:\n(b) in point 2, points 2.2 to 2.4 are replaced by the following:\n(a) whatever its contents:\n(i) the hazard statement H229: \u201cPressurised container: May burst if heated\u201d;\n(ii) the precautionary statements P210 and P251 provided for in Part 1, Table 6.2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008;\n(iii) the precautionary statement P410 + P412 provided for in Part 1, Table 6.4 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008;\n(iv) the precautionary statement P102 provided for in Part 1, Table 6.1 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, where the aerosol dispenser is a consumer product;\n(v) any additional operating precautions which alert consumers to the specific dangers of the product; if the aerosol dispenser is accompanied by separate instructions for use, the latter must also reflect such operating precautions;\n(b) where the aerosol is classified as \u201cnon-flammable\u201d according to the criteria of point 1.9, the signal word \u201cWarning\u201d;\n(c) where the aerosol is classified as \u201cflammable\u201d according to the criteria of point 1.9, the signal word \u201cWarning\u201d and the other label elements for \u201cFlammable Aerosols Category 2\u201d provided for in Table 2.3.2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008;\n(d) where the aerosol is classified as \u201cextremely flammable\u201d according to the criteria of point 1.9, the signal word \u201cDanger\u201d and the other label elements for \u201cFlammable Aerosols Category 1\u201d provided for in Table 2.3.2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.", "Transitional provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from the third subparagraph of Article 3(1), aerosol dispensers containing mixtures may be labelled in accordance with Article 1 before 1 June 2015.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from the third subparagraph of Article 3(1), aerosol dispensers containing mixtures and placed on the market before 1 June 2015 are not required to be relabelled in accordance with Article 1 until 1 June 2017.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 19 March 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
