It is therefore in the interest of producers, traders and consumers that marketing standards are applied in respect of eggs.\n(2) The experience gained from the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 of 26 June 1990 on certain marketing standards for eggs\u00a0(2) has made apparent the need for further amendments and simplification. Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(3) The standards should in principle be applicable to all eggs of hens of the species Gallus gallus marketed in the Community. Nevertheless, it appears advisable to give to the Member States the possibility to exempt from the application of those standards eggs sold through certain forms of direct sale from the producer to the final consumer where small quantities are involved.\n(4) A clear distinction should be drawn between eggs suitable for direct human consumption and eggs not suitable for direct human consumption, which are for use in the food or non-food industry. Two quality classes of eggs, Class A and Class B, should therefore be distinguished.\n(5) It should be possible for the consumer to distinguish between eggs of different quality and weight grades and to identify the farming method used in accordance with Commission Directive 2002/4/EC of 30 January 2002 on the registration of establishments keeping laying hens, covered by Council Directive 1999/74/EC\u00a0(3). This requirement should be met by marking eggs and packs.\n(6) Class A eggs should be marked with the distinguishing number of the producer as provided for in Directive 2002/4/EC in order to enable the tracing of eggs placed on the market for human consumption. Class B eggs should also be marked in order to prevent fraudulent practices. However, it should also be possible for Class B eggs to be marked with an indication other than the producer code as long as it allows for the distinction between different quality gradings. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the Member States should be allowed to provide for derogations where class B eggs are marketed exclusively on their territory.\n(7) In order to prevent fraudulent practices, eggs should be marked as early as possible after laying.\n(8) Packing centres that are approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin\u00a0(4) should grade eggs by quality and weight. Packing centres working exclusively for the food and non-food industry should not be required to grade eggs by weight.\n(9) In order to make sure that packing centres are adequately equipped to grade eggs and pack Class A eggs, they should also be authorised by the competent authorities and receive a packing centre code that facilitates the tracing of eggs placed on the market.\n(10) It is essential, in the interest of both producers and consumers, that eggs imported from third countries comply with Community standards. However, special provisions in force in certain third countries may justify derogations from those standards if the equivalence of legislation is guaranteed.\n(11) Member States should designate the inspection services responsible for supervising this Regulation. The procedures for such supervision should be uniform.\n(12) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["Subject-matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down the conditions of marketing within the Community of the eggs produced in the Community or imported from third countries.\nThose conditions of marketing shall also apply to eggs intended for export outside the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may exempt from the requirements of this Regulation, with the exception of Article 4(3), eggs sold directly to the final consumer by the producer:\n(a) on the production site, or\n(b) in a local public market or by door-to-door selling in the region of production of the Member State concerned.\nWhere such exemption is granted, each producer shall be able to choose whether to apply such exemption or not.
