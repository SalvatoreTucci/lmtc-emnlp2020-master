During the consultation the need to ensure that producers are given sufficient time for the appropriate qualification of RIG Faraday rotators with the restriction of lead as laid down by Directive 2002/95/EC emerged. It should therefore be ensured that the health or consumer safety impacts caused by substitution are not likely to outweigh the environmental, health or consumer safety benefits of the substitution, in particular in safety-relevant equipment such as communication systems.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a037, 13.2.2003, p.\u00a019.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0114, 27.4.2006, p.\u00a09.\nANNEX\nIn the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC, point 22 is replaced by the following:\n\u201822.
