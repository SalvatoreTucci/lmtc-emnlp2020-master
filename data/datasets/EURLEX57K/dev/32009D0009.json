That list includes nicotine.\n(3) For nicotine the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 and (EC) No 2229/2004 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. For nicotine the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted in January 2008.\n(4) The Commission examined nicotine in accordance with Article 24a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. A draft review report for that substance was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 26 September 2008 in the format of the Commission review report.\n(5) During the examination of this active substance by the Committee, it was concluded, taking into account comments received from Member States, that the existing evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate a safe use with respect to operators, workers, bystanders and consumers. Moreover, other concerns which were identified by the rapporteur Member State in its assessment report are included in the review report for the substance.\n(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing nicotine satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(7) Nicotine should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing nicotine are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing nicotine should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing nicotine remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.\n(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for nicotine in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(4), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Nicotine shall not be included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that:\n(a) authorisations for plant protection products containing nicotine are withdrawn by 8 June 2009;\n(b) no authorisations for plant protection products containing nicotine are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.", "Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 8 June 2010 at the latest.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0168, 27.6.2002, p.\u00a014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0379, 24.12.2004, p.\u00a013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a015, 18.1.2008, p.\u00a05."}
