Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.\n(2) The quota amount for certain autonomous Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. Consequently, these quota amounts should be increased.\n(3) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities on the role of national parliaments in the European Union.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The quotas listed in the Annex are hereby added to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 with effect from 1 July 2004.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2004, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, the quota amount of the tariff quota 09.2950 is fixed at 8\u00a0400\u00a0tonnes.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
