The installation to the vehicles within the scope of the Directive was implemented by 1 January 1996.\n(2) Directive 96/96/EC does not include a requirement to carry out functional checking of RSL systems, i.e. the ability for the device to effectively control the vehicle's maximum speed.\n(3) This amending Directive requires the authorities to carry out a test that will ensure that the RSL functions correctly.\n(4) Today simple, common diagnostic systems are available that can be used by testing organisations to test the vast majority of the speed limiters equipped. For those vehicles that are not accessible by such readily available diagnostic tools, the authorities will need to either make use of available equipment from the original vehicle manufacturer or provide for the acceptance of appropriate test certification from the vehicle manufacturer or their franchise organisation.\n(5) In the future, periodic verification of the correct functioning of the speed limiter will be facilitated for the vehicles that are fitted with the new recording equipment (digital tachograph) according to Council Regulation (EC) No 2135/98 of 24 September 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and Directive 88/599/EEC concerning the application of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85(4). New vehicles will be fitted with such equipment from the year 2003.\n(6) The provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directive on motor vehicle roadworthiness testing established under Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,", "main_body": ["A fourth indent is added to point 7.10 of Annex II to Directive 96/96/EC as follows:\n\"- check wherever practical that the set speed of the speed limitation device conforms to the limits according to Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 92/6/EEC and that the speed limitation device prevents vehicles mentioned in those same Articles from exceeding those pre-set values.\"", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive two years after the entry into force of the Directive at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
