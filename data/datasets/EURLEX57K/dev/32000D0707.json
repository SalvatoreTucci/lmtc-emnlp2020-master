However the transfer of antigen from Pirbright Institute for Animal Health to Merial SAS, Pirbright was delayed for technical reasons and thereby Pirbright Institute for Animal Health, continued to provide to the Community the services of an antigen bank until the transfer was completed on 28 June 2000.\n(5) The functions and duties of these antigen banks are specified in Article 4 of Decision 91/666/EEC and community assistance must be conditional on accomplishment of these.\n(6) Community financial assistance should be granted to the banks providing services to the Community to enable them to carry out during 2000 the said functions and duties.\n(7) For budgetary reasons the Community assistance should be granted for a period of one year.\n(8) For financial control purposes Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 should apply.\n(9) Commission Decision 2000/112/EC should be amended in order to take account of the delayed transfer of antigen from Pirbright Institute For Animal Health to Merial SAS, Pirbright, United Kingdom.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
