That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of fumonisin esterase produced by Komagataella pastoris (DSM 26643)as a feed additive for pigs, to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) in its opinion of 8 April 2014\u00a0(2) concluded that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of fumonisin esterase produced by Komagataella pastoris (DSM\u00a026643) does not have adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It also concluded that it has the capacity to biotransform fumonisins to less toxic compounds in contaminated feed for pigs. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of a fumonisin esterase produced by Komagataella pastoris (DSM 26643) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018substances for the reduction of the contamination of feed by mycotoxins\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(5):3667.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nTechnological additives: substances for reduction of the contamination of feed by mycotoxins: fumonisins\n1.
