Outbreaks of classical swine fever have also occurred in pig holdings in Rhineland-Pfalz in 2001 and 2002, probably related with the disease in feral pigs.\n(4) In accordance with Articles 16 and 20 of Directive 2001/89/EC, German authorities have submitted plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs in Saarland and for an emergency vaccination of the feral pigs in Rhineland-Pfalz and Saarland.\n(5) German authorities have authorised the use of a live attenuated vaccine against classical swine fever (C strain) to be used for the immunisation of feral pigs by means of oral baits.\n(6) In this context vaccination of feral pigs is considered to be an effective tool to supplement other disease control measures.\n(7) The submitted plans have been examined and found to comply with the provisions of Directive 2001/89/EC.\n(8) It is appropriate to establish further detailed conditions on trade of live pigs and certain pig products from the areas of Germany in which the evolution of the disease will probably be influenced by the vaccination.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The plan submitted by Germany for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs in Saarland is hereby approved.", "The plans submitted by Germany for emergency vaccination of feral pigs in Rhineland-Pfalz and Saarland are hereby approved.", "1.
