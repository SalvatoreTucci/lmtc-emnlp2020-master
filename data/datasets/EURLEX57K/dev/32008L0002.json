The reference point is situated in the plane parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the tractor and passing through the centre of the seat, 700 mm vertically above the line of intersection of that plane and the surface of the seat and 270 mm in the direction of the pelvic support from the vertical plane passing through the front edge of the surface of the seat and perpendicular to the longitudinal median plane of the tractor (Figure 1). The reference point thus determined relates to the seat when unoccupied and fitted in the central position specified by the tractor manufacturer.\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Semi-circle of vision\n\u2018Semi-circle of vision\u2019 means the semi-circle described by a radius of 12 m about a point situated in the horizontal plane of the road vertically below the reference point, in such a way that, when facing the direction of motion, the arc of the semi-circle lies in front of the tractor, while the diameter bounding the semi-circle is at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the tractor (Figure 2).\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Masking effect\n\u2018Masking effect\u2019 means the chords of the sectors of the semi-circle of vision which cannot be seen owing to structural components such as roof-pillars, air intakes or exhaust stacks and the frame of the windscreen.\n1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sector of vision\n\u2018Sector of vision\u2019 means that part of the field of vision bounded:\n1.5.1. at the top,\n1.5.2. in the plane of the road,\n1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swept area of the windscreen wipers\n\u2018Swept area of the windscreen wipers\u2019 means the area of the outer surface of the windscreen swept by the windscreen wipers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUIREMENTS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nThe tractor shall be constructed and equipped in such a way that, in road traffic and in farm and forest use, the driver has an adequate field of vision, under all the usual conditions pertaining to highway use and to work undertaken in fields and forests. The field of vision is considered adequate when the driver has, as far as possible, a view of part of each front wheel and when the following requirements are fulfilled.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Checking of the field of vision\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure for determining masking effects\n2.2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tractor must be placed on a horizontal surface as shown in Figure 2. On a horizontal support level with the reference point, there must be mounted two point sources of light, e.g. 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150 W, 12\u00a0V, 65\u00a0mm apart and symmetrically located with respect to the reference point. The support must be rotatable at its centre point about a vertical axis passing through the reference point. For the purpose of measuring the masking effects, the support must be so aligned that the line joining the two light sources is perpendicular to the line joining the masking component and the reference point.\nThe silhouette (deepest shadow) overlaps projected on to the semi-circle of vision by the masking component when the light sources are switched on simultaneously or alternately must be measured in accordance with point 1.4 (Figure 3).\n2.2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Masking effects must not exceed 700\u00a0mm.\n2.2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Masking effects due to adjacent structural components over 80\u00a0mm in width must be so configured that there is an interval of not less than 2\u00a0200\u00a0mm \u2014 measured as a chord of the semi-circle of vision \u2014 between the centres of two masking effects.\n2.2.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There may be no more than six masking effects in the semi-circle of vision and no more than two inside the sector of vision defined in point 1.5.\n2.2.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside the sector of vision, masking effects exceeding 700\u00a0mm but not exceeding 1\u00a0500\u00a0mm are, however, permissible if the components causing them cannot be redesigned or relocated: on each side there may be a total of either two such masking effects, one not exceeding 700 mm and the other not exceeding 1\u00a0500\u00a0mm, or two such masking effects, neither exceeding 1\u00a0200\u00a0mm.\n2.2.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blind spots caused by type-approved rear-view mirrors may be disregarded if the design of these mirrors is such that they cannot be installed in any other way.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mathematical determination of masking effects for binocular vision:\n2.2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as an alternative to the procedure set out in point 2.2.1, the acceptability of individual masking effects can be determined mathematically. The requirements of points 2.2.1.2 to 2.2.1.6 shall apply in respect of the size, distribution and number of the masking effects;\n2.2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for binocular vision with an inter-ocular distance of 65\u00a0mm, the masking effect expressed in mm is given by the formula:\nin which:\na is the distance in millimetres between the component obstructing vision and the reference point measured along the visual radius joining the reference point, the centre of the component and the perimeter of the semi-circle of vision; and\nb is the width in millimetres of the component obstructing vision measured horizontally and perpendicular to the visual radius.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The test methods referred to under point 2.2 may be replaced by others if the latter can be shown to be equivalent.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transparent area of the windscreen\nFor the purpose of determining the masking effects in the sector of vision, the masking effects due to the frame of the windscreen and to any other obstacle may, in accordance with the provisions of point 2.2.1.4, be considered as a single effect, provided that the distance between the outermost points of this masking effect does not exceed 700\u00a0mm.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Windscreen wipers\n2.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tractors fitted with windscreens must also be equipped with motor-driven windscreen wipers. The area swept by these wipers must ensure an unobstructed forward view corresponding to a chord of the semi-circle of vision at least 8\u00a0m long within the sector of vision.\n2.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate of operation of the windscreen wipers must be at least 20 cycles per minute.\nANNEX II\nPART A\nRepealed Directive with its successive amendments (referred to in Article 6)\nCouncil Directive 74/347/EEC\nCommission Directive 79/1073/EEC\nCouncil Directive 82/890/EEC Only as regards the references to Directive 74/347/EEC in Article 1(1)\nDirective 97/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Only as regards the references to Directive 74/347/EEC in the first indent of Article 1\nPART B\nList of time-limits for transposition into national law and application (referred to in Article 6)\nDirective Time-limit for transposition Date of application\n74/347/EEC 2 January 1976\u00a0(1)\n79/1073/EEC 30 April 1980\n82/890/EEC 22 June 1984\n97/54/EC 22 September 1998 23 September 1998\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0In compliance with Article 3a, inserted by point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 79/1073/EEC:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 May 1980 no Member State may, on grounds relating to the field of vision of tractors:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of tractor, to grant EEC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC, or to grant national type-approval,\n\u2014 or prohibit the entry into service of tractors,\nif the field of vision of this type of tractor or of these tractors complies with the provisions of this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 October 1980 Member States:\n\u2014 may no longer issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC in respect of a type of tractor in which the field of vision does not comply with the provisions of this Directive,\n\u2014 may refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of a type of tractor whose field of vision does not comply with the provisions of this Directive.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 January 1983, Member States may prohibit the entry into service of any tractor whose field of vision does not comply with the provisions of this Directive.\u2019\nANNEX III\nCORRELATION TABLE\nDirective 74/347/EEC This Directive\nArticles 1 to 3 Articles 1 to 3\nArticle 3a Table note\u00a0(*), Annex II\nArticle 4 Article 4\nArticle 5(1) \u2014\nArticle 5(2) Article 5\n\u2014 Articles 6 and 7\nArticle 6 Article 8\nAnnex Annex I\nAnnex, points 1 to 2.3 Annex I, points 1 to 2.3\nAnnex, point 2.4 \u2014\nAnnex, point 2.5 Annex I, point 2.4\nAnnex, point 2.6 Annex I, point 2.5\nAnnex, figures 1, 2 and 3 Annex I, figures 1, 2 and 3\n\u2014 Annex II\n\u2014 Annex III"}
