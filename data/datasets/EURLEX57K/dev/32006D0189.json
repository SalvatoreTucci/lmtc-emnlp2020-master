Approximately 2\u00a0000 farms and 60\u00a0000 livestock units corresponding respectively to 3\u00a0% of farms and 4\u00a0% of livestock units are potentially encompassed by the derogation.\n(4) The Austrian legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.\n(5) The Third Report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive 2000-2003 in Austria shows that the average winter nitrate concentrations in surface waters were below 25\u00a0mg/l at all monitoring points. The average concentration of all sites was 5,8\u00a0mg/l NO3. Average nitrate concentration in groundwater was 19,6\u00a0mg/l. In 74\u00a0% of the sites the average concentration was lower than 25\u00a0mg/l. None of the Austrian lakes is euthrophic. Trend analysis shows that water quality is stable in the majority of the sampling points.\n(6) The number of livestock and the utilisation of mineral fertiliser decreased substantially in the period 1990-2003, with a reduction of 21\u00a0% in cattle, 12\u00a0% in pig and 6\u00a0% in poultry number. In the period 2000-2002 nitrogen application was on average, respectively 47,8\u00a0kg per hectare and 35,4\u00a0kg per hectare per year from livestock manure and from chemical fertilisers, which represent among the lowest figures in the EU, with a trend towards reduction respectively of 7\u00a0% and 5\u00a0% compared to the period 1996/1999.\n(7) Austria, in conformity with Article 3(5) of Directive 91/676/EEC, applies an action programme throughout its whole territory.\n(8) The supporting documents presented in the Austrian notification show that the proposed amount of 230\u00a0kg per hectare per year of nitrogen from cattle manure is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\n(9) The Commission after examination of Austrian\u2019s request considers that the proposed amount of 230\u00a0kg per hectare per year nitrogen from cattle manure will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(10) This Decision should be applicable in connection with the present action programme expiring by the end of 2007.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["The derogation requested by Austria by letter of 3 November 2005, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018cattle farms\u2019 means holdings with more than three livestock units, where at least two-thirds of livestock are cattle,\n(b) \u2018grass\u2019 means permanent or temporary grassland (generally temporary lies less than four years),\n(c) \u2018crops being undersown by grass\u2019: silage cereals, silage maize to be undersown before (maize) or after harvest, by grass which will act as a catch crop, for biological retention of nitrogen residual during winter,\n(d) \u2018beets\u2019 means forage beets.", "Scope\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis and subject to the conditions set out in Articles 4, 5 and 6 to cattle farms where the crop rotation includes more than 70\u00a0% of particularly nitrogen consuming crops, with a long growing season.", "Annual authorisation and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farmers who want to benefit from a derogation shall submit an application to the competent authorities annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the annual application referred to in paragraph 1 they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.", "Application of manure and other fertilisers\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of livestock manure applied to the land each year on cattle farms, including by the animals themselves, shall not exceed the amount of manure containing 230\u00a0kg of nitrogen per hectare, subject to the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 8.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total nitrogen inputs shall comply with the nutrient demand of the considered crop and the supply from the soil.
