However for the 2003/2004 import season the entry into the Community of such tubers is permitted from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 and subject to specific conditions.\n(2) During the 2003/2004 import season, a number of interceptions of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith were recorded and Egypt itself decided to ban all exports of Egyptian potatoes to the Community as of 9 April 2004.\n(3) The situation was reassessed. Egypt informed the Commission that stringent measures are taken against producers, inspectors, exporters and packing stations which violate Egyptian instructions on the export of potatoes destined for the Community. Additional measures were taken with regard to the identification of the pest-free areas, the reduction of the period of validity of the Phytosanitary Certificate from 15 to 7 days, an increase of the number of inspectors, stricter rules on the labelling of bags and stringent rules on companies who want to export potatoes to the Community.\n(4) In the light of the information provided by Egypt, the Commission has established that there is no risk of spreading Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith with the entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. from pest-free areas of Egypt, provided that specific conditions are satisfied. The entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L., originating in Egypt, should therefore be permitted for the 2004/2005 import season.\n(5) In addition, certain textual errors should be corrected.\n(6) Decision 2004/4/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/4/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
