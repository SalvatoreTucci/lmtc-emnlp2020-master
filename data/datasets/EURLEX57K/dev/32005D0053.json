Other frequencies allocated for maritime communications may be available to the AIS. All radio equipment operating on those frequencies should be compatible with the designated use of these frequencies and it should provide a reasonable guarantee of assurance that it will function correctly in times of operation.\n(5) The scope of Commission Decision 2003/213/EC of 25 March 2003 on application of Article 3(3)(e) of Directive 1999/5/EC to marine communication equipment intended to be used on non-SOLAS vessels and which is intended to participate in the Automatic Identification System (AIS)\u00a0(2) is limited to equipment which is intended to be used on non-SOLAS vessels. It is considered that a high level of safety can only be achieved if all equipment used on non-SOLAS vessels and corresponding land-stations participating in the AIS system functions correctly. Therefore the same requirements should apply to all AIS stations.\n(6) In the interests of legal clarity and transparency Decision 2003/213/EC should therefore be replaced.\n(7) This decision should only apply after a period of time sufficient to allow manufacturers to align their production of equipment in accordance with the new essential requirement.\n(8) The measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Telecommunications Conformity Assessment and Market Surveillance Committee,", "main_body": ["Radio equipment which operates in the maritime mobile service as defined in Article 1.28 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Regulations, or in the maritime mobile satellite service as defined in Article 1.29 of the ITU Radio Regulations shall comply with the essential requirements set out in Article 3(3)(e) of Directive 1999/5/EC.\nTo that end such equipment shall be designed in such a way as to ensure that it operates correctly in its intended environment when used on non-SOLAS vessels and land-stations and it shall meet all the appropriate operational requirements of the Automatic Identification System (AIS).", "Decision 2003/213/EC is repealed with effect from the date referred to in Article 3.", "This Decision shall apply as from 26 July 2005", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10.
