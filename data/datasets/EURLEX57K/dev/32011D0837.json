The above figure resulted from data which had been supplied by Slovenia to the Commission. Slovenia was informed that any recoveries of those amounts made after 23 June 2009 shall neither be declared nor reimbursed to the Commission.\n(2) When submitting the final declaration of expenditure and final payment claim to the European Commission for the closure of the Transitional Rural Development programmes Slovenia incorrectly included amounts recovered and which were subjected to the abovementioned financial correction in their final declarations. On the basis of the amounts supplied by Slovenia, the Commission Decision 2009/984/EU\u00a0(4) laying down the final balance to be paid or recovered at programme closure in the field of transitional rural development programmes financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) by the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia was adopted.\n(3) After receipt of the recovery order for the correction from Decision 2010/399/EU Slovenia informed the Commission that part of the correction has been already deducted in Decision 2009/984/EU. After a thorough analysis and confirmation by the Slovenia Paying Agency\u2019s Certification Body, an overlap of EUR\u00a02\u00a0170\u00a0331,88 was confirmed.\n(4) Therefore Slovenia is liable to the Commission only for the difference between the amount of the original correction of EUR\u00a02\u00a0280\u00a0860 in Decision 2010/399/EU and the amount of the recoveries declared in Decision 2009/984/EU of EUR\u00a02\u00a0170\u00a0331,88. This difference equals EUR\u00a0110\u00a0528,12.
