whereas these schemes rank as intervention within the meaning of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and constitute a common measure within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of that Regulation ; whereas it is therefore necessary to include Guidance Section expenditure when clearing the accounts in respect of expenditure financed by the EAGGF;\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be drawn in any subsequent clearance of accounts in respect of national aid or infringements for which the procedures started under Articles 93 and 169 of the Treaty are now being implemented or were terminated after 18 July 1989 or to any consequences relating to infringements committed in 1988 or to national aid incompatible with the Treaty paid in 1988 and liable to affect EAGGF expenditure during a year subsequent to 1988.\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences resulting, during a subsequent accounts clearance procedure taken by the Commission, from current investigations underway at the time of this Decision, from irregularities within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 or from judgments of the Court of Justice in cases now pending and relating to matters covered by this Decision;\nWhereas, as the clearance of accounts concerning food aid operations had not yet been concluded, the financial consequences for the Guarantee Section will be determined during a subsequent clearance of accounts,", "main_body": ["The Member States' accounts concerning expenditure financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section in respect of 1988 are hereby cleared as indicated in the Annex of this Decision.", "The amounts arising under point 3 in column (c) of the Annex are to be taken into account as part of the expenditure referred to in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2773/88 (3) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 775/90 (4), for the month following that of the notification of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 1990.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 131, 26.5.1977, p. 1.
