MEASURING APPARATUS\nThe measuring equipment shall comply with the requirements of Publication No 2 (first edition, 1961) of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) or with the specifications applicable to peak type measuring apparatus given in CISPR Publication No 5 (first edition, 1967).\nNote : Where the available equipment does not fully meet all the CISPR specifications, discrepancies must be clearly stated.\n2. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS >PIC FILE= \"T0010808\">\n3. MEASURING SITE\nThe measuring site shall be a level area free from appreciable wave-reflecting surfaces within an ellipse having a major axis of 20 m and a minor axis of 17 73 m. The antenna and the centre of the engine must be located on the major axis of the ellipse, the plane of symmetry of the vehicle being parallel to the minor axis. The antenna and the point of intersection of the side of the engine nearest to the antenna with the major axis must each be located at a focal point of the ellipse. The measuring set, or the test hut or vehicle in which the set is located, may be within the ellipse but horizontally not closer than 3 m to the antenna, in a direction opposite to the vehicle being measured. Furthermore, the absence of any extraneous noise or signal which could materially affect the measurement must be ensured ; a check is therefore made, with the engine stopped, before and after taking the measurements, which can be considered satisfactory only if the readings are at least 10 dB above the highest obtained at the pre- and post-measurement checks.\n4. VEHICLE   4.1 Only the ancillary electrical equipment necessary for the running of the engine shall be operating.\n4.2 The engine shall be at its normal operating temperature. During each measurement, the engine shall be operated as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0010809\">\n4.3 Measurements shall not be made while rain is falling on the vehicle or within 10 minutes after rain has stopped.\n5. ANTENNA   5.1 Height\nThe centre of the dipole shall be 3 m above the ground.\n5.2 Distance of measurement\nThe horizontal distance from the antenna to the nearest metal part of the vehicle shall be 10 m.\n5.3 Antenna location relative to vehicle\nThe antenna shall be placed successively on the left- and right-hand sides of the vehicle, at two positions of measurement, with the aerial parallel to the plane of symmetry of the vehicle and in line with the engine. (See Appendix to this Annex.)\n5.4 Antenna position\nAt each of the measuring points, readings shall be taken with the dipole in a horizontal and in a vertical position. (See Appendix to this Annex.)\n5.5 Readings\nThe maximum of four readings shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.\n6. FREQUENCIES\nMeasurements shall be made within the 40 to 250 MHz range. A vehicle is considered as very likely to meet the required suppression limits over the whole frequency range if it meets them at the following six frequencies : 45, 65, 90, 150, 180 and 220 (\u00b1 5 MHz). (The 5 MHz tolerance for the six frequencies chosen should make it possible to avoid interference from transmissions operating on the nominal frequencies.)\nAppendix ANTENNA DIRECTION RELATIVE TO VEHICLE\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010810\">\nANNEX III STATISTICAL METHOD OF CHECKING RADIO INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION\nIn order to ensure with an 80 % probability that 80 % of the vehicles conform to a specified limit L, the following condition must be satisfied: >PIC FILE= \"T0010811\">\nIf a first sample of n vehicles does not meet the specification, a second sample of n vehicles shall be tested and the overall results assessed as coming from a sample of 2n vehicles.\nANNEX IV\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010812\">"}
