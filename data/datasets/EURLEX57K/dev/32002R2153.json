The new provisions of this system are set out in the appendix to Annex C(b) to Council Regulation (EC) No 1361/2002(2) for Lithuania and the appendix to Annex C(b) to Council Regulation (EC) No 1362/2002(3) for Latvia.\n(2) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, the minimum import prices currently set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1599/97(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 538/2000(5), should no longer be shown in that Annex. It is, however, necessary to indicate the Community legislation under which these prices are fixed. Depending on the third country in question, this may be a Council regulation establishing concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with the country concerned, or the relevant provisions of the Europe Agreement with that country.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1599/97 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1599/97 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
