It should therefore be specified that all sweet peppers are varieties (cultivars) grown from Capsicum annuum L. var. annuum, and the derogation with respect to the minimum size for Capsicum annuum L. var. longum, also known as \"peperoncini\", should be deleted.\n(3) Sales of small elongated sweet peppers (pointed) are growing. The minimum size applicable to this type of pepper should therefore be lowered.\n(4) Where sweet peppers are presented in a mixture of colours, uniformity of origin is not required. It is therefore necessary to provide, where appropriate, for indication of the different countries of origin.\n(5) Sales of miniature peppers have grown in recent years. Special provisions concerning sizing should therefore be laid down for those products, which are below the minimum size, along with the corresponding provisions concerning labelling and presentation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1455/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
