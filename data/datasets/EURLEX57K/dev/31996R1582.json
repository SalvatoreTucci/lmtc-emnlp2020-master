In the introductory lines of Article 4 (1) the words 'produced in the Community` shall be deleted.\n2. In Article 7 (a) and (b) the words 'of Community origin` shall be deleted.\n3. Article 9 shall be replaced by the following:\n'Article 9\nThe placing in free circulation in the Community of olive oil falling within CN code 1509 10 originating in Tunisia and imported under special arrangements within a quantity ceiling shall be subject to the lodging of a security. The amount of this security shall be equal to the part of the consumption aid which would be paid to the packaging plants for the same quantity of olive oil and which obtains when the customs formalities for placing the oil in free circulation are completed. However, in the event of a decision entailing a substantial alteration in the consumption aid, the Commission may adjust, as from the data of that decision, the amount of the security to take account of the alteration in question. The security shall be released as soon as the party concerned provides proof that the olive oil in question has been made ineligible for consumption aid and for the production refund referred to in Article 20a of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 1996.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 1996.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.
