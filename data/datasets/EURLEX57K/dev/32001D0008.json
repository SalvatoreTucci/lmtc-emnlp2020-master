Collection of samples\nThe competent authority shall ensure that samples ae collected using the methods and protocols laid down in the Manual of standards for diagnostic tests and vaccines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties), latest edition. In the absence of such methods and protocols, the competent authority shall ensure that the samples are collected in a manner appropriate for the correct application of tests.\nThe competent authority shall ensure that samples are correctly marked as to the identity of the sampled animal.\n2. Laboratory testing\n2.1. Suspect cases\nTissues from bovine animals sent for laboratory testing pursuant to the provisions of Article 3(2) shall be subject to a histopathology examination as laid down in the Manual of standards for diagnostic tests and vaccines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epiziooties), latest edition, except where the material is autolysed. Where the result of the histopathology examination is inconclusive or negative or where the material autolysed, the tissues shall be subjected to an examination by one of the other diagnostic methods laid down in the above Manual (immunocytochemistry, immuno-blotting or demonstration of characteristic fibrils by electron microscopy).\n2.2. Animals examined in the framework of the annual monitoring programme or subject to routine examination at slaughter\nBovine animals examined in the framework of the annual monitoring programme as laid down in Annex I(A), the targeted surveillance programme as laid down in Annex I(C) or examined in accordance with Article 1 of Decision 2000/764/EC shall be examined in an approved laboratory by one of the tests listed in Annex IVA.\nWhere the result of the monitoring test is inconclusive or positive, the tissues shall immediately be subject to confirmatory examinations in an official laboratory. The confirmatory examination shall start by a hystopathology examination of the brainstem as laid down in the Manual of standards for diagnostic tests and vaccines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties), latest edition, except where the material is autolysed or otherwise not suitable for examination by histopathology. Where the result of the histopathology examination is inconclusive or negative or where the material is autolysed, the tissues shall be subjected to an examination by one of the other diagnostic methods mentioned in point 2.1, however, the method must not be the same as the method used in the monitoring test.\n3. Interpretation of results\nAn animal examined as referred to in point 2.1 shall be regarded a positive BSE case, if the result of one of the tests is positive.\nAn animal examined as referred to in point 2.2 shall be regarded as a positive BSE case if the result of the monitoring test is positive or inconclusive, and\n- the result of the subsequent histopathology examination is positive, or\n- the result of another diagnostic method mentioned in point 2.1. is positive.\n4. Reporting of results\nAll positive BSE cases shall immediately be reported to the competent authority. The competent authority shall notify positive BSE cases in accordance with Directive 82/894/EEC(1).\n(1) OJ L 378, 31.12.1982, p. 58.\nANNEX IVA\n1.
