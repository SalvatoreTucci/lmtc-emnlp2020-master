However, in previous years including the 2008/2009 import season, the entry into the Community of such tubers was permitted from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 and subject to specific conditions.\n(2) During the 2008/2009 import season, six interceptions of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith were recorded resulting in a prohibition on all exports of Egyptian potatoes to the Community as of 26\u00a0August 2009.\n(3) Egypt has submitted a report on the causes of these interceptions. The main conclusion is that the majority of interceptions are due to failures to comply with the phytosanitary instructions regarding the production and export of potatoes destined for the Community. Potato production zones involved in the non-compliances are no longer eligible for export to the European Union. Egypt has imposed penalties for the infringement of its instructions and suspended the relevant companies for the next three exporting seasons.\n(4) As requested by Egypt and in the light of the information provided by it, the Commission has established that the risk of spreading Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith with the entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt has been sufficiently mitigated, provided that certain conditions are satisfied.\n(5) The entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L., originating in \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt, should therefore be permitted for the 2009/2010 import season.\n(6) Decision 2004/4/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/4/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, paragraph 1, \u20182008/2009\u2019 is replaced by \u20182009/2010\u2019;\n2. in Article 4, \u201831\u00a0August 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831\u00a0August 2010\u2019;\n3. in Article 7, \u201830\u00a0September 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201830\u00a0September 2010\u2019;\n4. the Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) in point 1(b)(iii), \u20182008/2009\u2019 is replaced by \u20182009/2010\u2019;\n(b) in the second indent of point 1(b)(iii), \u20181\u00a0January 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u20181\u00a0January 2010\u2019;\n(c) in point 1(b)(xii), \u20181\u00a0January 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u20181\u00a0January 2010\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0169, 10.7.2000, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a02, 6.1.2004, p.\u00a050."}
