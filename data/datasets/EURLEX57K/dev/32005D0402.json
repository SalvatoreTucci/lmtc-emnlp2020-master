Those substances have been found in chilli and chilli products as well as curcuma or palm oil. All findings were notified through the Rapid Alert System for food and feed pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(3) Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III and Scarlet red (Sudan IV) have been classified as category 3 carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\n(4) The extent of the findings points to an adulteration constituting a serious health risk.\n(5) Given the seriousness of the health threat, it is necessary to maintain the measures provided for in Decision 2004/92/EC and to extend them to curcuma and palm oil. Moreover, account should be taken of the possibility of triangular trade, especially for food products for which there is no official certification of origin. In order to protect public health, it is appropriate to require that consignments of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil imported into the Community in whatever form, intended for human consumption, should be accompanied by an analytical report provided by the importer or food business operator concerned demonstrating that the consignment does not contain Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III or Scarlet red (Sudan IV).\n(6) The analytical report accompanying the consignments of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil should be an original document endorsed by the competent authorities from the country emitting the document. These measures aim to improve the guarantees offered by the document.\n(7) Member States should also be required to carry out random sampling and analysis of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil presented for importation or already on the market.\n(8) It is appropriate to order the destruction of adulterated chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil to avoid their introduction into the food chain.\n(9) Since the measures provided for in this Decision have an impact on the control resources of the Member States, the results of these measures should be reviewed within 12 months in order to assess whether they are still necessary for the protection of public health.\n(10) That review should take account of the results of all analyses carried out by the competent authorities.\n(11) Transitional measures are necessary for consignments of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil imported before the date of publication of this Decision.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018chilli\u2019, fruits of the genus Capsicum, dried and crushed or ground within CN Code 0904\u00a020\u00a090, in whatever form, intended for human consumption and\n(b) \u2018chilli products\u2019, curry powder within CN Code 0910\u00a050, in whatever form, intended for human consumption and\n(c) \u2018curcuma\u2019, curcuma dried and crushed or ground within CN Code 0910\u00a030, in whatever form, intended for human consumption and\n(d) \u2018palm oil\u2019, palm oil within CN Code 1511\u00a010\u00a090, intended for direct human consumption.", "Imports conditions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall prohibit the import of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil unless an original analytical report accompanying the consignment demonstrates that the product does not contain any of the following chemical substances:\n(a) Sudan I (CAS Number 842-07-9),\n(b) Sudan II (CAS Number 3118-97-6),\n(c) Sudan III (CAS Number 85-86-9),\n(d) Scarlet Red or Sudan IV (CAS Number 85-83-6).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The analytical report shall be endorsed by a representative of the relevant competent authority.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities in the Member States shall check that each consignment of chilli, chilli products, curcuma and palm oil presented for importation is accompanied by an analytical report as provided for in paragraph 1.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of such an analytical report as provided for in paragraph 1, the importer established in the Community shall have the product tested to demonstrate that it does not contain one or more of the chemical substances referred to in paragraph 1.
