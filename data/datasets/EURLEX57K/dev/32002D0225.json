It applies to bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods that are intended for immediate human consumption or for further processing before consumption.", "The maximum level of okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and pectenotoxins together in the animals referred to in Article 1 (the whole body or any part edible separately) shall be 160 \u03bcg of okadaic acid equivalents/kg.

Sensitivity and selectivity depend on the choice of the solvents used for the extraction and purification steps and this should be taken into account when making a decision on the method to be used, in order to cover the full range of toxins.\nA single mouse bioassay involving acetone extraction can be used to detect okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins and yessotoxins. This assay may be complemented if necessary with liquid/liquid partition steps with ethyl acetate/water or dichloromethane/water to remove potential interferences. Azaspiracids detection at the regulatory levels by means of this procedure requires the use of the whole body as the test portion.\nThree mice should be used for each test. The death of two out of three mice within 24 hours after inoculation into each of them of an extract equivalent to 5 g of hepatopancreas or 25 g whole body should be considered as a positive result for the presence of one or more of the toxins mentioned in Article 1 at levels above those established in Article 2, 3 and 4.\nA mouse bioassay with acetone extraction followed by liquid/liquid partition with diethylether can be used to detect okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins and azaspiracids but it cannot be used to detect yessotoxins as losses of these toxins may take place during the partition step. Three mice should be used for each test. The death of two out of three mice within 24 hours after inoculation into each of them of an extract equivalent to 5 g of hepatopancreas or 25 g whole body should be considered as a positive result for the presence of okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins and azaspiracids at levels above those established in Article 2 and 4.\nThe rat bioassay can detect okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and azaspiracids. Three rats should be used for each test. A diarrhetic response in any of the three rats is considered a positive result for the presence of okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and azaspiracids at levels above those mentioned in Article 2 and 4.\nAlternative detection methods\nA series of methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection, liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS), inmunoassays and functional assays such as the phosphatase inhibition assay can be used as alternative or complementary methods to the biological testing methods, provided that either alone or combined they can detect at least the following analogues, that they are not less effective than the biological methods and that their implementation provides an equivalent level of public health protection:\n- okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins: an hydrolysis step may be required in order to detect the presence of DTX3,\n- pectenotoxins: PTX1 and PTX2,\n- yessotoxins: YTX, 45 OH YTX, homo YTX, and 45 OH homo YTX,\n- azaspiracids: AZA1, AZA2 and AZA3.\nIf new analogues of public health significance are discovered they should be included in the analysis. Standards will have to be available before chemical analysis will be possible. Total toxicity will be calculated using conversion factors based on the toxicity data available for each toxin.\nThe performance characteristics of these methods should be defined after validation following an internationally agreed protocol."}
