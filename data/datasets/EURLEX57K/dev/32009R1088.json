That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the enzyme preparation of 6-phytase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594) as a feed additive for weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, poultry for fattening and poultry for laying, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for ten years by Commission Regulation (EC) No 270/2009\u00a0(2) for chickens for fattening.\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, poultry for fattening and poultry for laying. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 14 May 2009\u00a0(3) that the enzyme preparation of 6-phytase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 17594) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that the use of that preparation improves the digestibility of dietary phosphorus. The Authority did not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulation (EC) No 270/2009 should be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Regulation (EC) No 270/2009 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 3.4.2009, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1097, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
