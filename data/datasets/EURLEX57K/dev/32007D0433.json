However, a report of a pest risk assessment based on limited available scientific information has demonstrated that the specified organism can cause significant mortality on Pinus spp. and tree damage on Pseudotsuga menziesii. These plants are widely distributed in Europe and the susceptibility of several species is high. It is therefore necessary to take forthwith provisional measures against the introduction into and spread within the Community of the specified organism.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision should apply to the introduction or the spread of the specified organism, the demarcation of infested areas within the Community and the control of the specified organism in these areas, the import, production and movement of the specified plants, including seeds, within the Community, and a survey for the presence or continued absence of the specified organism in the Member States.\n(5) It is appropriate that the results of the measures be regularly assessed in 2007 and 2008 in particular on the basis of information to be provided by the Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment.\n(6) Member States should adapt, if necessary, their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(7) The results of the measures should be reviewed by 1 April 2008.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision:\n1. \u2018specified organism\u2019 means Gibberella circinata Nirenberg & O\u2019Donnell;\n2. \u2018specified plants\u2019 means plants of the genus Pinus L. and the species Pseudotsuga menziesii, intended for planting, including seeds and cones for propagation purposes;\n3. \u2018place of production\u2019 means:\n\u2014 any premises or collection of fields operated as a single production unit of plants; this may include production sites which are separately managed for phytosanitary purposes, or\n\u2014 a demarcated forestry stand.", "Measures against the specified organism\nThe introduction into and spread within the Community of the specified organism shall be prohibited.", "Import of the specified plants\nThe specified plants may be introduced into the Community only if:\n(a) they comply with the requirements laid down in section I of Annex I, and\n(b) they are, on entry into the Community, inspected and, where appropriate, tested for the presence of the specified organism, in accordance with Article 13a(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, and found free from it.", "Movement of the specified plants within the Community\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Annex II, section II of this Decision, the specified plants originating in the Community or imported into the Community pursuant to Article 3 of this Decision may only be moved within the Community, if they meet the conditions laid down in section II of Annex I.", "Surveys and notifications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism or evidence of infection by this organism in their territory.\nWithout prejudice to Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of those surveys, together with the list of demarcated areas referred to in Article 6 and the measures referred to in section II of Annex II, shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States by 15 December of each year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any suspected occurrence or confirmed presence of the specified organism shall immediately be notified to the responsible official bodies.", "Establishment of demarcated areas\nWhen the results of the surveys referred to in Article 5.1 or the notification referred to in Article 5.2 confirm the presence of the specified organism in an area, or there is evidence of the establishment of this organism by other means, Member States shall define demarcated areas and take official measures as laid down in sections I and II respectively of Annex II.", "Compliance\nMember States shall, if necessary, amend the measures which they have adopted to protect themselves against the introduction and spread of the specified organism in such a manner that those measures comply with this Decision and shall forthwith inform the Commission of those measures.", "Review\nThis Decision shall be reviewed by 31 March 2008 at the latest.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
