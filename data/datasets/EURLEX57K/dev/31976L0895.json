(2) OJ No C 40, 25.3.1969, p. 4.   Whereas, where Member States fix maximum content levels for products marketed on their territory they should make certain that these levels are observed by means of official checks, consisting, at least, of sampling;\nWhereas, in that case, the official checks should be made by using Community methods of sample-taking and Community methods of analysis;\nWhereas the fixing of methods of sampling and analysis is a technical and scientific implementing measure ; whereas in order to facilitate the adoption thereof, the rules relating to those samples and analyses should be laid down by means of a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Protection;\nWhereas any amendment to the Annexes should, in view of their basically technical nature, be made easier by an accelerated procedure,", "main_body": ["This Directive concerns products intended for human or, in exceptional cases, animal consumption listed under the Common Customs Tariff headings set out in Annex I and in or on which are found the pesticide residues listed in Annex II.", "1.
