The rules and procedures for obtaining a marketing authorisation are laid down in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use\u00a0(2) and in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n(2) In the case of certain categories of medicinal products, however, in order to meet unmet medical needs of patients and in the interests of public health, it may be necessary to grant marketing authorisations on the basis of less complete data than is normally the case and subject to specific obligations, hereinafter \u2018conditional marketing authorisations\u2019. The categories concerned should be medicinal products which aim at the treatment, prevention or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats recognised either by the World Health Organisation or by the Community in the framework of Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community\u00a0(3), or medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products\u00a0(4).\n(3) Although the data upon which an opinion on a conditional marketing authorisation is based may be less complete, the risk-benefit balance, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC should be positive. Furthermore, the benefits to public health of making the medicinal product concerned immediately available on the market should outweigh the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.\n(4) Where conditional marketing authorisations are granted, they should be restricted to situations where only the clinical part of the application dossier is less complete than normal. Incomplete pre-clinical or pharmaceutical data should be accepted only in the case of a product to be used in emergency situations, in response to public health threats.\n(5) In order to ensure that the right balance is struck between facilitating access to medicines for patients with unmet medical needs and preventing the authorisation of medicines with an unfavourable risk-benefit profile, it is necessary to make those marketing authorisations subject to specific obligations. The holder should be required to complete or initiate certain studies with a view to confirming that the risk-benefit balance is positive and resolving any questions relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.\n(6) Conditional marketing authorisations are distinct from marketing authorisations granted in exceptional circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In the case of the conditional marketing authorisation, authorisation is granted before all data are available. The authorisation is not intended, however, to remain conditional indefinitely. Rather, once the missing data are provided, it should be possible to replace it with a marketing authorisation which is not conditional, that is to say, which is not subject to specific obligations. In contrast, it will normally never be possible to assemble a full dossier in respect of a marketing authorisation granted in exceptional circumstances.\n(7) It should also be made clear that applications containing requests for conditional marketing authorisations may be the subject of an accelerated assessment procedure in accordance with Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n(8) Since the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 apply to conditional marketing authorisations unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, the procedure for evaluating a conditional marketing authorisation is the normal procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.\n(9) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, conditional marketing authorisations will be valid for one year on a renewable basis. The deadline for submission of a renewal application should be six months prior to the expiry of the marketing authorisation, and the opinion of the European Medicines Agency (hereinafter the Agency) on the application should be adopted within 90 days of its receipt. To ensure that medicinal products are not removed from the market except for reasons related to public health, the conditional marketing authorisation should, as long as a renewal application is submitted within the deadline, remain valid until the Commission reaches a decision based on the renewal assessment procedure.\n(10) Clear information should be provided to patients and healthcare professionals on the conditional nature of the authorisations. It is therefore necessary that such information be clearly stated in the summary of product characteristics of the medicinal product concerned as well as on the package leaflet.\n(11) Enhanced pharmacovigilance for medicinal products granted a conditional marketing authorisation is important and is already adequately provided for in Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. However, the time schedule for submitting periodic safety update reports should be adapted to accommodate the annual renewal of conditional marketing authorisations.\n(12) The planning of studies and of the submission of an application for a marketing authorisation occurs at an early stage in the development of medicinal products. Such planning will critically depend on whether a conditional marketing authorisation is a possibility. For this reason it is necessary to provide a mechanism for the Agency to give companies advice on whether a medicinal product falls within the scope of this Regulation. Such advice should be an additional service to the existing scientific advice provided by the Agency.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules on the granting of a marketing authorisation subject to specific obligations in accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, hereinafter \u2018conditional marketing authorisation\u2019.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to medicinal products for human use that fall under Article 3(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and belong to one of the following categories:\n1. medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases;\n2. medicinal products to be used in emergency situations, in response to public health threats duly recognised either by the World Health Organisation or by the Community in the framework of Decision No 2119/98/EC;\n3. medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.", "Requests or proposals\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A request for a conditional marketing authorisation may be presented by the applicant together with an application in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
