It therefore meets the conditions set out in Article 27 of the sixth VAT Directive.\n(7) The forms of tax evasion or avoidance in question consist mainly of the purchase of VAT-exempt investment gold which is then worked to make jewellery or other goods, with no VAT being paid on the value of the investment gold involved in the transaction.\n(8) The derogation will expire on 31 December 2004, so that an assessment can then be made as to whether it is appropriate in the light of changes in the application of the special system for investment gold established by Directive 98/80/EC(2).\n(9) The derogation will have no negative impact on the European Communities' own resources provided from value added tax,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Spain is authorised, by way of derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the sixth VAT Directive, to include in the taxable amount in respect of the supply of goods or services involving the working of non-taxed investment gold the value of the gold contained in the finished product based on the current market value of the investment gold.", "The authorisation granted under Article 1 shall expire on 31 December 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
