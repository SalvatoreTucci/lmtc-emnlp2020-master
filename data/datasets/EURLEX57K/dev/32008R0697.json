According to that function the TAC would amount to 470\u00a0000 tonnes.\n(4) In accordance with point 7 of Annex IID to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008, the TAC should not exceed 400\u00a0000 tonnes.\n(5) Point 5 of Annex IID to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 provides that for the unallocated quota for this TAC, the fishing effort allowed in the exploratory fishing relating to sandeel abundance in 2008 shall be distributed to Member States whose vessels have a record of fishing activity in the years 2002 to 2006 in that area, which corresponds to a share of fishing effort of 96\u00a0% for Sweden and a share of 4\u00a0% for Germany. The allocation key for the unallocated quota for this TAC should be established on the basis of that distribution of fishing effort.\n(6) Sandeel is a North Sea stock which is shared with Norway but which is currently not jointly managed. The measures provided for in this Regulation should be in accordance with consultations with Norway pursuant to the provisions of the Agreed Record of conclusions of fisheries consultations between the European Commission and Norway of 26 November 2007. In consequence, the Community share of that part of the TAC that can be caught in ICES zones IIa and IV should be fixed at 90\u00a0% of 400\u00a0000 tonnes.\n(7) Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 19, 23.1.2008, p. 1.
