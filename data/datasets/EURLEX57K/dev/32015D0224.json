Further amendments to those Statutes are required in order to improve the management and the governance of the Joint Undertaking. In order to take into account the amendments to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is also necessary to update the reference to the provisions on the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n(6) In accordance with the Statutes of the Joint Undertaking, the Governing Board of the Joint Undertaking approved the amendments to Decision 2007/198/Euratom proposed by the Commission.\n(7) An Administration and Management Committee should be established to prepare opinions and recommendations for the adoption of key documents by the Governing Board. That Committee should also provide advice or recommendations on specific administrative and financial issues upon request of the Director or of the Governing Board. The Governing Board should have the power to delegate tasks to that Committee. Any Member of the Joint Undertaking should have the right to nominate a representative to serve on that Committee.\n(8) A Procurement and Contracts Committee should be established to give recommendations to the Director of the Joint Undertaking on the award of contracts, grants and related matters. Members of that Committee should be nominated to serve in a personal capacity by the Governing Board.\n(9) A Bureau should be established to assist the Governing Board in the preparation of its decisions. The Governing Board should have the power to delegate tasks to the Bureau. The members of the Bureau should be the Chair of the Governing Board, the Chairs of the Governing Board Committees, a representative of Euratom and a representative of the ITER host State (France). The Governing Board should be entitled to appoint additional persons to the Bureau.\n(10) In accordance with Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission is to ensure the application of the Treaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them. Therefore, the rights of the Commission should be strengthened to ensure consistency of the decisions of the Governing Board with Community law.\n(11) It is desirable to consolidate designated organisations in the field of scientific and technological fusion research as a network to provide stable and long-term research and development support to the Joint Undertaking, based on the knowledge and know-how developed by the European Fusion programme and on those to be developed in the future.\n(12) It is necessary to take into account the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012\u00a0(4), in particular the role of the Commission's internal auditor as internal auditor of the Joint Undertaking.\n(13) Decision 2007/198/Euratom ensures the financing of the Joint Undertaking activities for 2014-20. Article\u00a012(1)(a) of the Statutes of the Joint Undertaking provides for the Euratom contribution to be made available through the Community research and training programmes adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. Article 12(1)(a) should be amended to take account of the fact that financing for 2014-20 will no longer be made available through the Euratom Framework Programme.\n(14) It is also appropriate to update Decision 2007/198/Euratom as regards the provisions on protection of the financial interests of the Members.\n(15) Decision 2007/198/Euratom should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/198/Euratom is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1 the following sentence is added:\n(b) paragraph 2 is deleted;\n(2) the following article is inserted:\n(3) Article 9(3) is replaced by the following:\n(4) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 February 2015.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
