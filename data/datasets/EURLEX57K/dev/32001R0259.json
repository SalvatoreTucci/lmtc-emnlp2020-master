Fisheries for these species within the closed area should, therefore, be permitted.\n(7) To confirm that fishing for pelagic fish and sandeels creates no peril for cod, observers should be placed on board vessels which fish for these species within the closed area.\n(8) To further ensure compliance with the required conditions for fishing by fishing vessels operating within or passing through the closed area, additional measures to control the activities of such fishing vessels are required,", "main_body": ["1.
