Seeds and skin are separated mechanically from the pureed fruits. After pasteurisation, the puree is packaged in aseptic containers and stored under cold conditions.\nMorinda citrifolia concentrate is prepared from M. citrifolia puree by treatment with pectinolytic enzymes (50-60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1-2\u00a0h). Then the puree is heated to inactivate the pectinases and then immediately cooled. The juice is separated in a decanter centrifuge. Afterwards the juice is collected and pasteurised, prior to being concentrated in a vacuum evaporator from a brix of 6 to 8 to a brix of 49 to 51 in the final concentrate.\nComposition of Morinda citrifolia fruit puree and concentrate\nMoisture 89 \u2013 93\u00a0% 48 \u2013 53\u00a0%\nProtein <\u00a00,6\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 3 \u2013 3,5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nFat <\u00a00,2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g <\u00a00,04\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nAsh <\u00a01\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 4,5 \u2013 5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nTotal carbohydrates 5 \u2013 10\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 37 \u2013 45\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nFructose 0,5 \u2013 2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 9 \u2013 11\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nGlucose 0,5 \u2013 2\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 9 \u2013 11\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nDietary fibre 1,5 \u2013 3\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 1,5 \u2013 5\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\n5,15-dimethylmorindol\u00a0(1) 0,19 \u2013 0,20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL 0,11 \u2013 0,77\u00a0\u03bcg/mL\nLucidin\u00a0(1) Not detectable Not detectable\nAlizarin\u00a0(1) Not detectable Not detectable\nRubiadin\u00a0(1) Not detectable Not detectable\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0By an HPLC-UV method developed and validated by the applicant for the analysis of anthraquinones in Morinda citrifolia puree and concentrate.\nLimits of detection: 2,5\u00a0ng/mL (5,15 dimethylmorindol); 50,0\u00a0ng/mL (lucidin); 6,3\u00a0ng/mL (alizarin) and 62,5\u00a0ng/mL (rubiadin).\nANNEX II\nUses of Morinda citrifolia fruit puree and concentrate\nUse group Maximum use level of Morinda citrifolia fruit\npuree concentrate\nCandy/Confectionery 45\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 10\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nCereal bars 53\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 12\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nPowdered nutritional drink mixes (dry weight) 53\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 12\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nCarbonated beverages 11\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 3\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nIce cream & sorbet 31\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 7\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nYogurt 12\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 3\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nBiscuits 53\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 12\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nBuns, cakes & pastries 53\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 12\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nBreakfast cereal (whole grain) 88\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 20\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nJams and jellies (fruit preserves) (1)\u00a0133\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 30\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nSweet spreads, fillings and icings 31\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 7\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nSavoury sauces, pickles, gravies, and condiments 88\u00a0g/100\u00a0g 20\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nFood supplements (in accordance with Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2)) 26\u00a0g per daily dose as recommended by the manufacturer 6\u00a0g per daily dose as recommended by the manufacturer\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Based on pre-processing quantity to produce final 100\u00a0g product.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0183, 12.7.2002, p.\u00a051."}
