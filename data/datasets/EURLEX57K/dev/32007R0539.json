As a result, detailed rules for the administration of those quotas should be laid down.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(4) should apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 593/2004 of 30 March 2004 opening and providing for the administration of the tariff quotas in the egg sector and for egg albumin\u00a0(5) must be substantially amended. Regulation (EC) No 593/2004 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, the quota period from 1 July to 30 June of the following year should be subdivided into a number of subperiods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(5) The administration of the tariff quotas should be based on import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.\n(6) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg sector and for egg albumin, clear conditions should be laid down as regards access for operators to the tariff quota scheme.\n(7) In order to ensure proper administration of the tariff quotas, the security for import licences should be set at EUR\u00a020 per 100\u00a0kilograms.\n(8) In the interest of the operators, the Commission should establish the quantities that have not been applied for, which are to be carried over to the following subperiod in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quotas in Annex I are hereby opened for the import of products in the egg sector and for egg albumin under the CN codes indicated therein.\nThe tariff quotas shall be open on an annual basis for the period from 1 July to 30 June the following year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quotas referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable rate of customs duty, the order numbers and the group numbers shall be as set out in Annex I.", "Regulations (EC) No 1291/2000 and (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply, save where this Regulation provides otherwise.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity set for the annual tariff quota period for the group number E1 shall be subdivided into four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 20\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) 30\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) 30\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) 20\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity set for the annual tariff quota period for the group numbers E2 and E3 shall be subdivided into four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, weight shall be converted into shell egg equivalent according to the standard rates of yield fixed in Annex 69 to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93\u00a0(6).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, import licence applicants shall, when submitting their first application for a given quota period, furnish proof that they imported or exported, during each of the two periods referred to in that Article, at least 50 tonnes of products (shell egg equivalent) covered by Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and Regulation (EEC) No 2783/75 or that they are accredited for the treatment of egg products in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications may refer to only one of the order numbers indicated in Annex I to this Regulation.
