whereas that price must be aligned with the level of the common prices pursuant to Article 59 of the said Act;\nWhereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the minimum price to be paid to producers, the non-member country price and, if necessary, the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis; whereas the volume of imports makes the non-member country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price;\nWhereas, as regards Greece, the said Article 103 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/84 (5) lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid;\nWhereas the minimum price to be paid to producers in Spain and Portugal and the production aid for the products obtained are to be determined as provided for in Articles 118 and 304 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas the representative period for determining the minimum price is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 461/86 of 25 February 1986 laying down, on account of the accesson of Spain and Portugal, rules on the production aid system in respect of processed fruit and vegetables (6); whereas the application of these provisions leads to the result that the minimum price and the aid to be fixed for Portugal are the same as those to be fixed for the other Member States, other than Spain;\nWhereas Article 118 (6) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal provides that during the first four marketing years following accession, the grant of production aid in Spain for peaches in syrup is to be limited to a quantity of 80 000 tonnes, expressed in net weight; whereas to ensure equitable allocation of raw material to each of the production regions of the Community, it should be laid down that peaches grown in a specific region only attract production aid when processed in that region;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 1986/87 marketing year:\n(a) the minimum price referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 to be paid to producers for peaches, and\n(b) the production aid referred to in Article 5 of the same Regulation for peaches in syrup,\nshall be as set out in the Annex.", "Where processing takes place outside the Member State in which the produce was grown, such Member State shall furnish proof to the Member State paying the production aid that the minimum price payable to the producer has been paid.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 1986.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 49, 27. 2. 1986, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 159, 14. 6. 1986, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 123, 9. 5. 1984, p. 25.\n(4) OJ No L 3, 1. 1. 1981, p. 12.\n(5) OJ No L 103, 16. 4. 1984, p. 21.\n(6) OJ No L 53, 1. 3. 1986, p. 15.\nANNEX\nMINIMUM PRICE TO BE PAID TO THE PRODUCERS\n1.2,4 //  //  // Product  // ECU/100 kg net ex producer for products grown in:  //  // 1.2.3.4 //  // Spain   // Greece  // Other Member States   //    //   //   //   // Peaches intended for the manufacture of peaches in syrup   // 26,725  // 29,714   // 31,284   //    //   //   //\nPRODUCTION AID\n1.2,4 //  //  // Product  // ECU/100 kg net ex products obtained from raw materials grown in:  //  // 1.2.3.4 //  // Spain (1)   // Greece (2)   // Other Member States (2)   //    //   //   //   // Peaches in syrup  // 10,553   // 9,482   // 14,625   //    //   //   //\n(1) The amount shown in this column is applicable only when the products are processed in Spain.
