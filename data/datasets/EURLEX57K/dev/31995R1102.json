whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\nWhereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\nWhereas tilmicosin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas based on the current use in veterinary practice romifidine, detomidine, human chorion gonadotrophin, brotizolam, calcium hypophosphite, calcium acetate, calcium propionate, calcium benzoate, calcium malate, calcium chloride, calcium sulphate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium phosphate, calcium polyphos-phates, calcium silicate, calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and calcium stearate should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas human chorion gonadotrophin, calcium hypo-phosphite, calcium acetate, calcium propionate, calcium benzoate, calcium malate, calcium chloride, calcium sulphate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium phosphate, calcium polyphosphates, calcium silicate, calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate and calcium stearate should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90: by extrapolation of scientific data this classification into Annex II shall apply to all food-producing animals;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, netobimin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Veterinary Medicinal Products Sector,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the sixtieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 1995.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 323, 16. 12. 1994, p. 15.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nA.
