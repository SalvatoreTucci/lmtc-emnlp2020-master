In Article 4d, the following subparagraph shall be added to paragraph 7:\n'The preceding subparagraph shall be extended to holdings situated throughout the territory of a Member State if in the Member State concerned the cattle population has a high proportion of suckler cows, representing at least 30 % of the total number of  cows, and if at least 30 % of male bovine animals slaughtered belong to conformation classes S and E. Any overshoot of these percentages is established on the basis of the average of the two years preceding that for which the premium is granted.'\n2. In Article 4d, paragraph 7a shall be deleted.\n3. In Article 4g, the following paragraph shall be added:\n'4a. Member States may apply appropriate environmental measures which correspond to the specific situation of the land used for the production of male bovine animals or suckler cows qualifying for premiums. Member States which avail themselves of this  possibility shall decide the penalties which are appropriate and proportional to the seriousness of the ecological consequences of not observing the said measures. These penalties may provide for a reduction or, where appropriate, cancellation of the  benefits accruing from the premium schemes. Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to apply this provision.'\n4. In Article 13 (4) (a), '220 kilograms' shall be replaced by '160 kilograms'.\n5.
