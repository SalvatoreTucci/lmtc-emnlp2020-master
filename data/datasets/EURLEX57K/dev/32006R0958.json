With the above countries due to join the European Union, this difference may result in speculative trade movements.\n(4) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans.\n(5) In view of the specific nature of the operation, appropriate provisions should be laid down with regard to export licences issued in connection with the standing invitation to tender, in particular as regards the deadline for the issue of the licences, their period of validity, the amount of the security and the quantity for which the obligation to export resulting from the licence is met. However, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(2) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 120/89 of 19 January 1989 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products\u00a0(3) must continue to apply.\n(6) The provisions of this Regulation replace, as regards the partial invitations to tender in July 2006, those of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1138/2005 of 15 July 2005 on a standing invitation to tender to determine levies and/or refunds on exports of white sugar for the 2005/06 marketing year\u00a0(4). For the sake of transparency and legal clarity, therefore, that Regulation should be repealed with effect from 1 July 2006.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A standing invitation to tender shall be opened in order to determine export refunds on white sugar covered by CN code 1701\u00a099\u00a010 for all destinations excluding Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro\u00a0(5), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and for Romania.
