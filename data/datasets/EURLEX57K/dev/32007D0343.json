In that report it came to the conclusion that the oil enriched with phytosterols is safe for human consumption.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 29 May 2006.\n(4) Within the sixty day-period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) The objections raised concerned issues of risk management rather than risk assessment issues, therefore there was no need to consult the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n(6) The authorisation of oil enriched with phytosterols/phytostanols should only cover use in foods where the addition of phytosterols/phytostanols is authorised. The rules concerning the presentation and the labelling of foods with added phytosterols/phytostanols apply.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 608/2004 of 31 March 2004\u00a0(2) concerning the labelling of foods and food ingredients with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols and/or phytostanol esters ensures that consumers receive the information necessary in order to avoid excessive intake of added phytosterols/phytostanols.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Oil enriched with phytosterols/phytostanols as specified in Annex 1 may be placed on the market in the Community as\u00a0a novel food ingredient for use in the foods specified in Annex\u00a02.", "The products containing the novel food ingredient shall be presented in such a manner that they can be easily divided into portions that contain either a maximum of 3\u00a0g (in case of one portion per day) or a maximum of 1\u00a0g (in case of three portions per day) of added phytosterols/phytostanols.\nThe amount of phytosterols/phytostanols added to a container of beverages shall not exceed 3\u00a0g.\nSpicy sauces and salad dressings including mayonnaise shall be packed as single portions.", "This Decision is addressed to Enzymotec, 5 Hataasi ST, Ramat Gabriel Industrial Park, Migdal HaEmeq, Israel 23 106."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 May 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.
