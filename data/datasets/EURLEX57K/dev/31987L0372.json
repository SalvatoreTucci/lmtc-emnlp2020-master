Member States shall ensure that the 905-914 and 950-959 MHz frequency bands or equivalent parts of the bands mentioned in paragraph 2 are reserved exclusively (1) for a public pan-European cellular digital mobile communications service by 1 January 1991.\n2. Member States shall ensure that the necessary plans are prepared for the public pan-European cellular digital mobile communications service to be able to occupy the whole of the 890-915 and 935-960 Mhz bands according to commerical demand as quickly as possible.", "The Commission shall report to the Council on the implementation of the Directive not later than the end of 1996.", "For the purposes of this Directive, a public pan-European cellular digital land-based mobile communications service shall mean a public cellular radio service provided in each of the Member States to a common specification, which includes the feature that all voice signals are encoded into binary digits prior to radio transmission, and where users provided with a service in one Member State can also gain access to the service in any other Member State.", "1.
