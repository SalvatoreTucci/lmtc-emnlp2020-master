A list of approved rapid tests for use in the surveillance programme for small ruminants is to be established on the basis of the opinion to be published. Accordingly, the currently approved rapid tests should be used for detecting TSE in small ruminants, until the publication of that opinion.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 February 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.

The producer must provide the test protocol to the Community reference laboratory.\nModifications to rapid tests or to test protocols may only be made following advance notification to the Community reference laboratory, and provided that the Community reference laboratory finds that the modification does not reduce the sensitivity, specificity or reliability of the rapid test. That finding shall be communicated to the Commission and to the national reference laboratories.\u2019"}
