Current knowledge suggests that the risk to public health in relation to this subtype is inferior to the risk of the strain circulating in Asia, which is an H5N1 virus subtype.\n(5) However, in view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, it is appropriate as an immediate measure to suspend imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds and hatching eggs of these species from the United States of America.\n(6) In accordance with Commission Decision 2000/666/EC(4) importation of birds other than poultry is authorised from all member countries of the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) subject to animal health guarantees provided by the country of origin, and to strict post-import quarantine measures in the Member States.\n(7) However, the importation of birds other than poultry, and also of pet birds accompanying their owners into the Community from the United States of America should be suspended as an additional measure in order to exclude any possible risk for disease occurrence in quarantine stations under the authority of the Member States.\n(8) Furthermore, the importation into the Community from the United States of America should be suspended for fresh meat of poultry, ratites, wild and farmed feathered game, meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of, those species, obtained from birds slaughtered after 27 January 2004, and for eggs for human consumption.\n(9) Commission Decision 97/222/EC(5) lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products, and establishes treatment regimes in order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products. The treatment that must be applied to the product depends on the health status of the country of origin, in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; in order to avoid an unnecessary burden on trade, imports of poultrymeat products originating in the United States of America treated to a temperature of at least 70 \u00b0Celsius throughout the product should continue to be authorised.\n(10) Sanitary control measures applicable to such products allow the exclusion from the scope of this Decision of channelled imports of raw material for the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs and pharmaceutical or technical products.\n(11) The United States of America have signed an Agreement with the European Community on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal products(6).\n(12) As soon as the United States of America has communicated further information on the disease situation and the control measures taken in this respect the measures taken on Community level in relation to this outbreak should be reviewed.\n(13) The revision of the Decision should take into account the regionalisation measures proposed by the veterinary authorities of the United States of America in accordance with the provisions in the Veterinary Agreement.\n(14) The provisions of this Decision will be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 2 and 3 March 2004,", "main_body": ["Member States shall suspend the importation from the territory of the United States of:\n- live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs of these species,\n- birds other than poultry, including pet birds accompanying their owners,\n- eggs for human consumption.", "Member States shall suspend the importation from the territory of the United States of:\n- fresh meat of poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game,\n- meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of, those species.", "1.
