Lindh\nDraft Letter to the President of the Republic of the Fiji Islands\nBrussels, ...\nH.E. Mr Ratu Josefa ILOILO\nPresident of the Republic of the Fiji Islands\nGovernment House SUVA / FIJI\nSir,\nThe European Union attaches the utmost importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nThus, the European Union condemned the 19 May 2000 coup and has expressed its deep concern at the ensuing political events in Fiji, deploring the deposing of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the taking hostage and the unconstitutional replacement of the democratically elected government, and the repeal of the 1997 Constitution.\nThe Council of the European Union therefore decided, on 4 August 2000, to invite the authorities of Fiji to hold consultations, with a view to assessing the situation in detail and remedying it.\nThese consultations took place in Brussels on 19 October 2000. A number of key issues were addressed, and the Fijian authorities, represented by Mr. Kaliopate Tavola, Minister of Foreign Affairs, External Trade and Sugar, of the Interim Government of Fiji, presented their point of view and made a series of commitments concerning a timetable for constitutional revision, the holding of free, democratic elections within 18 months and the bringing to justice of those responsible for the coup.\nSubsequently, events in Fiji have taken a generally more positive course than the scenario apparent in October 2000.\nThe European Union welcomes the judgment of the Court of Appeal on 1 March 2001, stating that the 1997 Constitution remains the supreme law of Fiji.\nThe European Union welcomes the announcement that elections, under the 1997 Constitution, will be held from 25 August to 1 September 2001. These elections, if held in a free and fair manner, should lay the foundations for a full restoration of democracy in Fiji within a specified period of time.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union has decided to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. The Union has decided to take the following appropriate measures, within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of the Agreement:\n- the notification of the 9th EDF allocation will be made once free and fair elections have taken place and a legitimate Government has assumed office,\n- financing and implementation of new programmes and projects under the 6th, 7th and 8th EDF National Indicative Programmes will go ahead once free and fair elections have taken place and a legitimate Government has assumed office.\nOngoing projects will be implemented as planned, with due regard for the principle of neutrality of Community aid during the run-up to the elections.\nIn addition, contributions to regional projects, operations of a humanitarian nature, trade cooperation and trade related preferences will continue unaffected in order to ensure that the economic interests of the ordinary people of Fiji are not harmed.\nThe Union is also willing to support Fiji in its return to democracy.\nOnce free and fair elections have taken place and a legitimate Government has assumed office, in conditions which ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, the above measures will be revoked. In any case, the Union will review this decision within six months.\nThe European Union will continue to monitor events in Fiji, particularly with respect to the maintenance of law and order, the election campaign, the formation of a legitimate Government, and the bringing to trial of Mr George Speight and his associates.\nThe European Union would once again like to emphasise its desire to pursue the political dialogue with Fiji, on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\n...\nFor the Council\n..."}
