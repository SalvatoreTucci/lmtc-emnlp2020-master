The relative percentage of each must therefore be estimated by an objective assessment of the colour, and the weight is calculated on the assumption that their density is identical.' is replaced by:\n'It is extremely difficult to separate the waste and the lupulin precisely. However, it is possible, using a sieve with a mesh size of 0,8 millimetres, to determine approximately the relative proportions of the waste and the lupulin.\nWhen estimating the proportion of lupulin, it should be taken into account that the density of the lupulin is four times greater than that of the waste.';\n2. in point (d) of Annex IV, 'and on each packet or box of powder or extract in the sealed package' is added after 'printing on the sealed package'.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 1989 hops harvest.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 April 1989.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 175, 4. 8. 1971, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 377, 31. 12. 1987, p. 40.\n(3) OJ No L 117, 29. 4. 1978, p. 43.\n(4) OJ No L 354, 22. 12. 1988, p. 24."}
