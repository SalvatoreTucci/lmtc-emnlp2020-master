For active substances for which a notifier fails to fulfil its obligations under the Regulation no completeness check or evaluation of the dossier shall be performed. For mefluidide the notifier has not submitted by 23 May 2003 the necessary data lists. Therefore this active substance should not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and Member States should withdraw all authorizations for plant protection products containing mefluidide.\n(3) For the active substances for which there is only a short period of advance notice for the withdrawal of plant protection products containing such substances, it is reasonable to provide for a period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks for a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing. In cases where a longer advance notice period is provided, such period can be shortened to expire at the end of the growing season.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Mefluidide shall not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that:\n1.
