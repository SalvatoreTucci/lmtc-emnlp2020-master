In addition, Directive 2009/48/EC empowers the Commission to adopt specific limit values for chemicals used in toys which are intended for children under 36\u00a0months and in other toys intended to be placed in the mouth in order to ensure adequate protection in the case of toys involving a high degree of exposure. The adoption of such limit values takes the form of an inclusion in Appendix C to Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC.\n(2) For a number of chemicals, currently applicable limit values are either too high in the light of available scientific evidence or do not exist. Specific limit values should therefore be adopted for them, taking into account the packaging requirements for food as well as the differences between toys and food contact materials.\n(3) In order to advise the European Commission in the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives in the area of toy safety, the Commission established the Expert Group on Toys Safety. The mission of its subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 is to provide such advice with regard to chemical substances which may be used in toys.\n(4) 5-Chloro-2-methylisothiazolin-3(2H)-one (CMI) and 2-methylisothiazolin-3(2H)-one (MI) in a ratio of 3:1 (CAS number 55965-84-9)\u00a0(3) as well as its individual components CMI (CAS number 26172-55-4) and MI (CAS\u00a0number 2682-20-4) are used as preservatives in water-based toys\u00a0(4) including hobby paints, finger paints, window/glass paints, glues and soap bubbles\u00a0(5).\n(5) In its deliberations about CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1 as well as the individual components CMI and MI the subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 took as a basis the related opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) noting that neither CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1 nor the individual components CMI or MI are recommended for use in toys, due to contact allergic reactions observed with these substances in cosmetics\u00a0(6). The subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 also took account of the related SCCS opinion which considers CMI and\u00a0MI in a ratio of 3:1 an extreme contact allergen in humans as demonstrated by available data\u00a0(7).\n(6) CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1 is classified under Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008 as a skin sensitiser; CMI and MI individually are not classified under the Regulation. Directive 2009/48/EC has currently no specific limit value for CMI/MI 3:1, nor for CMI or MI individually, nor a general limit value for sensitisers.\n(7) In the light of the above the subgroup \u2018Chemicals\u2019 recommended at its meeting of 15\u00a0February 2012 that CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1 should not be used in toys.\n(8) According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR, Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung)\u00a0(8) limit values for CMI and MI, which are strongly allergenic, should be set at a concentration considered protective for individuals who are already sensitised. This is the strictest way to limit allergens, since already sensitised individuals suffer from an allergy outbreak at even lowest allergen concentrations. According to the abovementioned SCCS opinion such concentration is below 2\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0(9).\n(9) According to the BfR, market surveillance is able to routinely quantify CMI down to 0,75\u00a0mg/kg and MI down to 0,25\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0(10) (limits of quantification, LOQs).\n(10) In the light of the above, the Expert Group on Toys Safety recommended at its meeting of 23\u00a0May 2014 to also limit the uses of CMI and MI individually to their LOQs.\n(11) While there is a specific migration limit for MI individually as an additive for use in certain food contact materials, the basic assumptions for deriving that migration limit are different from those for the content limit for MI in toys. The uses of CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1 and of CMI individually are not regulated for food contact materials.\n(12) In view of the above, Appendix C of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC should be amended to include content limits for CMI and MI in a ratio of 3:1, as well as for CMI and MI individually, in toys.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 47 of Directive 2009/48/EC,", "main_body": ["In Appendix C of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC, the following entries shall be added:\nSubstance CAS No Limit value\n\u2018reaction mass of: 5-chloro-2- methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one [EC no. 247-500-7] and 2-methyl-2H -isothiazol-3-one [EC no. 220-239-6] (3:1) 55965-84-9 1\u00a0mg/kg (content limit) in aqueous toy materials\n5-Chloro-2-methyl-isothiazolin-3(2H)-one 26172-55-4 0,75\u00a0mg/kg (content limit) in aqueous toy materials\n2-methylisothiazolin-3(2H)-one 2682-20-4 0,25\u00a0mg/kg (content limit) in aqueous toy materials\u2019", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 24\u00a0November 2017 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
