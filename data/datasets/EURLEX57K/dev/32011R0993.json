These lists included 8-hydroxyquinoline.\n(3) For 8-hydroxyquinoline no complete dossier was submitted within the prescribed time limit. Consequently, Commission Decision 2006/797/EC of 22 November 2006 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances\u00a0(6) was adopted on the non-inclusion of 8-hydroxyquinoline.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter \u2018the applicant\u2019) submitted a new application requesting the regular procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 3 to 12 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n(5) The application was submitted to Spain, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. That application complies with the substantive and procedural requirements of Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n(6) Spain evaluated the information submitted and prepared a draft assessment report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) and to the Commission on 3 August 2009. The Authority communicated the draft assessment report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the draft assessment report available to the public. In accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on the risk assessment of 8-hydroxyquinoline to the Commission on 17 December 2010\u00a0(7). The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 15 July 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for 8-hydroxyquinoline.\n(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 8-hydroxyquinoline may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve 8-hydroxyquinoline in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.\n(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that 8-hydroxyquinoline should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances\u00a0(8) should be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Approval of active substance\nThe active substance 8-hydroxyquinoline, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "Entry into force and date of application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0309, 24.11.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a015, 18.1.2008, p.\u00a05.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a055, 29.2.2000, p.\u00a025.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 21.8.2002, p.\u00a023.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0324, 23.11.2006, p.\u00a08.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 8-hydroxyquinoline.
