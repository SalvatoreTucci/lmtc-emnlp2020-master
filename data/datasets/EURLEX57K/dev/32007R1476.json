Given the continued existence of intervention stocks, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to sell for industrial use sugar held by the intervention agencies.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.\n(3) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(4) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(5) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States to the Commission on the quantities actually sold.\n(6) The provisions on processor's records, checks and penalties laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota\u00a0(3) should apply to the quantities awarded under this Regulation.\n(7) To ensure that the quantities awarded pursuant to this Regulation are used as industrial sugar, financial penalties must be laid down for tenderers at a dissuasive level to avoid any risk of these quantities being used for other purposes.\n(8) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001\u00a0(4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar pursuant to this Regulation.\n(9) The quantities available for a Member State that can be awarded pursuant to this Regulation should take into account the quantities awarded pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1059/2007 of 14 September 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, and Sweden\u00a0(5).\n(10) The quantities awarded under this Regulation should also be taken into account for the quantities that can be awarded under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1060/2007 of 14 September 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale for export of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden\u00a0(6). A relevant provision should therefore be inserted in Regulation (EC) No 1060/2007.\n(11) The maximum quantities of intervention sugar held by the Spanish intervention agency according to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1059/2007 and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2007 did not take into account 18\u00a0000 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention in April 2006.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 1059/2007 and (EC) No 1060/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender for industrial use a maximum total quantity of 477\u00a0924 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale for industrial use.\nThe maximum quantities involved per Member State are set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 1 January 2008 and shall end on 9 January 2008 at 15.00, Brussels time.\nThe periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period.
