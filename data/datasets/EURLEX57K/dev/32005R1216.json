These difficulties concern, in particular, the date from which the procedure in question is to commence. Applying the various provisions regarding the grant of the derogation imposes a serious and complex administrative burden, particularly as regards checks and penalties.\n(2) To overcome these difficulties, the provisions on the regularisation of illegal plantation need to be amended. Pending the submission of an appropriate proposal to the Council and in the interests of sound administration, the date for the closure of the procedure laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000\u00a0(2) should therefore be postponed definitively to 31 December 2007.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u20181a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The deadline laid down in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall be postponed to 31 December 2007.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
