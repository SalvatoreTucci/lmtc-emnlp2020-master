Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of sodium cyclamate originating in the PRC, limited to the Fang Da group should be terminated.\n(10) The review based on Article 2(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001\u00a0(3) can therefore also be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of sodium cyclamate originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, limited to two Chinese exporting producers Fang Da Food Additive (Shen Zhen) Limited and Fang Da Food Additive (Yang Quan) Limited, is hereby terminated.", "The review based on Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 50, 17.2.2011, p. 9.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 201, 26.7.2001, p. 10."}
