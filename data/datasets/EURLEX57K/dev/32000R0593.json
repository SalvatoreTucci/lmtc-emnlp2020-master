Those arrangements were extended beyond 1 January 1994 by an agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters with the Kingdom of Morocco for the duration of the Cooperation Agreement.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 2006/97 establishes certain rules for the application of the arrangements with the aim of adapting them to the requirements of the Agreement on agriculture concluded as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.\n(3) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2006/97 states that where a new agreement is concluded the Commission shall adopt the resultant adjustments in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats [3], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 [4].
