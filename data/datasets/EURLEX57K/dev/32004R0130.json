However, to relieve the market rapidly and allow the market price level to improve, operators should be encouraged to undertake exports more rapidly by means of refunds. A shorter period of validity for export licences issued under this measure should therefore be set.\n(3) Given the increase in refunds compared with previous situations, the amount of the securities set in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1518/2003 should be adjusted.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1518/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1518/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) in Article 2(1) the following subparagraph is added:\"However, for products falling within CN code 0203, export licences issued in February 2004 shall be valid only until the end of the second month following that of their issue and those issued in March 2004 shall be valid only until the end of the month following that of their issue.\"\n(b) Annex I is replaced by the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to export licences applied for from 27 January 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 January 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 1.
