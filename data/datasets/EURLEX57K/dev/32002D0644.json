As regards Illex squid, the United Kingdom indicates that not all specific fishing expertise required is currently available from crew from the OCT, the Community or the ACP States. The lack of crew from the OCT, the Community or the ACP States, stems in particular from the specific geographical situation of the Falkland Islands and cannot be remedied by increasing the presence of Community fishing fleets in the Falkland area.\n(4) As regards frozen fish and frozen fish fillets, the requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC and, specifically, under Article 37(1) thereof, and would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry, provided that the relevant fish species are clearly specified, that at least 25 % of the crew are OCT, Member State or ACP nationals, and that certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration are respected.\n(5) As regards Loligo squid, the requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC and, specifically, under Article 37(1) thereof, and, limited in quantities, would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry, provided that at least 25 % of the crew are OCT, Member State or ACP nationals. However, certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration should be respected.\n(6) As regards frozen Illex squid, the requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC and, specifically, under Article 37(1) thereof, and should allow the Falkland Islands to build up progressively the capacity and specific expertise required for this type of fishing. The derogation, limited in quantities, would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry, provided that certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration were respected.\n(7) Granting a derogation would also contribute to support and possibly deepen the long-standing cooperation and joint ventures between Falkland and Community companies, with a positive effect on economic activities and employment in both regions.\n(8) A derogation should be granted with due regard to specific problems, which the Falkland Islands are facing at this juncture, so as to enable the Falkland Islands to satisfy as far as possible all rules of origin laid down in Article 3(2) of Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC by stages.\n(9) The current legal framework of the Falkland Islands maritime registry and its monitoring by the concerned authorities prevent the risk of unfair competition practices associated with flags of convenience which might cause a prejudice to a Community industry.\n(10) The derogation should not prejudice any measures adopted at international level for the management and conservation of certain fish stocks.\n(11) Accordingly, a derogation should be granted to the Falkland Islands in respect of certain fishery products and for limited quantities for the period from 1 September 2002 to 31 August 2007.\n(12) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(3), lays down rules for the management of tariff quotas. Those rules should be applied mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities in respect of which the derogation in question is granted.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
