Decision 2004/858/EC provides for the PHEA to carry out its functions until 31 December 2010 in order to execute contracts and grants signed under the Public Health Programme 2003-2008.\n(2) Decision No 1350/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008 to 2013)\u00a0(4) (hereinafter referred to as the second Public Health Programme 2008-2013) entered into force on 21 November 2007. The second Public Health Programme is designed to continue Community action in the field of public health by focusing along three broad objectives: to improve citizens\u2019 health security; to promote health to improve prosperity and solidarity; and to generate and disseminate health knowledge.\n(3) The programme of Community action in the field of Consumer policy for 2007-2013, adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 18 December 2006\u00a0(5) (hereinafter referred to as the Consumer programme for 2007-2013), establishes the general framework for financing Community actions in support of Consumer policy for the years 2007 to 2013. The aim of the Programme is to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting the health, safety and economic and legal interests of consumers as well as to promoting their rights to information, to education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests.\n(4) Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\u00a0(6) allows the Commission to organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States and for participants from third countries, including developing countries. The areas covered by such training are food law and feed law, animal health and animal welfare requirements. In addition, Article 2(1)(i) of Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community\u00a0(7), offers a legal basis for training in the plant health sector so that the training activities organised by the Commission constitute an overall Community training strategy in the areas of food law, feed law, animal health and animal welfare rules, as well as plant health rules (hereinafter referred to as the food safety training measures covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and Directive 2000/29/EC).\n(5) A cost-benefit analysis carried out by external consultants has shown that continuing to entrust programme implementation tasks related to the second Public Health Programme 2008-2013 to the existing PHEA would be the most cost-effective option.\n(6) Cost-benefit analysis also showed that programme implementation tasks related to the Consumer programme for 2007-2013 as well as to the food safety training measures covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and Directive 2000/29/EC could be carried out more efficiently by the existing PHEA, whilst ensuring the overall management by the Commission of those Community programmes and measures.\n(7) In order to reflect its additional tasks, the PHEA should be transformed into the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers.\n(8) Decision 2004/858/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The provisions set out by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/858/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
