Imports under those quotas are exempt from the customs duties fixed in the Common Customs Tariff (CCT). The detailed rules for applying those quotas on a multiannual basis should be adopted for periods of 12 months starting on 1 July, hereinafter known as \"import years\".\n(2) To ensure orderly imports, the quantities should be staggered over different periods.\n(3) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in these arrangements for beef and veal, precise conditions should be laid down for access by operators. Verification of those conditions requires that applications should be submitted in the Member State in which the importer is listed in the VAT register.\n(4) To ensure that all eligible operators have the fairest possible access to the arrangements, the number of applications per interested party should be restricted for each group of products for each Baltic country, and a maximum quantity which each import licence application may cover should be fixed.\n(5) For a licence application per group of products, a minimum quantity should also be fixed so that the import of that quantity can be regarded as real and reliable.\n(6) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied.\n(7) Bearing in mind the provisions of the agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the products, provision should be made for these arrangements to be managed using import licences. To that end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and on the information to be given on applications and licences, where appropriate, by derogating from or supplementing Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 954/2002(7), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2492/2001(9).\n(8) To avoid speculation, import licences should not be transferable.\n(9) The measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
