Decision 2006/415/EC lays down certain protection measures to be applied in case of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in a Member State, including the establishment of areas A and B following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of that disease. In addition, Decision 2007/25/EC concerns certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza and movements of pet birds accompanying their owners into the Union.\n(3) The measures laid down in those Decisions apply until 31 December 2013. However, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in wild birds and in poultry continue to occur in third countries thereby also posing a risk to animal and human health in the Union.\n(4) Given the epidemiological situation regarding highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype, it is appropriate to continue mitigating the risks posed by that infection by maintaining biosecurity measures, early detection systems and certain protection measures in relation to outbreaks in poultry and the movement of pet birds from third countries to the Union.\n(5) In addition, an external evaluation\u00a0(8) of the Union\u2019s emergency response network during 2012 has demonstrated that protection measures in relation to outbreaks of avian influenza including those laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC adopted at Union level are considered relevant and effective by Member States.\n(6) The period of application of Decisions 2005/734/EC, 2006/415/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be extended until 31 December 2015.\n(7) Decisions 2005/734/EC, 2006/415/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 4 of Decision 2005/734/EC, the date \u201831 December 2013\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2015\u2019.", "In Article 12 of Decision 2006/415/EC, the date \u201831 December 2013\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2015\u2019.", "In Article 6 of Decision 2007/25/EC, the date \u201831 December 2013\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2015\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 10, 14.1.2006, p. 16.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk (OJ L 274, 20.10.2005, p. 105).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC (OJ L 164, 16.6.2006, p. 51).\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2007/25/EC of 22 December 2006 as regards certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza and movements of pet birds accompanying their owners into the Community (OJ L 8, 13.1.2007, p. 29).\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/strategy/pillars/docs/23_final_report_eu_rapid_response.pdf"}
