In addition, Member States are to conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism or evidence of infection by the specified organism on plants of specific Palmae species in their territory.\n(2) The official annual surveys carried out in 2007 by the Member States show that the specified organism also infected plants of Palmae species which are not defined as susceptible plants in Decision 2007/365/EC. It is appropriate that the emergency measures provided for in Decision 2007/365/EC apply also to those plants.\n(3) The results of the emergency measures laid down in Decision 2007/365/EC were assessed by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in April 2008.
