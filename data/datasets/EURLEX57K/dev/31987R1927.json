 whereas, in accordance with Article 1 (3) of the above Regulation, the marketing years for the products in question are as follows:  - for cauliflowers, from 1 May to 30 April,- for tomatoes, from 1 January to 31 December,- for peaches, from 1 May to 31  October,- for lemons, from 1 June to 31 May,- for pears, from 1 June to 31 May,- for table grapes, from 1 May to 30 April,- for apples, from 1 July to 30 June,- for mandarins, from 1 October to 15 May,- for oranges, from 1 October to 15 July,- for  aubergines, from 1 January to 31 December,- for apricots, from 1 May to 31 August; Whereas, however, pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, no basic price or buying-in price need be fixed for the slack  marketing periods at the beginning and at the end of the marketing year; Whereas, when the basic prices and buying-in prices for fruit and vegetables are fixed, account should be taken of the aims of the common agricultural policy and the contribution  which the Community desires to make to the harmonious development of world trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure the availability  of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices; Whereas the basic prices must be fixed by reference to the trend in the average prices recorded during the three preceding years on the most representative producer markets  within the Community for a product with defined commercial characteristics, such as a variety or type, quality class, size and packaging; whereas the buying-in prices must be fixed by reference to the basic price in accordance with Article 16 (3) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; Whereas provision should be made that the fixed prices apply as from 1 July 1987; whereas in fact, pending the Council's decision, the Commission has been moved to take by means of Regulations (EEC) No 1213/87 (8) and (EEC)  No 1503/87 (9) interim protective measures to ensure the continuity of the intervention arrangements for products for which the period of application of basic prices and buying-in prices begin either in May or June;       Whereas, as regards Greece, in  accordance with Article 74 of the Act of Accession, moves towards the final alignment of basic prices and buying-in prices applicable in that Member State should be made in accordance with Article 59 (2) (a), (3) (a) and (b) of that Act; Whereas the  Kingdom of Spain, during the first phase, and the Portuguese Republic, during the first stage, are authorized to maintain, with respect to fruit and vegetables, the national arrangements previously in force for the organization of their domestic  agricultural markets, subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 133 to 135 and 262 to 265, respectively, of the Act of Accession; whereas the prices and amounts fixed by this Regulation are therefore applicable only in the Community of Ten;  Whereas the amount of the financial compensation for oranges and mandarins must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69,", "main_body": ["For the 1987/88 marketing year, the basic prices and the buying-in prices for fruit and vegetables, the periods during which they apply and the standard qualities to which they relate shall be as set out in Annex I.", "For the 1987/88 marketing year, the financial compensation for oranges and mandarins shall be as set out in Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
