(2) OJ No C 95, 25.4.1981, p. 2.  the Treaty ; whereas the French Government further points out that the measures in question have effects equivalent to those of fiscal measures introduced in other Member States to avoid similar distortions, such as the flat-rate refund of VAT at rates considerably exceeding the French rates;\nWhereas several Member States and other parties concerned have submitted their observations to the Commission and all feel that the French measure distorts competition and affects trade between the Member States to an extent contrary to the common interest and that it therefore should not be eligible for one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3);\nIII\nWhereas the aid for maintaining farm incomes is paid on the basis of receipts from sales of the products concerned ; whereas, therefore, it infringes the provisions of the respective common market organizations ; whereas Article 24 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products forbids \"aid whose amount is determined on the basis of the price or quantity of products\" covered by that Regulation ; whereas the Commission feels that the said Article 24 (1) merely confirms one of the restrictions of the Member States power to intervene directly in the operation of the common market organizations with a common price system which are henceforth within the exclusive competence of the Community ; whereas this principle is laid down by consistent judgments of the Court of Justice, particularly in the judgment delivered on 23 January 1975 in Case 51/74 (1) ; whereas that judgment emphasizes in general that, when the Community has adopted rules setting up a common market organization in a given sector, the Member States are bound to refrain from taking any measure which might undermine it or create exceptions to it ; whereas, in this respect, they must have regard not only to the express provisions of the rules but also to their aims and objects (2);\nIV\nWhereas, in introducing aid to maintain farm incomes, the French Government has ignored the principle whereby the Member States are no longer entitled to take unilateral measures in respect of farmers'incomes under a market organization ; whereas the Council, when drawing up common organizations and when fixing the prices of agricultural products, clearly takes account of the objectives and elements of common policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty;\nWhereas it is clear, that in view of the diversity of these objectives, there are priorities which a Member State may not unilaterally overturn without shedding doubt on the options adopted at Community level and without tending to create distortions which would result in affecting trade between Member States;\nWhereas, therefore, the economic and social justification put forward by the French Government cannot be accepted ; whereas the situation of French farmers cannot be assessed exclusively in the light of other social and professional classes at national level but must be assessed in view of the situation of other farmers within the Community ; whereas the improvement in income from aid taking the form of a supplement on prices, even though their impact is fairly low for the beneficiary, is nevertheless such as to improve the conditions of production and the scope for disposal of French products compared with the other Member States ; whereas, furthermore, the social aspect of the measure seems not to be fully ensured, since the aid is granted to all production and to all farms regardless of their economic situations ; whereas, finally, with regard to the reference to the compensation to be granted for application of different rates of refund of VAT between the Member States, this argument may not properly be accepted when assessing the aid ; whereas, although the French Government may, under the sixth Directive on the subject, fix flat-rate refund rates sufficiently low to encourage farmers to opt for the normal VAT system, it cannot, in any circumstances, alter its choice by granting an aid;\nV\nWhereas the result is that grant of the aid decided upon by the French Government is likely to affect trade between the Member State and to distort or threaten competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty;\nWhereas Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty states that aids fulfilling the criteria therein laid down are incompatible in principle with the common market ; whereas exceptions to this incompatibility are set out in paragraph 3 of the said Article and lay down the objectives followed in the Communities'interest and not only in the interest of individual sectors of the  (1) P.
