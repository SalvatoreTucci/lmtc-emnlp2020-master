The introduction of a broader definition of SDMX compliant data formats and a new data structure definition designed in accordance with this standard is therefore required.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 601/2006, in which the use of the data format \u2018Gesmes\u2019 was required as the exclusive means of transmitting data from Member States to the Commission (Eurostat), should be amended in order to also contain references to the SDMX.\n(5) The technical specifications of the data structure should not be of a legally binding nature. Instead, the technical specifications recommended by the Commission should be contained in Eurostat's Balance of Payments Vademecum\u00a0(4), as revised yearly. Regulation (EC) No 601/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Balance of Payments Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 601/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 3 is deleted.\n(3) The Annex is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 June 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 35, 8.2.2005, p. 23.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 601/2006 of 18 April 2006 implementing Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the format and the procedure for the transmission of data (OJ L 106, 19.4.2006, p. 7).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 555/2012 of 22 June 2012 amending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics concerning balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment, as regards the update of data requirements and definitions (OJ L 166, 27.6.2012, p. 22).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Available on the Communication and Information Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses and Citizens of the European Commission (CIRCABC) direct link"}
