The Community shall support a series of energy efficiency actions within the context of this programme, entitled SAVE (Specific Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency) and hereinafter referred to as the 'programme'.\n2. The programme shall last five years.\n3. The Community financial resources estimated as necessary for its implementation amount to ECU 35 million, of which ECU 14 million are for the period 1991 to 1992 in the framework of the 1988 to 1992 financial perspectives.\nFor the subsequent period of implementation of the programme, the amount shall fall within the Community financial framework in force.\n4.

These initiatives shall include:\n- training and information activities with regard to energy efficiency at a level as close as possible to the final consumers of energy,\n- sectoral pilot projects such as those listed in the Annex to this Decision;\n(c) measures to foster the creation of an information network aimed at promoting better coordination between national, Community and international activities through the establishment of appropriate means for exchanging information and at evaluating the  impact of the various measures provided for in this Article;\n(d) measures to implement the programme for improving the efficiency of electricity use adopted by Decision 89/364/EEC.", "1. All costs relating to the measures referred to in Article 2 (a) shall be borne by the Community.\n2. The level of Community support for the measures referred to in Article 2 (b) and (c) shall be between 30 and 50 % of their total cost. The balance may be made up from either government or private funding or by a combination of the two. In exceptional  cases duly justified to the advisory committee referred to in Article 5 (2), Community funding may exceed the 50 % limit, while not exceeding 60 %.\n3.
