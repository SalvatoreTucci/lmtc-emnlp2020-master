The quantity of maize imported into Portugal which can be classified as part of the reduced import duty quota covers 72\u00a0% of the quota. The quantity of sorghum imported into Spain which can be classified as part of the reduced import duty quota covers only 15\u00a0% of the quota. In view of the market conditions in Spain and Portugal, opening invitations to tender until 16 December 2010 is not likely to enable sufficient quantities to cover the quotas to be imported.\n(3) Therefore the invitations to tender for the reduction in the duty on maize and sorghum imported into Spain and maize imported into Portugal should be extended until the 2010 quotas are fully used up and at the latest until the end of May 2011, in accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1296/2008.
