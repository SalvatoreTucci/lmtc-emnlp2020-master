Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(6) Given the need to further examine certain aspects of the investigation, it was decided to continue the investigation without the imposition of provisional measures. On 16 September 2009, all interested parties were provided with an information document detailing the preliminary findings at that stage of the investigation and inviting the parties to comment on those findings.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(7) By a letter of 18 December 2009 to the Commission, Ring Alliance Ringbuchtechnik GmbH formally withdrew its complaint.\n(8) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the European Union of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in Thailand should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain ring binder mechanisms, currently classifiable within CN code ex\u00a08305\u00a010\u00a000 and originating in Thailand, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a051.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a056, 6.3.1996, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0322, 17.12.2008, p.\u00a013."}
