Thus the programme will allow consideration of the appropriate interdisciplinary projects  concerning, for instance,\n- nutrition,\n- zoonosis, and\n- irrigation.\nThis multidisciplinary approach will also be encouraged within each of the areas, with reference, for example, to optimum use of natural resources or optimum environmental protection.\nAREA 1: IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONS\n1. Reduction of food shortages\nThe aim is to increase agricultural, plant and animal production by sustainable methods so as to improve food provision in regions where, for climatic, physical or human reasons, this problem constitutes the first priority.\nThe work will cover:\n(a) production systems; predominantly food production:\nanalysis of the operation and dynamics of these systems, with a view to determining the constraints to achieving sustainable and ecological agriculture;\n(b) plant production:\nfood plant breeding (improvement of their hardiness and yield), protection (diseases, parasites and weeds), with continuing care for the environment so that sustainable solutions are found;\n(c) animal production:\nrole of livestock farming in production systems, forage resources with attention to environmental protection, alternative types of livestock farming in fragile environments and protection of animal health;\n(d) fisheries and aquaculture:\nrational management of resources for coastal fishing; improvement of primary production in a natural environment; nutrition from local products, pathology and breeding in aquaculture;\n(e) restoration of the environment:\nthe study of reforestation, the relation between agriculture, forestry and livestock farming (agroforestry), the regeneration of pastureland, improved water management, soil protection, etc.;\n(f) protection of nature:\nresearch into the operation of buffer zones around areas of unspoilt nature, and research into the viability of non-disruptive commercial use of animal and plant products from such areas.\n2. The development of agricultural production of high economic value\nThe aim is to provide a scientific and technical basis to assess agricultural activities that are of high economic value (including the utilization of the forest and the aquatic environment) at the local level and for exportation in regions where there  is no substantial food shortage.\nThe following forms of production come under this strategic theme:\n(a) main traditional export crops (groundnuts, cotton, coffee, rubber, palm oil etc.);\n(b) secondary crops giving a product of a high added value. Priority will in particular be given to studies into ways of replacing crops used for the production of narcotics with products of high economic value;\n(c) food products (products of animal origin and vegetables) commanding a high price on urban markets or for regional export;\n(d) forests and forestry;\n(e) the production of bioenergy.\nThe work will cover:\n(a) Production systems and the marketing of cash crops:\nanalysis of how they operate, to improve their management and the products' economic impact, and socio-economic studies of the improvements introduced;\n(b) quantitative improvements:\nimprovement of plants or animal breeds, the reduction in losses before and after harvest, and improved farming, forestry and fish-breeding techniques;\n(c) Qualitative improvements:\nthe development of techniques to bring these products up to international trade standards and to improve their commercial value (harvesting, transport, packaging, etc.);\n(d) feasibility studies of local processing;\n(e) environmental protection:\nimpact of intensification of agriculture on the environment, ways of preventing or solving problems and possibilities for improving the natural environment while preserving or increasing its productivity.\nAREA 2: IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH\n1. Prevention and treatment of the predominant diseases in the developing countries\nThe aim is to reduce the impact of these diseases which continue to be the major public health problem in most of the developing countries.\nResearch will focus on: perfecting new methods of diagnosis and adapting existing methods to tropical conditions, using the most advanced techniques of molecular biology and immunology; developing new medicines with the help of innovative strategies for  identifying biochemical targets for chemotherapy; preventing infectious diseases not only by developing vaccines but also by adapting existing vaccines to the specific needs of the developing countries. In the field of parasitology, the emphasis will be  on a multi-antigenic approach taking into account, in certain cases, the different stages in the biological cycle of the parasite; the biology of the vector and its control by combining the traditional methods with the new ones of molecular biology and  genetics.\nResearch into pandemic diseases such as haemoglobinoses, diarrhoea and the sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS, will be directed towards the study of possible intervention strategies, which will allow optimum prevention in the context of the  developing countries' particular social and economic conditions.\nWhen dealing with aims under this heading, particular attention will regularly be given to concertation with other Community projects, such as the biomedical and health programme.\n2. Health care systems appropriate to the rural or urban environment of the developing countries\nThe objective is to study ways of organizing health care taking into account the specific constraints and the socio-economic context of the DCs (financial, human and material resources) and the new opportunities offered by the results of biomedical  research.\nThis research comprises a number of themes, such as the selection, evaluation and validation of health strategies, the management and financing of health services, the study of the optimum development of human resources, the prerequisites for the  transfer of existing and new technologies, and the elucidation of the factors determining the participation of the population.\n3. Nutrition\nThe aim of this research is to develop the scientific basis necessary for improving the nutritional condition of underprivileged populations by means of a multidisciplinary approach between medicine, agronomy, economics and the social sciences. This  embraces research on nutritional interventions, specific shortages, and protection mechanisms in the event of food shortage at the individual, family and community levels.\nANNEX II\nINDICATIVE BREAKDOWN OF THE FUNDS ESTIMATED AS NECESSARY\n(million ecu)\nArea  Breakdown     1. Agriculture  71,43  2. Medicine, health and nutrition  38,46    Total 109,89 (1) (2)\n(1) Including expenditure on staff amounting to ECU 5,49 million and administrative expenditure of ECU 2,51 million.\n(2) A sum of ECU 1,11 million, not included in the ECU 109,89 million, will be earmarked as the contribution of the programme to the centralized scheme for the dissemination and exploitation of results.\nThe breakdown between the areas does not exclude the possibility that projects could cover both areas.\nANNEX III\nRULES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMME AND ACTIVITIES FOR DISSEMINATING AND EXPLOITING THE RESULTS\n1. The Commission will implement the programme on the basis of the scientific and technical content described in Annex I. This programme concerns all developing countries.\n2. The rules for implementing the programme, referred to in Article 3, comprise research and technological development projects, accompanying measures and concerted actions:\nA. Research projects\nThe projects will be the subject of shared-cost research and technological development contracts. Selection of projects must take account of the criteria listed in Annex III to Decision 90/221/Euratom, EEC and of the objectives set out in Annex I to  this Decision.\nFor shared-cost projects Community financial participation will not normally be more than 50 %. Universities and other research centres participating in shared-cost projects will have the option of requesting, for each project, either 50 % funding a  total expenditure or 100 % funding of the additional marginal costs.\nA rate higher than that referred to in the second paragraph for shared-cost projects may be decided on in respect of participants who are DC nationals, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6.\nShared-cost research projects must, as a general rule, be carried out by participants established within the Community and by at least one partner established in a DC. The projects, which may involve, for example, universities, research organizations  and industrial firms, including small and medium-sized enterprises, must, as a general rule, provide for participation by at least two mutually independent partners established in the Member States as well as one partner established in a DC. Contracts  relating to shared-cost research projects must as a general rule be concluded following a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThe Commission will publish a vade-mecum setting out all the rules applying to the selection of projects, in order to guarantee full transparency.\nB. Accompanying measures\nThe accompanying measures referred to in Article 7 will consist of:\n- the organization of seminars, workshops and scientific conferences,\n- internal coordination through the creation of integrating groups,\n- advanced technology training programmes, with emphasis being placed on multidisiplinarity,\n- promotion of the exploitation of results,\n- independent scientific and strategic evaluation of the operation of the projects and the programme.\nC. Concerted actions\nConcerted actions consist of action by the Community to coordinate the individual research activities carried out in the Member States. They may benefit from funding of up to 100 % of coordinating expenditure.\n3. The knowledge acquired in the course of the projects will be disseminated both within the programme and by means of a centralized activity, pursuant to the Decision referred to in Article 4 (3) of Decision 90/221/Euratom, EEC."}
