It also suggested a reflection on a longer-term approach that could take into account technological developments and new strategies regarding compliance and monitoring, with the overall aim of reducing the involvement of tax authorities and reducing the administrative burden on business.\n(2) Furthermore, given the taxpayers\u2019 crucial role in making the VAT system work, and the fact that their relationship with the tax authorities should be based on trust, which could have a considerable influence on the cost of administering the system, the Commission put forward the idea of devising a new approach based on voluntary compliance, risk assessment and monitoring. This approach called upon the expertise of business representatives to contribute to this reflection on the longer-term strategy.\n(3) In March 2010, the business experts group on a smooth functioning of the VAT in the EU, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the business expert group on VAT\u2019 (BEGV), was set up in order to discuss at EU level the actual practical problems that arise from managing the VAT system as it is implemented in the Member States, as well as suggestions for possible solutions for reducing the administrative burden.\n(4) On 23 February 2011, Member States agreed on setting up a new ad hoc expert group, known as the \u2018tax authorities dialogue platform\u2019 (TADP). The much-changed business environment prompted some Member States to develop a customer-led business strategy which is based on understanding the different groups of tax payers/customers, their behaviours and the difficulties they experience when dealing with tax authorities \u2014 from the individual filing of a tax return to the needs of large business. The aim of this approach was to create a level playing field for compliant business for fairer competition and it allowed the tax authorities to allocate resources to combat fraud more efficiently.\n(5) Both experts groups have been set up to prepare the dialogue between tax authorities and business experts which is due to take place at EU level in a new forum.\n(6) With a view to improving the governance of VAT at EU level, in line with the Communication from the Commission on the future of VAT \u2014 Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market\u00a0(2) \u2014, stakeholders have also advocated setting up a channel of communication at EU level, where tax authorities, business representatives and the Commission would be able to exchange views on the practical aspects of VAT administration.\n(7) Identifying best practices on both sides could contribute to streamlining the management of the VAT system, and thereby to reducing compliance costs, while at the same time securing VAT revenue. It is therefore appropriate to set up the EU VAT forum (comprising Member States and stakeholders, and chaired by the Commission) and to define its tasks and its structure.\n(8) The EU VAT forum is a structured platform for dialogue, aimed at improving the relationship between business and tax authorities in order to create the conditions for a smoother functioning of the current VAT system in the EU, thereby reducing costs and administrative burden on both sides. Real practical problems arising from managing the VAT system are due to be discussed, as well as suggestions for possible solutions.\n(9) The forum should be chaired by the Commission and consist of the Member States' tax authorities and of organisations representing business or tax practitioners; authorities and organisations in the Member States will nominate their representatives.\n(10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the forum should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission's rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom\u00a0(3).\n(11) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe group of experts called the \u2018EU VAT forum\u2019, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the forum\u2019, is hereby set up.", "Tasks\nThe forum's tasks shall be:\n(a) to create a platform where business and national tax authorities' experts can informally discuss tax administration issues in the field of VAT with which both parties are currently confronted in a cross-border environment;\n(b) to discuss practical insights provided by tax authorities, as well as business experts, and to elaborate on possible ways to manage the current VAT system more efficiently, including by combating fraud, in the interest of both parties with a view to achieving a smoother functioning of the current VAT system;\n(c) to assist the Commission in promoting good practice including the use of IT, which could culminate in a more efficient, secure, fairer and cost-effective VAT system in the interests of both parties;\n(d) to work, where necessary, in cooperation with any other appropriate bodies or committees dealing with VAT and administrative cooperation in the tax field.", "Consultation\nThe Commission may consult the forum on any matter relating to tax administration in the field of VAT.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The forum shall be composed of a maximum of 45 members.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The forum shall comprise:\n(a) one representative from each Member State;\n(b) representatives of maximum 15 organisations representing business or tax practitioners.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tax authorities of each Member State shall nominate one representative from among the officials dealing with tax administration issues, compliance and services to users in the European VAT environment.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Director-General for Taxation and Customs Union shall appoint organisations referred to in Article 4.2(b) with competence in the areas referred to in Article 2 and which have responded to a call for applications.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organisations shall nominate one representative and an alternate to replace a representative who is absent or indisposed.
