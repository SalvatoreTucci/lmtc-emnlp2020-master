The current maximum levels of the use of extracts of rosemary (E 392) authorised in processed meat and processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans are set according to the fat content in the respective food categories (except for dried sausages and dehydrated meat). The allowed maximum level of use of extracts of rosemary (E 392) set according to the fat content in the respective food categories does not ensure a sufficient protection of food with low fat content since there is a critical minimum dosage of this antioxidant to achieve the desired effect. Currently, extracts of rosemary (E 392) could be used at effective dosages in the products with a higher fat content. However, also the low fat products could be subject to severe oxidation due to a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, it is appropriate to set the maximum level of use of extracts of rosemary (E 392) at 15\u00a0mg/kg for products with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0% while maintaining the allowed maximum level of 150\u00a0mg/kg expressed on fat basis for the products with a fat content higher than 10\u00a0%.\n(6) In 2008 the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) evaluated the safety of extracts of rosemary (E 392) when used as a food additive\u00a0(3) and concluded that the proposed uses and use levels would not be of safety concern. In a conservative estimate of dietary exposure it was assumed by the Authority that the extracts of rosemary would be used at the maximum level of use (i.e. at 150\u00a0mg/kg in processed meat, poultry and fish/seafood products) in all the proposed foods in each food category. This assumption covered also non-heat-treated and heat-treated processed meat and processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0%.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. In view of the aforesaid Authority\u2019s opinion of 2008, setting the maximum level of use of extracts of rosemary (E 392) at 15\u00a0mg/kg for non-heat-treated and heat-treated processed meat and processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0% constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, therefore, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.\n(8) Following the above, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal (2008) 721, 1-29.\nANNEX\nPart E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in food category 08.2.1 \u2018Non-heat-treated processed meat\u2019 the entry concerning the additive \u2018E 392 \u2014 Extracts of rosemary \u2014 excluding dried sausages\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 392 Extracts of rosemary 15 (46) only meat with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0%, excluding dried sausages\nE 392 Extracts of rosemary 150 (41) (46) only meat with a fat content higher than 10\u00a0%, excluding dried sausages\u2019\n(2) in food category 08.2.2 \u2018Heat-treated processed meat\u2019 the entry concerning the additive \u2018E 392 \u2014 Extracts of rosemary \u2014 excluding dried sausages\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 392 Extracts of rosemary 15 (46) only meat with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0%, excluding dried sausages\nE 392 Extracts of rosemary 150 (41) (46) only meat with a fat content higher than 10\u00a0%, excluding dried sausages\u2019\n(3) in food category 09.2 \u2018Processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans\u2019 the entry concerning the additive E 392 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 392 Extracts of rosemary 15 (46) only fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans with a fat content not higher than 10\u00a0%\nE 392 Extracts of rosemary 150 (41) (46) only fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans with a fat content higher than 10\u00a0%\u2019"}
