As essential elements of that Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law form the basis of our relations.\nBy letter dated 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and to take appropriate measures within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nBy letter dated 15 February 2010, the European Union informed you of its decision not to revoke the appropriate measures and to extend their period of application until 20 February 2011.\nSince the establishment of the Government of National Unity (GNU) in 2009, the progress achieved based on the Global Political Agreement (GPA) has been welcomed by the European Union. The European Union reiterates the great importance it attaches to the political dialogue, provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, and officially launched at the request of the Government of Zimbabwe at the EU-Zimbabwe Ministerial Troika on 18-19 June 2009 in Brussels. At the most recent Ministerial Meeting of 2 July 2010, an inclusive Zimbabwean Delegation headed by Minister Mangoma, handed over an updated version of the GPA Commitment Plan. The European Union took note of the progress made so far in the implementation of the GPA and informed the Government of Zimbabwe by letter dated 29 September 2010 of the 10th EDF indicative allocation (EUR\u00a0130 million to become available upon lifting of Article 96 and signing of a Country Strategy Paper). The European Union remains committed to further intensifying the Article 8 political dialogue.\nThe European Union supports the ongoing efforts of the GNU to implement the GPA, and welcomes the achievements made in stabilising the economy and restoring basic social services. However, the European Union regrets the lack of progress on key political agreements of the GPA.\nThe European Union encourages all parties forming the GNU to remain committed to the implementation of the democratic reforms as set out in the GPA. The European Union considers progress in this area, such as an understanding between all parties to the GNU on concrete steps towards creating an environment for peaceful and credible elections, to be of great importance.\nIn this context, the European Union welcomes intensified regional diplomacy and the efforts of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and its Member States to create an environment conducive to elections.\nIn light of the above, the European Union has decided to extend until 20 February 2012 the period of application of the appropriate measures set out in Council Decision 2002/148/EC and adapted in Council Decision 2010/97/CFSP. The European Union would like to assure Zimbabwe of its continued willingness to engage itself and to review at any time the restrictions on development cooperation. We would hope that concrete progress on the ground could be made to allow for full cooperation to resume. In this context, the European Union will closely follow the steps made by the Government of Zimbabwe towards ensuring credible elections.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the European Union"}
