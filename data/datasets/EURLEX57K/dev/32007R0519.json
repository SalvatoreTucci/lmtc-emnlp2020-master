That authorisation expired on 31 December 2006.\n(2) The use of malic acid is an oenological practice approved by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.\n(3) Negotiations are currently underway between the Community and Mercosur, of which Argentina is a member, on an agreement on trade in wine. These negotiations concern, in particular, the respective oenological practices used by both parties and the protection of geographical indications.\n(4) Pending the entry into force of an agreement between the Community and Mercosur on trade in wine mutually recognising the oenological practices of each Party and thus facilitating the import into the Community of wines originating in Argentina to which malic acid may have been added, the authorisation of this process for Argentinian wines should be extended until the date of that entry into force, but not later than 31 December 2008.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 527/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In the second subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 527/2003, the date \u201831 December 2006\u2019 is hereby replaced by \u201831 December 2008\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.
