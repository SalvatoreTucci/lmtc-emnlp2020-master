Accordingly, those amendments should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(10) Taking into account the number of amendments that need to be made to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009, it is appropriate to replace it by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2011.\nHowever, the following amendments to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 shall apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation:\n(a) the deletion of the following entries on:\n(i) trace elements from China;\n(ii) mangoes from the Dominican Republic;\n(iii) the following feed and food from Vietnam:\n\u2014 groundnuts (peanuts), in shell,\n\u2014 groundnuts (peanuts), shelled,\n\u2014 peanut butter,\n\u2014 groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved;\n(b) the amendment on the frequency of physical and identity checks for the following food from all third countries:\n(i) chilli (Capsicum annuum), crushed or ground;\n(ii) chilli products (curry);\n(iii) Curcuma longa (turmeric);\n(iv) red palm oil.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 11.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\n(A)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), in shell\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), shelled\n\u2014\n\u2014 Peanut butter\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved\n\u2014 2008\u00a011\u00a091;
