Analysis must be performed on homogeneous and representative samples of the meat preparation or preserve.\n1.2. The methods of analysis to be used are as follows:\n1.2.1. Nitrogen: determination of the nitrogen content in meat and meat-based products \u2014 ISO 937: 1978.\n1.2.2. Moisture: determination of the moisture content in meat and meat-based products \u2014 ISO 1442: 1973.\n1.2.3. Fat: determination of the total fat content in meat and meat-based products \u2014 ISO 1443: 1973.\n1.2.4. Ash: determination of the ash content in meat and meat-based products \u2014 ISO 936: 1978.\n1.3. The requirements of the abovementioned ISO standards concerning the sampling procedure are not mandatory for the purposes of this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of meat content\nThe meat content of meat shall be calculated by means of the following formula:\nmeat-based\nNT = Where NT is the total nitrogen as determined by analysis (%)\nNx = is the nitrogen of extraneous origin (%)\nThe total nitrogen content shall be determined by the method referred to at point 1.2.1. Furthermore, the quantitative determination of moisture (1.2.2.), fat (1.2.3.) and ash (1.2.4.) enables the content of the other ingredients to be deduced.\nIn order to make corrections concerning the nitrogen of extraneous origin (Nx), it is necessary to know the quantity of each nitrogen-containing ingredient and the nitrogen content of these ingredients. The following table shows the average nitrogen content in a number of nitrogen-containing ingredients that may be present in meat preparations or preserves.\nNon-meat products Nitrogen percentage\nRusk 2,0\nCasein 15,8\nSodium caseinate 14,8\nSoya proteins isolate 14,5\nTextured soya proteins 8,0\nSoya flour 8,0\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) 8,3\nBeef kidneys 2,7\nBeef tongue 3,0\nIn regard to the repeatability of the analysis methods, reference should be made to the above-mentioned ISO standards.\nThe result to be taken into consideration is the average of at least two determinations."}
