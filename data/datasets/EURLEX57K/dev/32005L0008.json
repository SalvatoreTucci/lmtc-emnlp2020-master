For environmental reasons, the level of phosphorus in animal feed is restricted and the digestibility and bioavailability of phosphorus is improved by making use of an enzyme such as phytase. It is therefore no longer appropriate to establish the maximum level as per 1\u00a0% of phosphorus but to establish the maximum level for complementary feed relative to a feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%.\n(7) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive twelve months after the entry into force at the latest.
