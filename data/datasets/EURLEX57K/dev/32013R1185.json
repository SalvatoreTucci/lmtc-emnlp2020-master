It must contain the following meat ingredients: skinned throats (\u2265\u00a025\u00a0%), liver (\u2265\u00a020\u00a0%), cooked rinds (\u2265\u00a05\u00a0%) and fresh onions (\u2265\u00a05\u00a0%). The meat ingredients and the onions must be fresh.\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 is composed of several large, coarsely minced pieces distributed uniformly throughout a slice. Its colour is darkish, its texture firm and it has a pronounced taste of meat, liver and onions.\nIn addition to the ingredients which must be present in \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019, non-meat ingredients represent a maximum of 15\u00a0% of the total mass used, onions excluded: water (in all its forms), broth \u2264\u00a05\u00a0%, sugars (saccharose, dextrose, lactose) \u2264\u00a01\u00a0%, fresh whole eggs, fresh egg whites \u2264\u00a02\u00a0% by weight of dry matter/stuffing, flour, starches \u2264\u00a03\u00a0%, ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate (max. 0,03\u00a0% of the total mass used), jelly and pig\u2019s G gelatin, salt: \u2264\u00a02\u00a0%, pepper: \u2264\u00a00,3\u00a0%, other spices (nutmeg, garlic, shallot, parsley, thyme, laurel), ciders and apple-based spirits (eau-de-vie, lambig, etc.), Chouchen, sodium or potassium nitrite, plain caramel for the browning.\nThe following ingredients, taken together, must not exceed 1,7\u00a0% of the total mass used: jelly and pig\u2019s G gelatin, nutmeg, garlic, shallot, parsley, thyme, laurel, ciders and apple-based spirits (eau-de-vie, lambig, etc.), Chouchen, sodium or potassium nitrite.\nDuring production, the diameter of the chopped pieces is varied according to the shape of the p\u00e2t\u00e9s in order to achieve a satisfying appearance, whatever the size of the slice:\n\u2014 For packaging sizes \u2265\u00a0200\u00a0g => diameter of pieces \u2265\u00a08\u00a0mm,\n\u2014 For packaging sizes \u2265\u00a0200\u00a0g => diameter of pieces \u2265\u00a06\u00a0mm.\nThe pieces are then mixed with the fine stuffing consisting of the minced meat and non-meat ingredients. The fats may be scalded and added warm to the stuffing. The stuffing is then packed and cooked in the oven or aseptically canned (packed in a metal can, a glass bowl or a jar).\nIn the case of products that are presented fresh, the preparation is covered with a fresh pig\u2019s caul and cooked in the oven in order to obtain a characteristic crust. The preserved p\u00e2t\u00e9s are browned in the oven until a brown crust forms and then set and sterilised.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nIn order to reduce the presence of animals bearing genetically unfavourable characteristics, the pigs must be free of allele RN less.\nThe meats used in the production of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 must derive from pig carcasses weighing more than 80 kilograms. Carcasses that are too light and of low nutritional and technological quality are excluded.\nIn order to limit stress, which is detrimental to the quality of the meat and fat, the animals must be free of the allele making them sensitive to halothane and there must be a minimum period of two hours between the unloading of the animal at the slaughterhouse and the time of slaughter.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nThe specification does not refer to any specific requirements.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe production of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 is carried out in the geographical area.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 is presented:\n\u2014 either fresh and packed in a terrine, under film or a modified atmosphere or under vacuum, or\n\u2014 fresh and cut at the place of production, or\n\u2014 fresh, sliced and packed under film or a modified atmosphere or under vacuum for self-service sale, or\n\u2014 aseptically canned and packed in a glass bowl, a metal can or a jar.\nIts weight varies between 40\u00a0g and 10\u00a0kg.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe labelling must include the following elements: the name of the PGI, \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019, the name and address of the certifying body and, if applicable, its certified collective mark pursuant to the rules governing its use, as well as the European Union PGI logo.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area is the traditional production area of this product. It comprises the total areas of the following departments: C\u00f4tes-d\u2019Armor, Finist\u00e8re, Ille-et-Vilaine, Loire-Atlantique and Morbihan.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nHistoric Brittany corresponds to the traditional production area of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019. Brittany has a centuries-long charcuterie-making tradition. In the days of Ducal Brittany in the 16th century, Breton families slaughtered their pigs and made their own cured meats.\nBretons have turned this distinctive factor to good use in the production of a wide variety of charcuterie products, in particular \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019, which made it possible to avoid wasting offal and meat leftovers from the cutting up of a pig.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe specificity of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 is based on a specific quality and special know-how as well as on the product\u2019s reputation.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific quality\nThe liver, the throat, the rind and possibly the edible parts of the head or the heart went into making P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019. The liver, which was considered a fine part of the animal, gives the p\u00e2t\u00e9 its taste, colour, smoothness and special flavour. Throats, cooked rinds and onions are three other indispensable traditional ingredients of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019, which also contribute to the product\u2019s specific organoleptic characteristics. The onions, found in most traditional Breton recipes, are used for seasoning.\nThe liver, lean meat and fat used in the product must be minced coarsely. The presence of large pieces of meat has to do with the production methods used formerly. Today, in order to preserve this special feature, charcuterie producers must master the mincing method in order to obtain pieces with a large diameter.\nThe presence of a caul on top of the p\u00e2t\u00e9, formerly used to shape the filling and protect the product, is still an obligatory feature of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 when presented fresh, in order to preserve its traditional appearance.\nThis makes it possible to obtain specific organoleptic characteristics: a firm and crisp texture, a pronounced taste of meat, cooked pork, liver and onions.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another characteristic: special know-how\nThe former practice was to use the meats immediately after the pig was cut up. In the old days, the mechanical tools (meat axes, knives) used to cut up the pig and the meats resulted in large pieces and therefore in a coarsely minced p\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne.\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 used to be cooked in the baker\u2019s or village\u2019s bread oven, in open dishes called \u2018plats sabots\u2019 or \u2018casse \u00e0 p\u00e2t\u00e9\u2019 or in receptacles. Cooking in a dry oven in open dishes causes the sugars to caramelise and provokes reactions that contribute to the brown colour of the crust. Prior to cooking, the p\u00e2t\u00e9 was also covered with a pig\u2019s caul intended to smoothen, shape and protect the preparation. It prevented the stuffing from running out and the product from drying. \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 owes its specificities to its production method, which has been passed on from generation to generation in the charcuterie trade and is officially recognised, as shown by the fact that a special definition of it is included in the \u2018Code des usages de la Charcuterie, de la Salaison et des Conserves de Viandes\u2019, under the category \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne sup\u00e9rieur\u2019.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A reputation\nIn line with the tradition of family-based production, the small-scale production of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 has been maintained over the years. In olden times, this home-made dish was prepared after the \u2018Fest an oc\u2019h\u2019, a feast held in connection with the sacrifice of pigs.\nTrue to its reputation, \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 has an important place in France\u2019s culinary heritage.\nFor more than 30 years, Brittany\u2019s manufacturers have worked together to perpetuate the reputation and specificity of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019. It is a charcuterie product that is appreciated by distributors and consumers alike.\nBrittany\u2019s fish canning industry developed strongly at the end of the 19th century. Soon these companies started preserving other foods too by canning them aseptically. In fact, \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 was canned aseptically for the first time several decades ago. Nowadays, consumers appreciate both fresh and aseptically canned \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 derives from a long tradition of pig rearing and from the processing of pigs at their place of rearing. Very early on, Brittany\u2019s agricultural system started focusing on rearing, in particular on the rearing of pigs on each holding.\nIn this way producers learned to process all of the pieces of meat at their disposal. As production started immediately after the animal was cut up, the freshness of the product was guaranteed at a time when meat preservation methods were limited.\nTraditionally, all the edible parts of the pig were used, which gave the product a particular texture and taste. The use of livers, considered a fine part of the pig at the beginning of the 20th century, soon became one of the principal characteristics of \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019, giving it a pinkish colour and a very specific taste.\nProducers made use of the extensive range of vegetables grown locally by introducing onions into \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019. The presence of onions contributes to the product\u2019s particular taste, because during cooking, the fruity taste of the onions comes to the fore and complements the meaty taste perfectly.\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 results from the know-how of the producers, who have succeeded in giving the product special characteristics. In addition to the ingredients used, the coarse mincing of the meat pieces makes it easy to identify the product when it is sliced. The brown crust is linked definitively to the product through a traditional cooking process in communal ovens.\nAs regards the p\u00e2t\u00e9\u2019s reputation, several works classify \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 as a traditional Breton product or give its recipe. Many Breton guides, such as \u2018Le Finist\u00e8re gourmand 1997/1998\u2019, contain references to the numerous Breton specialities and praise \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 in particular. Similarly, the \u2018Terroir de Bretagne\u2019 guide praises the Breton charcuterie tradition: \u2018(\u2026) Forty, even fifty, kilograms of \u201cP\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u201d are produced every week by a country charcuterie-maker. Each producer jealously guards his own recipe, although all adhere to the following basic proportions: 1/3 offal and 2/3 throat (\u2026)\u2019. \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 is referred to in numerous old and new cookbooks:\n\u2014 \u2018Gastronomie bretonne d\u2019hier et d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui\u2019 (S. Morand, 1965),\n\u2014 \u2018Les cuisines de France \u2014 Bretagne\u2019 (M. Raffael and D. Lozambard, 1990),\n\u2014 \u2018Tout est bon dans le cochon\u2019 (J. C. Frentz, C. Vence, 1988),\n\u2014 \u2018L\u2019inventaire du patrimoine culinaire de la France, Bretagne \u2014 Produits du terroir et recettes traditionnelles\u2019 (CNAC, 1994),\n\u2014 \u2018Le bottin gourmand\u2019 1996,\n\u2014 \u2018La France des saveurs\u2019, Gallimard 1997,\n\u2014 \u2018Vivre ici, hors Bretagne\u2019 1994.\nThe product\u2019s reputation is thus well linked to its name and attributable to the geographical area.\nThese factors taken together make it very easy to distinguish \u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne Breton\u2019 from other p\u00e2t\u00e9s and guarantee a typical method of production rooted in the product\u2019s region of origin.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nhttps://www.inao.gouv.fr/fichier/CDCIGPPateDeCampagneBretonV2.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
