PROCEDURE\n(1) The Commission received a complaint lodged by the Comit\u0102\u0160 de Liaison des Producteurs de Ferroalliages de la CEE on behalf of producers representing substantially all Community production of high carbon ferro-chromium. The complaint contained evidence  of dumping and injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an  anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of ferro-chromium containing by weight more than 6 % of carbon falling within CN code 7202 41 90 originating in Albania and the USSR, and subsequently commenced an investigation.\n(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representative of the USSR and the Community producers. The parties concerned were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing, to request a  hearing and to answer the questionnaires addressed to them seeking the information the Commission deemed to be necessary for the assessment of dumping and injury. None of the complainant Community producers replied to the questionnaires or requested an  extension of the time limit for reply set up by the Commission.\n(3) As a result, the allegations of injury contained in the complaint could not be further investigated and verified. Therefore, the Commission considers that it is not possible to make a determination on injury or threat of injury with respect to the  Community industry concerned.\nB. TERMINATION OF PROCEEDING\n(4) In view of the circumstances set out above the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of high carbon ferro-chromium originating in Albania and the USSR should be terminated forthwith.\n(5) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objections.\n(6) The complainant was informed of the Commission's reasons to terminate the proceeding and did not comment,", "main_body": ["  Sole Article  The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ferro-chromium containing by weight more than 6 % of carbon orginating in Albania and the USSR and falling with CN code 7202 41 90 is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 April 1991.
