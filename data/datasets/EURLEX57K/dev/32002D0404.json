Decision 95/196/EC has been substantially amended a number of times. In the interests of clarity and rationalisation, therefore, Decision 95/196/EC should be recast.\n(4) Under Article 142 of the Act of Accession, Finland should be authorised to grant long-term national aids intended to ensure that agricultural activity is maintained in northern regions as determined by the Commission.\n(5) In order to facilitate the administration of the scheme when determining those regions, the municipality (kunta) should be chosen as the relevant administrative unit.\n(6) Taking account of the factors referred to in Article 142(1) and (2) of the Act of Accession it is appropriate to specify the administrative units in subregions C1, C2, C2 North, C3 and C4 which are north of the 62nd Parallel or adjacent to the latter, and which are affected by comparable climatic conditions rendering agricultural activity particularly difficult. These subregions have a population density lower than or equal to 10 inhabitants per square kilometre, a utilised agricultural area (UAA) considered to constitute 10 % or less of the overall surface area of the municipality and a portion of the UAA devoted to arable crops intended for human consumption less than or equal to 20 %. Municipalities surrounded by others within such areas should be entered on the list, even where they do not satisfy the same requirements.\n(7) The northern region thus determined represents 1417000 hectares (ha), accounting for 55,5 % of the total UAA of Finland.\n(8) The reference period in relation to which the development of agricultural production and the level of overall support is to be considered, using the national statistics available as a basis, should cover 1991, 1992 and 1993 as regards agricultural production. However, for cow's milk and beef and veal 1992 provides the best basis for fixing the milk quota and the reference herd for Finland, and for horticulture 1993 is the year covered by the most reliable statistics. Moreover, 1993 (when prices had not yet been affected by accession) should be used for assessing the level of overall support, where the difference in the price level of support existing between Finland and the Community must be taken into account.\n(9) The aid measures meet the conditions laid down in Article 142(3) of the Act of Accession. Those measures take account of the compensatory allowances, the agri-environmental aid and the aid provided for under the common organisation of the markets (CMO). They also take account of the incentive element of the agricultural State aid N 148/97. They are not likely to lead to any increase in overall support or, where they are accompanied by the necessary measures, to any increase in production as compared with the respective reference period.\n(10) In respect of cow's milk, any increase in production is controlled by the quota system provided for under the CMO. In the case of other products, the aid is not granted on the basis of the quantities produced, but on the basis of production factors (livestock units (LU) or ha) within the total limits laid down by this Decision. In the case of heifers for slaughter, which fall outside the milk production network, the aid is granted by head.\n(11) The transport aid envisaged may be authorised under the third subparagraph of Article 142(3) of the Act of Accession. Where authorisation is granted for any transport aid under a national regional aid scheme, it should be ensured that compensation is not provided twice under the various aid schemes for the same activity.\n(12) The aid envisaged for storage of horticultural products and wild berries and mushrooms may be authorised since it facilitates the disposal of those products as referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 142(3) of the Act of Accession.\n(13) The aid for the breeding, processing and marketing of reindeer is in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 827/68.\n(14) The aid measures envisaged meet the objectives set out in the third subparagraph of Article 142(3) of the Act of Accession since they are designed to maintain traditional primary production and processing particularly suited to the climatic conditions of the regions concerned, to improve the structures for the production, marketing and processing of agricultural products, to facilitate the disposal of the said products and to ensure that the environment is protected and countryside preserved.\n(15) Accordingly, the aid measures envisaged may be authorised provided that they comply with the limits laid down for relevant products under the respective CMO, namely Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999(5) of 17 May 1999 for beef and veal, Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 for sugar(6), and Council Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 of 19 December 2001 for sheepmeat and goatmeat(7).\n(16) It is appropriate to allow some flexibility in the number of units covered by aid and the aid payable within certain production sectors or subsectors to reflect the change in consumption patterns since this is in conformity with the principles of the aid scheme.\n(17) A measure of flexibility earlier foreseen for field-scale crop production should continue to apply to field-scale vegetables.\n(18) The production factors in subregional levels should be indicative ones and they should be taken into account only in the event of a foreseen overrun in quantities. This will maintain the maximum number of hectares or animals covered by the aid in total level and at the same time help in improving the production structures in subregional levels and it is in conformity with the principles of the aid scheme.\n(19) Inclusion of the \"SLOM\" quantities allocated in 1999 and 2000 justify certain amendments to the factors for milk. Furthermore, as the aid for cow's milk is paid per kg, the quantity expressed in production factors should be amended to refer to tonnes of milk. For this purpose, the existing amount of individual quotas for each subregion should be taken into account.\n(20) Article 3(2)(c) of Decision 95/196/EC has allowed aid to be paid to the individual reference quantity allocated pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3950/92 of 28 December 1992 establishing an additional levy in the milk and milk products sector(8) after the reallocation of any unused reference quantities in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) of that Regulation. The change in production factor for milk will significantly amend the current practice, both as regards the administration and the application at the level of individual farm. Therefore, a transitional period of three years should be allowed.\n(21) Any amendments to the aid authorised by this Decision as a result of a review, in particular on the basis of changes in the CMO or in the rate of authorised national agricultural aid, should not apply until the year following that in which they are adopted in order to protect the legitimate expectations of the recipients.\n(22) In view of the nature and the scope of the differences between the measures provided for in this Decision and those provided for by decision 95/196/EC, and having regard to the request of Finland, it is appropriate that this Decision should apply from 1 January 2002,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe purpose of this Decision is to authorise the long-term national aid scheme for agriculture in the northern region of Finland comprising the municipal units (kunta) listed under the relevant subregion in Annex I.", "Reference periods\nThe reference period provided for in Article 142(3) of the Act of Accession shall be as follows:\n(a) as regards production:\n- 1992 for cow's milk and for cattle,\n- 1993 for horticulture,\n- the average for 1991, 1992 and 1993 for other products;\n(b) as regards the level of overall support 1993.", "Authorised aid\n1.
