whereas the prices, aids and other amounts for the various intervention measures to be adopted for that wine year should accordingly be fixed on  that basis;\nWhereas, following the alignment of guide prices in Portugal on Community guide prices and in the absence of special measures, this Regulation applies to Portugal; whereas, however, since wine-growing zones have not been delimited in that country, the  oenological practices authorized in accordance with the rules laid down under Title II of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and the varieties of vines authorized for the production of table wines in Portugal should be defined; whereas, since enrichment  is an exceptional practice, the same reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and laid down in Annex VIII should be applied as in wine-growing zone C; whereas, in accordance with Article 341 of  the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal the derogations in force for 'vinho verde';\nWheres, pursuant to Article 70 of the Act of Accession, from this marketing year Spanish prices are set at the same level as the common prices and therefore the prices and aid, as well as the other amounts applicable for 1992/93, laid down in this  Regulation apply in that country;\nWhereas distillers may, in accordance with Articles 35 (6) and 36 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, either receive aid for the product to be distilled or deliver the product obtained from distillation to the intervention agency; whereas the amount of  the aid must be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89 (4);\nWhereas the price of wine to be distilled under Articles 38 and 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 does not normally allow the marketing at market prices of products obtained from distillation; whereas provision must therefore be made for aid, the amount  of which is to be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89, account also being taken of the present uncertainty of prices on the market for distillation products;\nWhereas some wine delivered for one of the distillation operations may be processed into wine fortified for distillation; whereas the amounts applicable to distillation in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89  should be adjusted accordingly;\nWhereas experience gained in sales by invitation to tender of alcohol held by intervention agencies shows that the difference between prices which may be obtained for neutral spirits and raw alcohol does not justify the takeover of the former; whereas,  moreover, quantities of neutral spirits currently available are sufficient to satisfy, at least for one wine year, any demand for that product; whereas under these circumstances the possibility provided for in Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Regulation (EEC)  No 822/87 should be used by limiting deliveries of neutral spirits to intervention agencies for the 1992/93 wine year;\nWhereas the aid for the use in wine-making of concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must as provided for in Article 45 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 must be fixed taking into account the difference between the cost of enrichment  achieved using concentrated grape must and using sucrose; whereas, in the light of the data available to the Commission, the amount of the aid should be varied with the product used for enrichment; whereas, however, pursuant to Article 128 of the Act of  Accession, there should be a different level of aid for Spain;\nWhereas Article 46 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 lays down criteria for fixing the aid provided for in that Article; whereas, as regards the aid for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must for the manufacture of grape juice,  paragraph 4 of that Article stipulates that a part of the aid should be set aside for the organization of campaigns to promote the consumption of grape juice and whereas the aid may be increased to that end; whereas, having regard to the criteria laid  down and to the need to finance those campaigns, the aid should be fixed at a level permitting sufficient quantities to be obtained for the effective promotion of the product;\nWhereas the reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 depends on the average increase in the natural alcoholic strength in each wine-growing zone; whereas experience shows that that increase  corresponds on average to half the maximum increase authorized; whereas the reduction in the buying-in price must accordingly correspond to the added alcoholic strength as a percentage of the alcoholic strength of wine delivered for distillation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["This Regulation fixes the buying-in prices, the aids and certain other amounts applicable for the 1992/93 wine year to intervention measures in the wine sector in the Community.

Products eligible under this measure shall have a natural alcoholic strength by volume of at least 7,5 % vol, before enrichment and total alcoholic strength by volume of not more than 13 %  after enrichment.\nHowever, products upstream of table wine originting in the 'Vinho verdi' region must have an alcoholic strength by volume of at least 7 % before enrichment.\nThe addition of concentrated grape must or rectified concentrated grape must shall not have the effect of increasing the initial volume of fresh crushed grapes, grape must, grape must in fermentation or new wine still in fermentation by more than 6,5 %;\n(b) fresh grapes, grape must, grape must in fermentation, new wine still in fermentation and wine may be the subject of acidification or deacidification.\n2.
