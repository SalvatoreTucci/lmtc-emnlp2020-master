That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a new use of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) as a feed additive for pigs for fattening and minor porcine species for fattening other than Sus scrofa domesticus, and turkeys for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009\u00a0(2), for weaned piglets by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1088/2011\u00a0(3) and for laying hens and minor poultry species for fattening and laying by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 989/2012\u00a0(4).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) in its opinions of 12 March 2013\u00a0(5) confirmed its previous conclusions that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority concluded that the additive has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance in pigs for fattening and that this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor porcine species for fattening other than Sus scrofa domesticus. The Authority also concluded that the additive has the potential to improve the final body weight and feed to gain ratio in turkeys for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009 of 13 November 2009 concerning the authorisation of an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Aveve NV) (OJ L 299, 14.11.2009, p. 6).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1088/2011 of 27 October 2011 concerning the authorisation of an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) as a feed additive for weaned piglets (holder of authorisation Aveve NV) (OJ L 281, 28.10.2011, p. 14).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 989/2012 of 25 October 2012 concerning the authorisation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) as a feed additive for laying hens and minor poultry species for fattening and laying (holder of authorisation Aveve NV)\n(OJ L 297, 26.10.2012, p. 11).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(4):3171 and EFSA Journal 2013; 11(4):3172.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
