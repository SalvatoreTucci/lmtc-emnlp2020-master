Demand of consumers in the Community is increasing, especially for high-quality beef. An additional reduced-tariff-quota for high-quality beef would satisfy at the same time the consumer interests as well as supplier interests.\n(3) Equal and continuous access to the quota should be offered to all operators concerned in the Community and appropriate monitoring of the quota should be ensured. To this end, the utilisation of the quota should be based on the presentation of a certificate of authenticity guaranteeing the type and origin of the products.\n(4) Under Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), tariff quotas for the products covered by the present Regulation are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with detailed rules adopted under the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the said Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
