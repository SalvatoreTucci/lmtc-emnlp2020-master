The aid shall be paid to the manufacturer of casein or caseinates.\n2. Manufacturers of casein or caseinates shall include the aid in the purchase price paid to the suppliers of skimmed milk, either directly or indirectly through the suppliers of raw casein.\n3.

The aid may vary, according to whether the skimmed milk is processed into casein or into caseinates and according to the quality of those products.\n2. Aid shall be so fixed that the return on skimmed milk processed into casein or caseinates is equivalent to that on skimmed milk processed into skimmed milk powder, calculated:    - on the basis of the intervention price, or\n- on the basis of the market price for first-quality, spray-process skimmed milk powder, if that price exceeds the intervention price.\nShould Community measures have the effect, in a Member State, of increasing the price at which the intervention agency buys in skimmed milk powder, the aid may be increased by a corresponding amount in that Member State.", "To determine the return on skimmed milk processed into casein or caseinates, the price of casein or caseinates shall be calculated for a product of first quality on the basis of:    (a) the world market price of the product in question, plus customs duties and a fixed amount for transport and certain frontier-crossing costs, or\n(b) the price in the Community of the product in question.", "The necessary provisions shall be adopted in order to ensure, for the parties concerned, adequate stability in the amount of the aid.
