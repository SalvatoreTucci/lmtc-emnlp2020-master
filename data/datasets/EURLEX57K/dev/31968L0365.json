whereas in this respect the Programmes make no distinction between industrial undertakings and small craft undertakings as regards the date of liberalisation ; whereas it is in fact impossible to prescribe a later date for the liberalisation of small craft undertakings, as the legal definitions of small craft industries vary widely from one country to another and distortions could occur if liberalisation of undertakings with like economic structures were to take place at different times ; whereas, moreover, the co-ordination of legislation in respect of small craft industries requires extensive preparatory work, which would only delay the application of liberalisation measures ; whereas, however, the abolition of restrictions in respect of foreign nationals must be accompanied by transitional measures designed to alleviate the effects of disparities between provisions of national laws, such measures being dealt with in a separate Directive;\nWhereas the present Directive does not apply to itinerant trading as defined in the second subparagraph of Article 2 (1) of the Council Directive of 15 October 1968 5 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in retail trade (ISIC ex Group 612), that is commercial activities of hawkers or pedlars, and activities of persons who sell in open-air markets and of those who sell in covered markets but not from permanently fixed installations;\nWhereas it does not apply to the primary production of foodstuffs and beverages by agriculture, including viticulture, or by forestry, hunting or fishing, nor to the processing of fish carried out on board fishing vessels or factory ships ; whereas those activities will be liberalised under other Directives;\nWhereas, since the adoption of the General Programmes, the European Communities have drawn up their own nomenclature of industrial activities, entitled \"Nomenclature of Industries in the European Communities\" (NICE) ; whereas this nomenclature, which contains references to national nomenclature, is, while following the same decimal classification, better adapted to the needs of the Member States of the Community than the ISIC nomenclature (International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities) ; whereas the NICE nomenclature should therefore be used for the classification of the activities to be liberalised in cases where a Directive covers a large number of activities and it is necessary, in order to facilitate implementation of  1OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62. 2OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 32/62. 3OJ No 23, 5.2.1966, p. 345/66. 4OJ No 14, 25.1.1966, p. 211/66. 5OJ No L 260, 22.10.1968, p. 1.\nthe Directive in question, to list such activities in detail, provided that this will not have the effect of altering the timetable laid down in the General Programmes, which was drawn up on the basis of the ISIC nomenclature ; whereas in the present case adoption of the NICE nomenclature cannot have such effect;\nWhereas separate Directives, applicable to all activities of self-employed persons, concerning provisions relating to the movement and residence of beneficiaries, and where necessary Directives on the co-ordination of the safeguards required by Member States of companies or firms for the protection of the interests of members and of others, have been or will be adopted;\nWhereas the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment provides that restrictions on the right to join professional or trade organisations must be abolished where the professional activities of the person concerned necessarily involve the exercise of this right;\nWhereas the position of paid employees accompanying a person providing services or acting on his behalf will be governed by the provisions laid down in pursuance of Articles 48 and 49 of the Treaty;\nWhereas the retail sales activities of manufacturers who, without being established as producers in the host country, themselves sell their products in that country to the final consumer are governed by the provisions of the Council Directive of 15 October 1968 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in retail trade (ISIC ex Group 612) ; whereas therefore this Directive does not apply to such activities;", "main_body": ["Member States shall abolish, in respect of the natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services (hereinafter called \"beneficiaries\"), the restrictions referred to in Title III of those General Programmes affecting the right to take up and pursue the activities specified in Article 2 of this Directive.", "1.

However, such posts may be reserved for nationals where, in pursuance of any provision laid down by law or regulation, the organisation concerned is connected with the exercise of official authority.\n3. In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, membership of the Chambre de commerce or of the Chambre des m\u00e9tiers shall not give beneficiaries the right to take part in the election of the administrative organs of those Chambers.", "No Member State shall grant to any of its nationals who go to another Member State for the purpose of pursuing any activity referred to in Article 2 any aid liable to distort the conditions of establishment.", "1. Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 2 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the \"judicial record\" or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.\nWhere the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue such documentary proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath made by the person concerned before a judical or administrative authority, a notary, or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country whence that person comes.\n2.
