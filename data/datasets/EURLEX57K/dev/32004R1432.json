For the purposes of these obligations, the above Article 5 lays down a timetable based, in particular, on the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2366/1998 and 1 May 1998 as the date from which new planting is excluded from all future aid schemes, unless covered by a programme approved by the Commission. Certain of the dates provided for in Article 5 should be adapted to enable the new producer Member States to apply it, taking account of the final date fixed for Cyprus and Malta.\n(5) Article 12a of Regulation (EC) No 2366/1998 should also be adjusted in order to calculate the production of additional olive trees not eligible for aid during the 2003/04 marketing year.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2768/98\u00a0(4) lays down special terms for implementing the private storage arrangements for olive oil provided for in Article 12a of Regulation 136/66/EEC until 31 October 2004.\n(7) Since that scheme is to continue for the 2004/05 marketing year, the date referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2768/98 should be amended.\n(8) Regulations (EC) Nos 2366/98 and 2768/98 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in the title, \u20182003/04\u2019 is replaced by \u20182004/05\u2019;\n2.
