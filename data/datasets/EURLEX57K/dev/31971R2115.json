whereas these measures relate to trade with third countries ; whereas they will no longer apply when the disturbance or threat of disturbance has ceased;\nWhereas it is for the Council to adopt detailed rules for the application of Article 21 (1) of that Regulation and define the cases in which and the limits within which Member States may take interim protective measures;\nWhereas, therefore, the main factors to be used in assessing whether the Community market is seriously disturbed or threatened with disturbance should be determined;\nWhereas, since recourse to protective measures depends on the effect of trade with third countries on the Community market, the situation on this market must be assessed by taking account not only of the factors peculiar to the market itself but also of the factors connected with the development of that trade;\nWhereas the measures which may be taken in application of Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 should be laid down ; whereas those measures must be such as to put an end to serious disturbances on the market and the threat of such disturbances ; whereas they must be suited to the circumstances if they are not to have other than the desired effects;\nWhereas the organisation of the market in milk and milk products includes a system of import licences and for certain products a system of advance fixing of refunds and a system of export licences ; whereas in view of the existence of these systems rules should he laid down whereby interim protective measures at Community level can be decided upon after a summary examination of the situation;\nWhereas recourse by a Member State to Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 should be limited to cases in which the market of that State, following an assessment based on the above-mentioned factors, is regarded as fulfilling the conditions of that Article ; whereas the measures which may be taken in that case should be designed to prevent the market situation from deteriorating further ; whereas, however, they must be of an interim nature ; whereas this interim nature of national measures justifies their application only until the entry into force of a Community decision on the subject;\nWhereas the Commission is required to take a decision on Community protective measures to be applied in response to a Member State within twenty-four hours following receipt of the request ; whereas, in order that the Commission may assess the situation on the market correctly, provision should be made to ensure that it is informed as quickly as possible of any interim protective measures by a Member State ; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for the Commission to be notified of  1OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 13. 2OJ No L 148, 3.7.1971, p. 3.\nany such measures as soon as they have been adopted and for such notification to be treated as a request within the meaning of Article 21 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68;", "main_body": ["In order to assess whether the Community market in one or more of the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 is, by reason of imports or exports, experiencing or threatened with serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, particular account shall be taken of:    (a) the quantities of products for which import licences have been issued or applied for;\n(b) the volume of actual or foreseeable exports and the quantities for which export licences have been issued or applied for;\n(c) the quantities of products available on the Community market;\n(d) the prices recorded on the Community market or the foreseeable trend of these prices and in particular any excessive upward trend or, in the case of products for which no intervention price has been fixed, any excessive downward or upward trend;\n(e) the quantities of products for which intervention measures have been taken or may need to he taken.", "1.

A Member State may take one or more interim protective measures if, after an assessment based on the factors set out in Article 1, it considers that the  situation foreseen in Article 21 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 has arisen in its own territory.\nThe interim protective measures shall consist in:    (a) the total or partial suspension of the issue of import licences;\n(b) the total or partial suspension of the advance fixing of refunds and of the issue of export licences;\n(c) the requirement that the charges referred to in Article 2 (1) (d) be deposited or their amount secured.\nThe measure mentioned in (c) shall involve the levying of charges only if it is so decided in accordance with Article 21 (2) or (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68.\nThe provisions of Article 2 (2) shall apply.\n2.
