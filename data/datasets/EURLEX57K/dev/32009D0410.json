Since those efforts failed, it is necessary to provide for continued financial support under a new supplementary research programme.\n(4) Given the continued need for the HFR as an irreplaceable infrastructure for Community research in the fields of improvement of safety of existing nuclear reactors, of health including the development of medical isotopes to answer questions of medical research, of nuclear fusion, of fundamental research and of training and waste management including the possibility to study the safety behaviour of nuclear fuels for the new generation of reactor systems, its operation should continue under this supplementary research programme until 2011.\n(5) Due to their special interest in the continued operation of the HFR, Belgium, France and the Netherlands should, as indicated by them, finance this programme through financial contributions made to the general budget of the European Union by way of assigned revenue.\n(6) Part of the contributions under the present supplementary programme should also cover expenditure made during the year 2008,", "main_body": ["The supplementary research programme on the operation of the high flux reactor at Petten (HFR), (hereinafter the programme), the objectives of which are set out in Annex I, is adopted for a period of three years, starting on 1 January 2009.", "The financial contribution estimated as necessary for the execution of the programme amounts to EUR\u00a034,992 million.

To ensure the safe and reliable operation of the high flux reactor at Petten (HFR), in order to guarantee the availability of the neutron flux for experimental purposes.\n2. To allow an efficient use of HFR by research institutes in a broad range of disciplines: improvement of safety of existing nuclear reactors, health including the development of medical isotopes to answer questions of medical research, nuclear fusion, fundamental research and training and waste management including the possibility to study the safety behaviour of nuclear fuels for the new generation of reactor systems.\nANNEX II\nBREAKDOWN OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe contributions to the programme come from Belgium, France and the Netherlands.\nThe breakdown of those contributions is as follows:\nBelgium: EUR 1,2 million\nFrance: EUR 0,9 million\nThe Netherlands: EUR 32,892 million\nTotal: EUR 34,992 million.\nThose contributions shall be made to the general budget of the European Union and shall be assigned to this programme. Part of the contributions under the present supplementary programme may also cover expenditure made to the operation of the HFR during the year 2008 in accordance with the work programme to be agreed upon among contributing countries and the Commission.\nThose contributions are fixed and not revisable as regards the operational and maintenance cost variations."}
