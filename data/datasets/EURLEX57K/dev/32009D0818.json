Hence the risk remains that the disease may spread from third countries to the Member States.\n(5) Therefore, apart from limiting the direct risk caused by imports of poultry, poultry products and pet birds, it is appropriate to keep in place the biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and to keep in place the early detection systems in areas at particular risk.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to continue to keep in place the measures laid down in Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/731/EC, 2005/734/EC and 2007/25/EC in order to reduce the risk of the transmission of that disease.\n(7) The period of application of those Decisions should therefore be extended until 31 December 2010.\n(8) Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/731/EC, 2005/734/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 7 of Decision 2005/692/EC, the date \u201831 December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "In Article 4 of Decision 2005/731/EC, the date \u201831 December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "In Article 4 of Decision 2005/734/EC, the date \u201831 December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "In Article 6 of Decision 2007/25/EC, the date \u201831 December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
