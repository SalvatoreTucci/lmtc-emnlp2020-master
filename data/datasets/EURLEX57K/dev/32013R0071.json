It also establishes lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof which fulfill certain criteria and from which therefore consignments may be introduced into the Union.\n(2) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 authorises the imports of fresh deboned and matured bovine meat from the whole territory of Uruguay.\n(3) Uruguay is free of foot and mouth disease but practices vaccination. It has thus a general health status for bovine animals different from that of the Union. As a result Uruguay is only allowed to export fresh deboned and matured meat of bovine animals. The import requirements provide that the bovine animals intended for slaughter for export of fresh meat to the Union are sent directly from the holding of origin to the slaughterhouse. This rule excludes many small holdings from producing for the Union market as their animals always pass through assembly centres or animal markets before slaughter.\n(4) A Union audit in March 2012 confirmed that Uruguay\u2019s identification and movement registration system allows certifying veterinarians to verify the prior whereabouts of the animals. The system thus ensures that animals have stayed 40 days on one holding before transport to the slaughterhouse. Uruguay can also guarantee that the Union animal health import requirements for bovine animals destined for slaughter for export of fresh deboned and matured bovine meat to the Union are respected even if those animals pass through assembly centres and/or markets prior to slaughter due to a system that identifies all bovine animals individually so that they can be traced back to their origin.\n(5) Uruguay thus offers guarantees sufficient to ensure that all bovine animals whose meat is destined for export to the Union have the same health status when passing through an assembly centre (including markets) in Uruguay prior to slaughter. Therefore, the entry corresponding to this country in the list in Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should be adapted.\n(6) An error appeared in two references to footnotes contained in Part II.2 of the model certificate \u2018OVI-X\u2019 set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010. Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amending provisions\nIn Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, the row relating to Uruguay is replaced by the following:\nISO code and name of third country Code of Territory Description of third country, territory or part thereof Veterinary certificate Specific conditions Closing date(2) Opening date(3)\nModel(s) SG\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\u2018UY \u2013 Uruguay UY-0 Whole country EQU\nBOV A and J 1  1 November 2001\u2019\nOVI A 1", "Correcting provisions\nIn Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, Part II of the model certificate \u2018OVI-X\u2019, is corrected as follows:\n(a) in point II.2.8, the phrase:\n\u2018(1)\neither [II.2.8.2. are animals intended for production born in and continuously reared on holdings in which a case of scrapie has never been diagnosed;]\u2019\n\u2018(2)either [II.2.8.2. are animals intended for production born in and continuously reared on holdings in which a case of scrapie has never been diagnosed;]\u2019\n(b) in point II.2.9, the introductory phrase:", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 January 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004; p. 321.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 20.3.2010, p. 1."}
