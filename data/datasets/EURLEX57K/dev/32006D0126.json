In letters dated 27 October 2005, 7 September 2005 and 25 October 2005, the Commission respectively notified the Netherlands, Spain and Italy that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of their individual requests.\n(6) Decision 98/161/EC authorised the Netherlands to apply, until 31\u00a0December 1999, certain measures to prevent evasion connected with the supply and intra-community acquisition of used and waste materials. Council Decision 2000/435/EC\u00a0(5) extended the expiry date of Decision 98/161/EC until 31 December 2003. It was subsequently followed by Council Decision 2004/514/EC\u00a0(6), which further extended the authorisation given under Decision 98/161/EC until the earlier of the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector or 31 December 2005.\n(7) Decision 2004/228/EC authorised Spain to apply a measure to prevent evasion of VAT in the waste recycling sector. The said Decision expires on the earlier of the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector or 31 December 2005.\n(8) Decision 2004/295/EC authorised Italy to apply a measure to prevent evasion of VAT in the waste recycling sector. The said Decision expires on the earlier of the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector or 31 December 2005.\n(9) The measures are proportionate to the objectives pursued since they are intended to apply to specific supplies which pose considerable risks of tax evasion.\n(10) The matters of law and of fact which justified the application of the special measures in question have not been changed and still pertain. However, on 16 March 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards certain measures to simplify the procedure for charging value added tax and to assist in countering tax evasion and avoidance, and repealing certain Decisions granting derogations. The proposed Directive would, if adopted, empower Member States to designate the recipient of certain goods and services in the waste sector as the person liable to pay the tax.\n(11) Consequently, it is necessary to extend the application of Decisions 98/161/EC, 2004/228/EC and 2004/295/EC, until 31 December 2009 or until the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector amending Directive 77/388/EEC, whichever is the earlier.\n(12) The extension of the derogation has no adverse impact on the Communities\u2019 own resources accruing from VAT, nor does it have any effect on the amount of VAT charged at the final stage of consumption.\n(13) In order to ensure legal continuity, this Decision should apply as from 1 January 2006,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Decision 98/161/EC, \u201831 December 2005\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "In Article 3 of Decision 2004/228/EC, \u201831 December 2005\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "In Article 3 of Decision 2004/295/EC, \u201831 December 2005\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply as from 1 January 2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain, the Italian Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 February 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.-H.
