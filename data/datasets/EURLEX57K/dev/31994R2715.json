Member States shall set rules for determining whether an area is irrigated in the course of a crop year. Those rules shall include:\n- the drawing-up of a list of arable crops for which compensatory payment at the irrigated yield rate may be granted,\n- a description of the irrigation equipment that the farmer must hold; this must be commensurate with the area concerned and allow for the supply of sufficient water to ensure the normal development of the plant during its growing cycle,\n- the fixing of the irrigation period to be taken into account.\n2. In the 'area' aid applications, producers shall separate irrigated and non-irrigated areas. Member States shall check that applications for irrigated payment satisfy the rules set out in paragraph 1. Should they not do so, the penalties laid down in  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 (5) shall be applied according to the area concerned.", "In regions where this Regulation applies:\n(a) the question as to whether a producer qualifies as a 'small producer' within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 shall be determined on the basis of the content of his 'area' application as a whole and of the irrigated and  non-irrigated yields;\n(b) compensatory payments for arable crops under the general or the simplified scheme shall be made on the basis of the irrigated yield for the corresponding areas, and of the non-irrigated yield for other areas;\n(c) compensatory payments for set-aside land shall be made on the basis of,\n- the average yield for the region, for the marketing year 1994/95,\n- the non-irrigated yield for the region, for the marketing year 1995/96 and thereafter.", "For the 1994/95 marketing year the compensatory payments on the basis of the 'irrigated' yield shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 8 of this Regulation. Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, save for the  fifth subparagraph thereof, shall not apply for the 1994/95 marketing year.", "(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 shall not apply for the 1994/95 marketing year in so far as any increase in the average yield results from the indication of newly irrigated areas in the ceiling referred to in the fifth subparagraph of", "(1) of that Regulation.", "1. If the area for which compensatory payment is sought on the basis of a specific irrigated yield exceeds the ceiling set out in the Annex, the compensatory payments at the rate for the irrigated yield shall be proportionately reduced for  the region in question.\n2. Should both the ceiling as set out in the Annex and a base area as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 be exceeded on the same occasion, only the higher of the two reductions provided for shall be made.", "Regulation (EEC) No 1113/93 is hereby repealed.", "0\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall be applicable from the 1994/95 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u00e9 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 181, 1. 7. 1992, p. 12.\n(2) OJ No L 106, 27. 4. 1994, p. 14.\n(3) OJ No L 30, 3. 2. 1994, p. 2.\n(4) OJ No L 113, 7. 5. 1993, p. 14.\n(5) OJ No L 391, 31. 12. 1992, p. 36.\nANNEX\nGREECE\n\"(in hectares)\"\" ID=\"1\">Zone I> ID=\"2\">218 002\"> ID=\"1\">Zone II> ID=\"2\">4 057\">\nFRANCE\n\"(in hectares)\"\" ID=\"1\">Ain> ID=\"2\">16 615> ID=\"5\">5 000\"> ID=\"1\">Aisne> ID=\"2\">750> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Allier A> ID=\"2\">5 155> ID=\"5\">283\"> ID=\"1\">Allier B> ID=\"2\">6 333> ID=\"5\">419\"> ID=\"1\">Alpes-de-Haute-Provence> ID=\"2\">7 223> ID=\"5\">1  117\"> ID=\"1\">Ard\u00e8che> ID=\"2\">2 830> ID=\"5\">123\"> ID=\"1\">Ari\u00e8ge> ID=\"2\">14 926> ID=\"5\">2 176\"> ID=\"1\">Aude A> ID=\"2\">9 032> ID=\"5\">1 797\"> ID=\"1\">Aude B> ID=\"2\">784> ID=\"5\">50\"> ID=\"1\">Aveyron> ID=\"2\">5 193> ID=\"5\">10\"> ID=\"1\">Cantal> ID=\"2\">1 397>  ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Charente> ID=\"2\">28 874> ID=\"5\">55\"> ID=\"1\">Charente-Maritime> ID=\"2\">69 973> ID=\"5\">30\"> ID=\"1\">Cher> ID=\"2\">25 944> ID=\"5\">287\"> ID=\"1\">C\u00f4te-d'Or> ID=\"2\">1 200> ID=\"5\">1 200\"> ID=\"1\">Dr\u00f4me> ID=\"2\">24 946> ID=\"5\">1 600\">  ID=\"1\">Eure-et-Loir> ID=\"2\">50 293> ID=\"5\">367\"> ID=\"1\">Gard> ID=\"2\">1 539> ID=\"5\">193\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Garonne> ID=\"2\">54 883> ID=\"5\">8 550\"> ID=\"1\">Gers> ID=\"2\">76 526> ID=\"5\">9 500\"> ID=\"1\">H\u00e9rault> ID=\"2\">1 850> ID=\"5\">112\"> ID=\"1\">Indre>  ID=\"2\">16 287> ID=\"5\">113\"> ID=\"1\">Indre-et-Loire> ID=\"2\">17 291> ID=\"5\">175\"> ID=\"1\">Is\u00e8re> ID=\"2\">16 043> ID=\"5\">1 400\"> ID=\"1\">Jura B> ID=\"2\">3 818> ID=\"5\">543\"> ID=\"1\">Loir-et-Cher> ID=\"2\">25 905> ID=\"5\">150\"> ID=\"1\">Loire> ID=\"2\">7 496>  ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Loire A> ID=\"2\">520> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Loire B> ID=\"2\">449> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Loire C> ID=\"2\">100> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Loire-Atlantique> ID=\"2\">8 078> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Loiret> ID=\"2\">48 009> ID=\"5\">342\">  ID=\"1\">Lot A> ID=\"2\">1 919> ID=\"5\">178\"> ID=\"1\">Lot B> ID=\"2\">5 801> ID=\"5\">137\"> ID=\"1\">Lot-et-Garonne> ID=\"2\">59 685> ID=\"5\">7 200\"> ID=\"1\">Maine-et-Loire> ID=\"2\">27 597> ID=\"5\">218\"> ID=\"1\">Mayenne> ID=\"2\">2 490> ID=\"5\">9\"> ID=\"1\">Ni\u00e8vre>  ID=\"2\">6 066> ID=\"5\">400\"> ID=\"1\">Puy-de-D\u00f4me A> ID=\"2\">6 625> ID=\"5\">100\"> ID=\"1\">Puy-de-D\u00f4me B> ID=\"2\">430> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales> ID=\"2\">254> ID=\"5\">19\"> ID=\"1\">Rh\u00f4ne> ID=\"2\">6 992> ID=\"5\">648\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Sa\u00f4ne> ID=\"2\">977>  ID=\"5\">977\"> ID=\"1\">Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire> ID=\"2\">532> ID=\"5\">136\"> ID=\"1\">Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire> ID=\"2\">2 959> ID=\"5\">757\"> ID=\"1\">Sarthe> ID=\"2\">24 295> ID=\"5\">77\"> ID=\"1\">Haute-Savoie> ID=\"2\">608> ID=\"5\">13\"> ID=\"1\">Seine-et-Marne> ID=\"2\">190> ID=\"5\">190\">  ID=\"1\">Deux-S\u00e8vres> ID=\"2\">26 855> ID=\"5\">69\"> ID=\"1\">Somme> ID=\"2\">250> ID=\"5\">0\"> ID=\"1\">Tarn> ID=\"2\">23 299> ID=\"5\">5 859\"> ID=\"1\">Tarn-et-Garonne> ID=\"2\">43 330> ID=\"5\">6 200\"> ID=\"1\">Var> ID=\"2\">2 072> ID=\"5\">337\"> ID=\"1\">Vend\u00e9e> ID=\"2\">45  875> ID=\"5\">25\"> ID=\"1\">Vienne> ID=\"2\">36 377> ID=\"5\">76\"> ID=\"1\">Vaucluse> ID=\"2\">1 102> ID=\"5\">102\"> ID=\"1\">Yonne> ID=\"2\">3 820> ID=\"5\">320\"> ID=\"1\">Hautes-Alpes> ID=\"2\">80> ID=\"3\">0> ID=\"5\">80\"> ID=\"1\">Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne> ID=\"2\">553> ID=\"3\">0>  ID=\"5\">553\"> ID=\"1\">Dordogne A> ID=\"2\">30 387> ID=\"3\">26 796> ID=\"4\">3 177> ID=\"5\">539\"> ID=\"1\">Gironde A> ID=\"2\">35 738> ID=\"3\">35 400> ID=\"5\">440\"> ID=\"1\">Landes> ID=\"2\">105 475> ID=\"3\">103 318> ID=\"5\">2 805\"> ID=\"1\">Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques>  ID=\"2\">22 150> ID=\"3\">19 608> ID=\"5\">3 306\"> ID=\"1\">Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es> ID=\"2\">30 034> ID=\"3\">28 677> ID=\"5\">1 765\"> ID=\"1\">Bas-Rhin> ID=\"2\">17 373> ID=\"3\">16 835> ID=\"5\">700\"> ID=\"1\">Haut-Rhin> ID=\"2\">41 181> ID=\"3\">39 620> ID=\"5\">2 030\">  ID=\"1\">Savoie> ID=\"2\">375> ID=\"3\">299> ID=\"5\">98\">"}
