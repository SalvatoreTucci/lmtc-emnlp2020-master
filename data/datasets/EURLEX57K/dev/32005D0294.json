The derogation was applicable within the framework of the Danish action programme adopted for the year 1999 to 2003 and valid until 1 August 2004. It allowed the application of livestock manure containing up to 230\u00a0kg of nitrogen per hectare per year on specific cattle holdings.\n(3) On 8 January 2004, Denmark requested an extension of the derogation. This request was completed by technical documents dated 2 February 2004, 2 April 2004, 23 April 2004, 14 June 2004, 2 August 2004, 14 September 2004 and 4 October 2004.\n(4) Danish legislation transposing Directive 91/676/EEC can be considered to be in compliance with Directive and its provisions apply equally to the notified derogation.\n(5) In December 2003 Denmark completed the evaluation of its second Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment which indicated the achievement of the reduction target for nitrate leaching of 48\u00a0% in the period 1985 to 2003.\n(6) The Danish Parliamentary agreement on the third Danish Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment 2005 to 2015 set the objectives for a further reduction of nitrate leaching by 13\u00a0% in the period 2005 to 2015 and for a reduction of the phosphate surplus by 50\u00a0%.\n(7) In conformity with Article 5 of Directive 91/676/EEC, Denmark has set action programmes that will ensure compliance with the objective of a maximum of 50\u00a0mg/l of nitrates in groundwater as set out in that Directive.\n(8) Results of monitoring and controls show that, in period 2002 to 2003, 1\u00a0845 cattle holdings, 213\u00a0617 livestock units and 123\u00a0068 hectares, corresponding respectively to 4\u00a0%, 11\u00a0% and 5\u00a0% of the total in Denmark, were encompassed by the derogation, set in Decision 2002/915/EC.\n(9) Calculations on nitrate leaching based on survey and nutrient analysis in agricultural catchments, in reference sites on sandy and clay soils, show that, in the period 1990 to 2003, nitrate leaching has been reduced by 42\u00a0% in loamy soils and by 52\u00a0% in sandy soils. This reduction is confirmed for 2002/2003.\n(10) Trend analysis of measured nitrate concentration in water leaving the root zones shows that it has decreased steadily and is now approaching 50\u00a0mg/l, with a yearly decrease of 3,1 and 6,1\u00a0mg/l respectively for loamy and sandy soils. Nitrate concentration in streams in agricultural catchments decreased by 29\u00a0% in the period 1990 to 2003. In 2003, nitrate average concentration in upper groundwater was below 50\u00a0mg/l, both in sandy and loamy soils.\n(11) The Commission, after examination of Denmark\u2019s request and, more in particular, in the light of the experience gained from the derogation as provided in Decision 2002/915/EC, considers that the amount of manure envisaged by Denmark, 230\u00a0kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, if certain strict conditions are met.\n(12) This Decision is applicable in connection with the framework of the Danish action programme adopted for the years 2004 to 2007.\n(13) Decision 2002/915/EC expired on 1 August 2004. In view of the experience gained under that Decision and for the purpose of ensuring that the cattle farmers concerned may continue to benefit from derogation, it is appropriate that the present Decision shall apply from 2 August 2004.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["Denmark\u2019s request submitted by letter of 8 January 2004 asking the Commission to allow derogation under point 2(b) of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC is approved, subject to the conditions laid down hereunder.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Cattle farms\u2019 means holdings with more than three livestock units, where at least two-thirds of livestock are cattle,\n(b) \u2018grass\u2019 means permanent or temporary grassland (generally temporary lies less than four years),\n(c) \u2018crops being undersown by grass\u2019: silage cereals, silage maize and/or spring barley, to be undersown before (maize) or after harvest, by grass which will act as a catch crop, for biological retention of nitrogen residual during winter,\n(d) \u2018beets\u2019 means forage beets.", "Scope\nThis derogation applies on an individual basis and under the conditions prescribed in Articles 4 to 6 to cattle farms where the crop rotation includes more than 70\u00a0% of particularly nitrogen consuming crops, with a long growing season.", "Annual authorisation and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cattle farmers shall submit an application for derogation to the competent authorities annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with that annual application, they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.", "Application of manure and other fertilisers\nThe amount of livestock manure applied to the land each year on cattle farms, including by the animals themselves, shall not exceed the amount of manure containing 230\u00a0kg of nitrogen, under the following conditions:\n(a) the total nitrogen inputs must comply with the nutrient demand of the considered crop and the supply from the soil, the fertilisation rate being fixed 10\u00a0% under optimal economic level;\n(b) a fertilisation plan and account must be kept for each farm.

By 21 April such plans covering the whole of the period must be completed with information on expected application of manure and nitrogen fertilisers and must be available to the authorities. Crop rotation plans must specify grass, grass catch crops or beet and other crops being undersown by grass. Fertilisation plans must include the estimated need for nitrogen and phosphorous application, and nitrogen application shall be fixed 10\u00a0% below the economic optimum. It also must specify the nature of fertiliser to be used (e.g. livestock manure, waste products, chemical fertiliser) and contain a sketch map indicating location of individual fields.
