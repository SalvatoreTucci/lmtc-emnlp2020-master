For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 69(6)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the amounts calculated in accordance with Article\u00a069(7) of that Regulation have been laid down in Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01120/2009\u00a0(2). For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the amounts notified by Member States which they intend to use in 2014 in accordance with Article 69(6)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.\n(6) For the sake of clarity, the 2014 budgetary ceilings for the single payment scheme, resulting from deduction of the ceilings established for the payments referred to in Articles 52, 53, 68 and 72a of Regulation (EC) No\u00a073/2009 from the ceilings set out in Annex VIII to that Regulation, should be published. The amount to be deducted from the ceilings set out in that Annex in order to finance the specific support provided for in Article\u00a068 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 corresponds to the difference between the total amount for the specific support notified by the Member States and the amounts notified to finance the specific support in accordance with Article 69(6)(a) of that Regulation. Where a Member State implementing the single payment scheme decides to grant the support referred to in Article 68(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the amount notified to the Commission is to be included in the single payment scheme ceiling, as this support takes the form of an increase in the unit value and/or the number of the farmer's payment entitlements.\n(7) For Member States implementing, in 2014, the single area payment scheme provided for in Chapter 2 of Title V of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the annual financial envelopes should be established in accordance with Article\u00a0123(1) of that Regulation.\n(8) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate sugar payments in 2014 under Article 126 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a073/2009, established on the basis of their notification, should be published.\n(9) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate fruit and vegetables payments in 2014 pursuant to Article 127 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, established on the basis of their notification, should be published.\n(10) For the sake of clarity, the maximum amount of funds available to Member States applying the single area payment scheme for granting separate
