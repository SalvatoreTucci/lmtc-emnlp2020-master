That list includes carbofuran.\n(3) For carbofuran the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those regulations designate the Rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For carbofuran the Rapporteur Member State was Belgium and all relevant information was submitted on 2 August 2004.\n(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group Evaluation and presented to the Commission on 28 July 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbofuran\u00a0(4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 24 November 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for carbofuran.\n(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. The risk assessment for ground water contamination could not be concluded, in particular because the data supplied by the notifier within the legal deadlines did not provide sufficient information about a number of metabolites which have a hazardous profile. Also the consumer risk assessment, which raised a concern about the acute exposure of vulnerable groups of consumers, in particular children, could not be finalised due to the lack of information as regards certain relevant residues. Furthermore, the data supplied by the notifier within the legal deadlines was insufficient to allow the EFSA to assess the ecotoxicological effects of the active substance. As a result, concerns remain as regards the risk assessment for birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, and soil non-target organisms. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that carbofuran met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forwards by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing carbofuran satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(7) Carbofuran should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing carbofuran are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing carbofuran should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.\n(10) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for carbofuran according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Carbofuran shall not be included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that:\n(a) authorisations for plant protection products containing carbofuran are withdrawn by 13 December 2007;\n(b) no authorisations for plant protection products containing carbofuran are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.", "Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 13 December 2008 at the latest.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
