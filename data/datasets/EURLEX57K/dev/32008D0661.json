It provides that Member States are to complete their survey by no later than the end of the 2007 hunting season.\n(5) Based on the preliminary annual reports that the Commission has received to date from the Member States pursuant to Decision 2007/182/EC, it appears that certain Member States have not had sufficient time to achieve their target numbers of samples as required by that Decision.\n(6) In order to allow a statistically robust assessment of the survey data by the EFSA, it is necessary that the Member States concerned are allowed more time to reach the targets set out in Decision 2007/182/EC. It is therefore appropriate to prolong the date for completion of the survey by an additional one-year period.\n(7) Decision 2007/182/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/182/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3(2) the year \u20182007\u2019 is replaced by \u20182008\u2019;\n2. in point 2 of Annex IV the following paragraph is added:", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 August 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.
