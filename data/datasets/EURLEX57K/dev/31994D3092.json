whereas its  importance in this respect can be seen from the fact that the data collected pursuant to the  demonstration project set up by Decision 86/138/EEC (4), are being put to specific uses by several  Member States for the adoption of measures in the area of product safety;\nWhereas Decision 93/683/EEC (5) introduced a system of information on home and leisure accidents  for one year in 1993; whereas the objective of preventing accidents requires a longer period and  whereas a four-year period seems appropriate;\nWhereas national policies on protection of the health and safety of consumers as well as on  prevention of home and leisure accidents are already being implemented in all the Member States;  whereas, however, it is necessary, due to the increasing circulation of products in the framework  of the internal market, to provide for specific action in order to allow, in this internal market,  identification of the products involved in accidents and the combination of circumstances which  might lead to these accidents; whereas, for this purpose, it is desirable for national authorities  to have sufficiently homogeneous instruments so that the conclusions of one Member State can, where  appropriate, be used in other Member States as well as at Community level;\nWhereas, although the management of consumer safety is primarily the responsibility of each Member  State, Community financial involvement can help the Member States to overcome the problems of the  actual collection of data at national level; whereas the Commission must therefore provide  coordination and contribute to the homogeneous implementation of action taken at national level, by  promoting the dissemination of information on home and leisure accidents to all the competent  authorities;\nWhereas a Community framework and Community financial assistance are necessary to avoid major  distortions, since a number of Member States would not have the necessary resources to obtain by  themselves the data on home and leisure accidents which help to establish a policy on consumer  protection;\nWhereas steps should be taken to ensure the overall quality of the data and, in the context of the  internal market and Council Directive 92/59/EEC of 29 June 1992 on general product safety (1), to  make it possible for all Member States to collect the information needed for the monitoring of the  products involved in accidents; whereas such data must be obtained from hospital casualty  departments, or alternative sources suffering equal guarantees of reliability of the data;\nWhereas the Community aspects of the collection of data oblige the Member States to use a  homogeneous methodology for the collection and production of information for transmission to the  Commission; whereas this constraint is not disproportionate to the objective pursued; whereas by  its very nature, this system is not appropriate to serve as statistical proof, a fact which should  be pointed out each time the system is referred to;\nWhereas the Commission will, for the application of this Decision, use the Committee provided for  in Article 10 (1) of Directive 92/59/EEC for the purpose of assisting the Commission in defining  the technical aspects in connection with the implementation and the improvement of the system;\nWhereas the provision of specific information by the Member States, at the Commission's request, on  products or groups of products involved in accidents is necessary for the development of a  Community policy on product safety;\nWhereas the Member States must also be in a position to make annual summary reports to the  Commission; whereas the conclusions drawn by the Member States in those reports should make it  possible for the Commission, in concert with the Member States, to determine what action should be  taken at Community level;\nWhereas, finally, the introduction of an information system on home and leisure accidents appears,  under these conditions, to be necessary at Community level to support and complement the policy  carried out by the Member States in this important area to achieve a high level of consumer  protection and it does not exceed what is necessary to promote the prevention of such accidents; it  is therefore consonant with the principle of subsidiarity,", "main_body": ["1.  A Community system of information on home and leisure accidents,  hereinafter referred to as 'the system`, is hereby set up for the period 1994 to 1997. The  specifications and operating procedures of the system are defined in Annex I.\n2.  The system's objective should be to collect data on home and leisure accidents with a view to  promoting accident prevention, improving the safety of consumer products and informing and  educating consumers so that they make better use of products, at both national and Community  level.\n3.  This Decision shall not apply to occupational accidents and illness, nor to road, rail, sea or  air traffic accidents.", "1.  Member States shall be responsible for implementing the system. They shall process  directly the data collected and submit to the Commission annual reports containing summaries and  evaluations at national level of the results obtained and the conclusions they draw from those  results. These reports must be forwarded at the latest at the end of the fourth month of the year  following the year in question.\n2.  The Community financial support provided for in Article 3 (2) shall be tied to the submission  of the annual report referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.  Member States shall supply the Commission, at its request with the data available on the safety  of certain products or categories of product involved in home and leisure accidents and the  circumstances surrounding such accidents.\n4.  Member States shall designate the authority or authorities responsible for the collection and  transmission of the data and shall inform the Commission of the names and addresses of those  authorities. The Commission shall forward that information to all Member States with a view to  facilitating direct exchanges of information between national authorities.\n5.  In the interests of transparency in the use of Community funds, each Member State shall ensure  appropriate publication of the report referred to in paragraph 1.", "1.  To improve the compatibility of the methodologies used, the Commission shall, in  accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 7, at the latest by the end of the first year of  the system's functioning, and on the basis of previous experience, draw up new rules designed to  bring about greater uniformity of codes, definitions, classification of data and presentation of  national reports. To this end the Commission shall, in particular, take into account the codes and  models already existing at international or Community level.\n2.  The Commission shall help finance implementation of the system in the Member States, in  accordance with the detailed rules laid down in Annex II.\n3.  The Commission shall process, summarize and publish each year the data received from the Member  States and shall disseminate them in an appropriate manner at Community level, in particular to the  Consumer Consultative Council, to European or national consumer associations, to European consumer  information centres and to European standardization bodies. This information will be directly  accessible to consumers by means of the network for the exchange of information on the rights of  consumers in the Community. The Commission shall also undertake information campaigns, in so far as  they are necessary at Community level.", "1.  The Commission and the Member States shall ensure that, in the course of the  collection and forwarding of information, all identifying details or those which enable identities  to be deduced are removed so that the identity of victims remains confidential.\n2.  Any referenced use of data in the Member States in official publications shall be accompanied  by a statement to the effect that the Community system of information on home and leisure accidents  provides only general indications and cannot be regarded as statistical proof of the safety or lack  of safety of a given product.", "The Community financial resources deemed necessary for implementing the system shall be  ECU 2,5 million per year for the period 1994 to 1997.\nThe amount shall fall within the current financial perspective.\nThe budget authority shall determine the appropriations available for each financial year taking  into account the principles of sound management referred to in Article 2 of the Financial  Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.", "1.  At the beginning of 1995 the Commission shall draw up a report, together with any  appropriate proposals for amendments, including those concerning the distribution among the Member  States, from 1 January 1996, of hospitals participating in the system so as to make the  representativity of the sample homogeneous.\n2.  At the beginning of 1996 the Commission shall draw up a more general assessment report on the  operation of the system, together with any proposals for amendments, where appropriate, to the  arrangements for the allocation of financial support.\n3.  By 31 December 1997 at the latest the Commission shall draw up a final report on the  implementation and effectiveness of the system.\n4.  In drawing up its reports, the Commission shall take due account of experience gained from  previous assessments and pay particular attention to the following:\n- the timeliness, quality and comparability of the data provided by the Member States,\n- the need to adjust existing codes and to adopt new codes and common coding principles in view of  the increasing number of new products,\n- ease of access to information,\n- the enhanced value of the data to the Member States and the Community.\nThe reports shall be submitted to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social  Committee.", "1.  The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee set up by Article 10 (1) of  Directive 92/59/EEC.\n2.  The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to  be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the  Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter, if necessary by taking a vote.\nThe opinion shall be recorded in the minutes; in addition, each Member State shall have the right  to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes.\nThe Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the Committee. It shall  inform the Committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account.\n3.  The Committee may, at the request of the Commission or a Member State, examine any issue linked  with the application of this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official  Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 1994.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 1994.\nFor the European Parliament The President K.
