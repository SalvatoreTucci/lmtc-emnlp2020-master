The additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to that Directive may be authorised without a time limit subject to certain conditions being satisfied.\n(2) The use of the enzyme preparation of 6-phytase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 11857) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1353/2000\u00a0(2), and for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 261/2003\u00a0(3).\n(3) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of that preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC for such an authorisation have been satisfied.\n(4) Accordingly, the use of that preparation, under the conditions set out in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additive set out in the Annex. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(4).\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as set out in the Annex, is authorised for use without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
