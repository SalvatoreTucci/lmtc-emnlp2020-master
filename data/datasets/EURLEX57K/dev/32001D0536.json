Moreover it becomes apparent that Pepino mosaic virus is present in several non-member countries.\n(4) Pepino mosaic virus is currently not listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. However, a preliminary pest risk analysis carried out by several Member States based on available scientific information has demonstrated that Pepino mosaic virus and its damaging effects could be of significant plant health concern to the Community, in particular for protected tomato production. The risk to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops, especially potatoes, has not yet fully been established. The relevant services in the Member States have been asked by the Commission to continue scientific work and to deliver an opinion on the risk of Pepino mosaic virus to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops. At this stage, the scientific work performed on the Pepino mosaic virus has not provided sufficient clarification to revise that preliminary pest risk analysis.\n(5) Since Decision 2000/325/EC has expired, it is necessary to provide for provisional measures against Pepino mosaic virus.\n(6) The source of contamination on premises involved in tomato fruit production has not been identified so far. The relevant services in Member States are therefore asked by the Commission in order to back the sources of contamination as well as the pathway of introduction.\n(7) Although the role of tomato seed as source of infection is not yet fully clarified, it is likely that seed plays an important role; consequently the measures should also apply to these tomato seeds.\n(8) Those measures should apply to the introduction on the spread of Pepino mosaic virus, the inspection of tomato plants intended for planting originating in non-member countries and the movement of tomato plants intended for planting. They should also include more general monitoring for the presence of Pepino mosaic virus in the Member States.\n(9) The results of the above measures will be continually assessed, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by the Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment, of information to be provided and of the scientific opinion delivered by the relevant services of the Member States.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The introduction into and movement within the Community of plants of tomato, Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.) Karsten ex Farw., intended for planting, shall be banned when they are contaminated by Pepino mosaic virus.", "Plants of tomato, intended for planting, originating in non-member countrties, shall meet the conditions laid down in points 1 or 2 of the Annex to this Decision, and shall be inspected on entry into the Community for the presence of Pepino mosaic virus, in accordance with Article 13(1)(a) of Directive 2000/29/EC, mutatis mutandis.", "1.
