Reporting under the new regime begins with data for January 2003. Reporting obligations under Regulation ECB/1998/16 should therefore have continued to exist until 1 January 2003. However, the date of entry into force of Regulation ECB/2001/13 was erroneously set as 1 January 2002, with the result that Regulation ECB/1998/16, which under the provisions of Regulation ECB/2001/13 is repealed at the date of entry into force of the latter, was repealed one year too soon. Regulation ECB/2001/13 therefore has to be corrected to make clear that it enters into force on 1 January 2003.\n(2) Reporting agents have been subject to the reporting requirements laid down in Regulation ECB/1998/16 since 1 January 1999. The continued application of the latter Regulation until 31 December 2002, in particular, the obligation to comply with it from 1 January 2002, i.e. before the date at which the present regulation enters into force, is considered not to infringe any legitimate expectations of the reporting agents, which continued to report the relevant statistical information after the end of 2001,", "main_body": ["Regulation ECB/2001/13 is corrected as follows:\n- Article 8(1) is replaced by the following: \"1.
