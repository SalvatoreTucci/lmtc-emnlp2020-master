Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Denmark\u2019s total VAT own resources base. Denmark is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for these categories of transactions. Denmark should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resource base using approximate estimates in accordance with the second indent of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89.\n(4) For reasons of transparency and legal certainty it is appropriate to limit the applicability of the authorisation in time.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Own Resources,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base from 1 January 2012, Denmark is authorised to use approximate estimates in respect of the following categories of transactions referred to in Annex X to Directive 2006/112/EC:\n(1) Activities of public radio and television bodies other than those of a commercial nature (Part A, point 2);\n(2) Transport of passengers (Part B, point 10).", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJanusz LEWANDOWSKI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 7.6.1989, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1."}
