(2) OJ No L 202, 6.9.1971, p. 21. (3) OJ No L 104, 18.4.1978, p. 26.\nANNEX\nI.B. 3.2.3. When not connected to a detachable additional device, the exposed ends of the drive shafts must be suitably protected.\nI.B. 8. Location of verification marks and seals    8.1. The location of the marks and seals must be so chosen that dismantling of the part sealed by one of the marks or seals will result in damage thereto.\n8.2. When the inscriptions mentioned in item I.B. 4.1 are affixed on a special data plate, and if this plate is not to be a permanent fixture, one of the marks or seals must be so located that it is damaged if the special plate is removed, the object being to prevent removal of the said plate.\n8.3. Locations should be provided for verification marks or seals:      (a) on all plates carrying an inscription required by this Annex with the exception of plates which are permanent fixtures;\n(b) on all parts of the meter which cannot otherwise be protected against interference liable to:        - affect or alter the indication on the indicating device of the meter,\n- alter or break the connection between the measuring device and the indicating device,\n- remove or displace metrologically important parts of the meter;\n(c) on the connection with the detachable additional devices or on the protective devices referred to in item I.B. 3.2.3.\nI.B. 9.2.1. Gas meters submitted for EEC initial verification shall be in working order. EEC initial verification is no guarantee of the proper functioning or accuracy of reading of additional devices as referred to in items I.B. 3.1 or I.B. 3.2. No EEC verification marks or EEC seals shall be affixed to such additional devices, save for the connections provided for in Item I.B. 8.3. c.\nI.B. 10. Verification marks and seals    10.1. Affixture\nMeters having undergone successfully the verification tests:      - shall be provided with an EEC initial verification mark,\n- shall receive EEC seals in the locations mentioned in item I.B. 8.3.\n10.2. Purpose\nThe affixing of EEC initial verification marks and seals on a gas meter certifies solely that the meter satisfies the requirements of this Directive.\nII. 5.2.1. When the maximum torques indicated on the gas meter pursuant to item I.B. 3.2.1 or I.B. 3.2.2 are applied to the drive shafts, the indication of the gas meter at Qmin must not vary by more than 1 75 %, without prejudice to item II. 6.3.2.\nIII. 3.1.1. Meters must incorporate both upstream and downstream in the gas circuit a static pressure tapping for measuring the pressure absorption ; the pressure measured upstream shall constitute the reference pressure.\nIII. 3.3. Pressure tappings    3.3.1. Bores for pressure tappings must have a diameter of at least 3 mm. In the case of slit-shaped pressure tappings, slits must have a width of at least 2 mm and a cross-section in the direction of flow of at least 10 mm2.\n3.3.2. Pressure tappings must be provided with a means of closure so as to make them gas-tight.\n3.3.3. The pressure tapping for the reference pressure must be clearly and indelibly marked \"pr\" and the other pressure tapping \"p\".\nIII. 7.1. Accuracy tests\nA meter is considered to satisfy the requirements concerning the maximum permissible errors if the requirements are met at the following flow rates:\nQmin, 0 710 Qmax (if this value is greater than Qmin), 0 725 Qmax, 0 740 Qmax, 0 770 Qmax and Qmax.\nIf the examination is conducted under different conditions, the guarantees must be at least equal to those obtained by the tests mentioned above."}
