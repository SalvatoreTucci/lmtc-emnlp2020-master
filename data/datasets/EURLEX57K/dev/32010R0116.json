Some unsaturated fats such as omega-3 fatty acids are sometimes consumed at a level lower than recommended. Therefore, nutrition claims identifying foods being source of these nutrients, or being rich in these nutrients could help consumers to make healthier choices. However, those nutrition claims were not included in the list established in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, as adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, as their conditions of use could not yet be clearly defined.\n(5) Those conditions of use having been clarified, taking also into account an opinion of the Authority on labelling reference intake values for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids adopted on 30 June 2009\u00a0(3), it is, therefore, advisable to include the claims concerned in the list.\n(6) Concerning the claims \u2018Source of omega-3 fatty acids\u2019 and \u2018High in omega-3 fatty acids\u2019, the conditions of use should distinguish between the two types of omega-3 fatty acids, which have different physiological roles and for which different levels of consumption are recommended. Furthermore, those conditions of use should establish a minimum quantity requested per 100\u00a0g and 100\u00a0kcal of product in order to ensure that only foods providing a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids at their level of consumption can bear those claims.\n(7) Concerning the claims \u2018High in monounsaturated fat\u2019, \u2018High in polyunsaturated fat\u2019 and \u2018High in unsaturated fat\u2019, the conditions of use should require a minimum unsaturated fat content in the food, and, consequently, ensure that the claimed amount always corresponds to a significant amount at the level of consumption attainable through a balanced diet.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2005) 253, 1-29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1176, 1-11.\nANNEX\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the following text is added:\n\u2018SOURCE OF OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\nA claim that a food is a source of omega-3 fatty acids, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product contains at least 0,3\u00a0g alpha-linolenic acid per 100\u00a0g and per 100\u00a0kcal, or at least 40\u00a0mg of the sum of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid per 100\u00a0g and per 100\u00a0kcal.\nHIGH OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\nA claim that a food is high in omega-3 fatty acids, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product contains at least 0,6\u00a0g alpha-linolenic acid per 100\u00a0g and per 100\u00a0kcal, or at least 80\u00a0mg of the sum of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid per 100\u00a0g and per 100\u00a0kcal.\nHIGH MONOUNSATURATED FAT\nA claim that a food is high in monounsaturated fat, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where at least 45\u00a0% of the fatty acids present in the product derive from monounsaturated fat under the condition that monounsaturated fat provides more than 20\u00a0% of energy of the product.\nHIGH POLYUNSATURATED FAT\nA claim that a food is high in polyunsaturated fat, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where at least 45\u00a0% of the fatty acids present in the product derive from polyunsaturated fat under the condition that polyunsaturated fat provides more than 20\u00a0% of energy of the product.\nHIGH UNSATURATED FAT\nA claim that a food is high in unsaturated fat, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer may only be made where at least 70\u00a0% of the fatty acids present in the product derive from unsaturated fat under the condition that unsaturated fat provides more than 20\u00a0% of energy of the product.\u2019"}
