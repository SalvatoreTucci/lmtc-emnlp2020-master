Article 2 (1) shall be replaced by the following:\n'1. For the purposes of this Regulation, \"pig carcase\" shall mean the body of a slaughtered pig, bled and eviscerated, whole or divided down the mid-line, without tongue, bristles, hooves, genital organs, flare fat, kidneys and diaphragm.\nWith regard to pigs slaughtered in their territory, the Member States may be authorized to provide for a different presentation of pig carcases if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n- if normal commercial practice in their territory differs from the standard presentation defined in the first subparagraph,\n- if technical requirements warrant it,\n- if pig carcases are dehided in a uniform manner.';\n2. in Article 2 (3), the first subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\n'3. For the purposes of this Regulation, the lean-meat content of a pig carcase shall be the relationship between:\n- the total weight of the red striated muscles provided that they are separable by knife, and\n- the weight of the carcase.\nThe total weight of the red striated muscles is obtained either by total dissection of the carcase or by partial dissection of the carcase or by a combination of total or partial dissection based on proven statistical methods adopted in accordance with  the procedure laid down in Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75.';\n3. the following shall be added after Article 3 (1), first subparagraph:\n'In respect of pigs slaughtered in their territory, Member States may be authorized to allow classification before weighing, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2795/75.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1994.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 1993.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
