It is therefore necessary to extend the duration of the temporary experiment.\n(3) Since the beginning of the temporary experiment and as a result of research and development projects, several other species are now being studied and considered of interest in future mixtures. The species Lathyrus cicera, Medicago doliata and Trifolium isthmocarpum should therefore be included in the scope of the experiment.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Decision 2009/109/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 9 the words \u201831 May 2014\u2019 are replaced by \u201831 May 2016\u2019;\n(3) in Annex I the following entries shall be added to the table:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\u2018Lathyrus cicera 80 95 1,0 (c) (d) (e) 25 1\u00a0000\nMedicago doliata 70 98 2,0 (c) (d) (e) 10 100\nTrifolium isthmocarpum 70 (including hard seeds) 98 1,0 (c) (d) (e) 10 100\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p.\u00a02298/66.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2009/109/EC of 9 February 2009 on the organisation of a temporary experiment providing for certain derogations for the marketing of seed mixtures intended for use as fodder plants pursuant to Council Directive 66/401/EEC to determine whether certain species not listed in Council Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/55/EC or 2002/57/EC fulfil the requirements for being included in Article 2(1)(A) of Directive 66/401/EEC (OJ L\u00a040, 11.2.2009, p.\u00a026).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed (OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p.\u00a02309/66).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2002/55/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of vegetable seed (OJ L 193, 20.7.2002, p.\u00a033).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (OJ L 193, 20.7.2002, p.\u00a074)."}
