whereas such adjustments, directed principally at  increasing the flexibility of the market-support instruments, require the operators concerned to change their economic behaviour to take better account of the actual market situation;\nWhereas inter-branch organizations established by individuals or groups, and representing a significant proportion of the various categories involved in production, processing and marketing in the tobacco sector are likely to contribute to better  account being taken of the market situation and encourage changes in economic behaviour intended to improve knowledge and organization of production, processing and marketing; whereas some of their activities may contribute to improving market balance  and so help achieve the objectives in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas the measures which may constitute such a contribution by the inter-branch organizations should be defined;\nWhereas in view of the above, it appears appropriate to grant specific recognition to bodies which can demonstrate their proven representativeness at regional, inter-regional or Community level and which take positive action in pursuit of the objectives  mentioned above; whereas such recognition should be granted by the Member State or by the Commission depending on the scope of the activities of the trade association;\nWhereas to support certain activities of inter-branch organizations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organization for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an  inter-branch organization for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions; whereas non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to  cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities; whereas this procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer;\nWhereas other activities of the recognized inter-branch organizations may be of general economic or technical interest for the tobacco sector and so be of benefit to all persons active in the branches in question, whether or not they are members of the  organization; whereas in such cases it appears reasonable to make non-members liable to pay the subscriptions intended to cover the costs, other than administrative costs, arising directly from performance of the activities in question;\nWhereas, in order to ensure correct operation of the scheme, there should be close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which should also have permanent monitoring powers, particularly as regards recognition of inter-branch  organizations operating at regional or inter-regional level and the agreements and concerted practices adopted by such organizations;\nWhereas there should be provision for publication, at the beginning of each year, of a list of the organizations recognized during the previous year, a list of the organizations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules  which have been extended with an indication of their scope, for the information of the Member States and other interested parties,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down the conditions for the recognition and activity of inter-branch organizations operating in the sector covered by the market organization for tobacco.", "Inter-branch organizations which:\n1. comprise representatives of the economic activities relating to production of, processing of and trade in tobacco;\n2. have been set up on the initiative of all or some of their constituent organizations or associations;\n3. are pursuing a number of the following activities at regional level, in a number of Community regions or throughout the Community;

On application, Member States shall recognize inter-branch organizations established in their territory which:\n(a) carry out their activities at regional or inter-regional level within the territory;\n(b) cover a significant proportion of the production and/or trade in relation to the sphere of action and the branches represented; where an inter-branch organization is inter-regional in scope, it must provide proof of minimum representativeness, in  respect of each of the grouped branches, in each region covered;\n(c) pursue a number of the activities referred to in Article 2 (3);\n(d) do not themselves undertake the production, processing or marketing of the products covered by the market organization referred to in Article 1.\n2. Prior to recognition being granted, Member States shall notify the Commission of the inter-branch organizations which have applied for recognition and provide all necessary information on the branches of economic activity which they encompass, their  representativeness, the activities undertaken and any other information required for consideration of the application.\nThe Commission may oppose recognition within 60 days of notification by the Member State.\n3.

If, following expiry of the three-month period referred to in the second indent of paragraph 2, the Commission finds that the conditions for applying this Regulation have not been met, it shall take a decision declaring that Article 85 (1) of the  Treaty applies to the agreement or concerted practice in question.\nThat decision shall not come into effect earlier than the date of notification to the inter-branch organization concerned, unless that inter-branch organization has given incorrect information or abused the exemption provided for in paragraph 1.", "1.

Following publication, the Member States  and the socio-economic groups concerned shall have two months in which to make their comments.\n4. If the rules of which extension is requested are 'technical rules' within the meaning of Directive 83/189/EEC (5), they shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 8 of that Directive at the same time as the notification provided  for in paragraph 2.\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 5, where the conditions for delivery of a reasoned opinion under Article 9 of that Directive are met, the Commission shall refuse to approve the rules of which extension has been requested.\n5.
