This situation has already resulted in high local prices, causing supply difficulties at competitive prices.\n(3) Hungary has significant intervention stocks of common wheat, outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1080/2005\u00a0(3) opened a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Spanish market of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency, which expired on 14 September 2005 even though the quantities made available under that Regulation had not been fully used up, in particular as a result of difficulties linked to the entry of the cereals into the Spanish ports.\n(5) In view of the continuing market situation and the projected applications by operators, stocks of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency should continue to be made available on the Spanish cereals market, in quantities equivalent to those fixed during the previous invitation to tender. However, the cereals should no longer be required to pass through specific Spanish sea ports.\n(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(7) It is also important that the Hungarian intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(8) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hungarian intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 200\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes of common wheat held by it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These sales are intended to supply the Spanish market.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding that Regulation:\n(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the minimum selling price shall be fixed at a level that does not disturb the cereals markets.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, the tender security is set at EUR\u00a010 per tonne.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by the tenderer\u2019s written commitment to lodge a security of EUR\u00a080 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 5 October 2005.\nThe closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Wednesday at 15.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 2 November and 28 December 2005 and 12 April, 24 May and 14 June 2006, i.e. weeks when no invitation to tender shall be made.\nThe closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial invitation to tender shall be 28 June 2006 at 15.00 (Brussels time).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders must be lodged with the Hungarian intervention agency at the following address:\nMez\u0151gazdas\u00e1gi \u00e9s Vid\u00e9kfejleszt\u00e9si Hivatal\nAlkotm\u00e1ny u. 29.\nH-1385 Budapest 62\nPf. 867\nTel.
