It shall in particular serve industrial regions and major  conurbations and link up with the major seaports.\nThe minimum technical specifications adopted for the network's waterways shall correspond to Class IV (4). Where an inland waterway forming part of this network is modernized or created, the technical specifications should correspond at least to Class  IV and permit subsequent transition to Class Va/Vb (5) and the passage in a satisfactory way of vessels used for combined transport.\nThe network shall be developed as specified in the plan shown on the map in the Annex.", "Wherever possible and taking account in particular of the financial constraints on Member States, the priority projects of Community interest listed below and relating to the provision of missing links and the elimination of bottlenecks should be  initiated within 10 years:\n1. improvement of the Mittellandkanal and construction of the aqueduct over the Elbe at Magdeburg;\n2. improvement of the navigability of the Elbe between Magdeburg and the Czech frontier;\n3. improvement of the links between the Elbe and Oder;\n4. linking the Twentekanaal and the Mittellandkanal;\n5. linking the Rhine and the Rh\u0102\u00b4ne;\n6. linking the Seine and the Scheldt in France and the Scheldt in Belgium;\n7. north-south axis, link between the Scheldt and the Rhine;\n(a) improvement of the Antwerp-Brussels- Charleroi axis;\n(b) improvement of the eastern section towards the Rhine via the Central Canal, the Meuse, the Lanaye Canal in Belgium and the Juliana Canal in the Netherlands;\n8. linking the Main and the Danube and improving the Main and Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen;\n9. improvement of the navigability of the Danube between Vienna and the Black Sea (non-Community project).", "The plan for the network is of an indicative nature. Its purpose is to promote measures by the Member States and, as appropriate, by the Community with the aim of carrying out projects that are part of the network in order to ensure its cohesion and  interoperability.\nThis Decision is without prejudice to any financial commitment on the part of any Member State or of the Community.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nIt shall apply until 30 June 1995.\nThe Council, acting in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Treaty, shall adopt new rules for trans-European networks in the transport infrastructure sector along multimodal lines, which shall enter into force not later than 1 July 1995.\nThe relevant Commission proposals will be accompanied by a report on application of this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 1993.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.
