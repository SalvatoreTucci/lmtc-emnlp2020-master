whereas the Community tariff quota concerned should therefore be opened for 1989;\nWhereas the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 1059/88 of 28 March 1988 laying down the arrangements applicable to Greece's trade with Turkey (2); whereas, the Council has also adopted Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the  arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal, on the one hand, and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey, on the other (3); whereas the tariff quota in question applies therefore to the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985.\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all importers of the Member States and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into the said Member States until  the quota is exhausted;\nWhereas, for the period of application of this Regulation, it appears necessary to maintain an allocation between the Member States of the quotas concerned, since the administrations of the Member States are unable to provide by 1 January 1989, the administrative and technical conditions required for the Community management of quotas for these products originating in  Turkey; whereas it does, however, seem advisable to provide for a further increase in the Community reserve;\nWhereas provision should be made for a mechanism to prevent, when the Community quota is not used up, goods being imported into a Member State which has used up its share only after the full application of customs duties, or after having been diverted  to another Member State whose share has not yet been used up; whereas under these circumstances, if, during the quota period, the Community reserve were to be almost entirely used up, Member States should return to the said reserve all of the unused  portion of their initial shares so as to avoid part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State, when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, taking into account the traditional trends in trade, the allocation maintained between Member States must, so as to reflect as well as possible the acutal market trend of the products in question, be carried out pro rata the needs of the Member  States, calculated, on the one hand, on the basis of the statistical data relating to imports of the said products from Turkey over a representative reference period and, on the other hand, on the basis of the economic outlook for the quota periods  considered;\nWhereas, on the basis of the currently available statistical data, imports of the product in question from Turkey into the Member States have developed as follows over the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, whereas they represent the following percentages of  total imports into the Community from Turkey:\nMember State 1985 1986 1987 tonnes % tonnes % tonnes % Benelux  5 266  7,10  6 202  8,25  6 903  8,79 Denmark    792  1,07    868  1,15    869  1,10 Germany 47 225 63,65 49 716 66,12 50 513 64,29 Greece      0  0,\n0  0,\n0  0,\nFrance  9 416 12,69  9 129 12,14  8 845 11,26 Ireland     28  0,03      0   , 0     20  0,02 Italy  5 206  7,02  3 179  4,23  6 944  8,84 United Kingdom  6 264  8,44  6 099  8,11  4 480  5,70 Total  74 197 75 193 78 574  Whereas, in view of these factors and of market forecasts for the products concerned for 1989 and, in particular, the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial percentage shares can be expressed approximately as follows:\nBenelux8,06 Denmark1,73 Germany64,68 France12,02 Ireland0,07 Italy6,05 United Kingdom7,39 Whereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any  subsequent requirements of these Member States as well as those Member States which do not participate in the initial allocation; whereas to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, the first part of the tariff quota should be set  at a relatively high level, which in this case could be approximately 60 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas Member States may use up their initial shares at different rates; whereas, to provide for this eventuality and to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies, any Member State which has used up its initial share should draw additional shares in quantities corresponding to their real requirements, as many times as the reserve allows; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission and the latter must be able to monitor  the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota shares allocated to  that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.

Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that additional drawings of shares pursuant to Article 3 are carried out in such a way that imports may be charged without interruption against their accumulated shares in the Community tariff quotas.\n2.  Member States shall ensure that importers of the products concerned have free access to the quota shares allocated to them, or which they have levied on the reserve.\n3.  Member States shall charge imports of the products concerned against their shares as and when the goods are entered with the customs authorities for free circulation.\n4.  The extent to which a Member State has used up its shares shall be determined on the basis of the imports charged in accordance with paragraph 3.", "At the request of the Commission, Member States shall inform it of imports of the products in question actually charged against their quota shares.", "The Member States and the Commission shall cooperate closely to ensure that this Regulation is complied with.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1989.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 1988.\nFor the Council The President Th.
