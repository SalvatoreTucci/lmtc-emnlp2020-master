That Article provides for the application of this measure on the basis of the situation of each quotation area.\n(5) In view of the particularly difficult market situation due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and considering that the conditions laid down in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 have been met it has been judged opportune to initiate such a procedure in Great Britain. In order to ensure that the carcasses taken into storage are of an appropriate quality it is necessary to fix a minimum weight. It is also necessary to restrict the regions from where lambs are procured to those that are provisionally free of foot-and-mouth disease and to derogate from the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3446/90 as regards marking of carcasses.\n(6) Provision should be made to allow deboning during the period of placing in storage. However, in the interest of simplification the contracts should be based on the weight of the carcasses taken into storage. It is therefore necessary to derogate from the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3446/90.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["1. Invitations to tender are hereby opened in Great Britain for aid to private storage for carcasses and half-carcasses of lamb with a minimum carcass weight of 15 kg. The carcasses and half-carcasses shall be presented in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 and shall originate from lambs procured from farms situated in regions where there has been no outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease during the past 90 days and which have been slaughtered in such regions.\n2.

The intervention agency may require that notification of intention to make use of this facility be given at least two working days before the placing in storage of each individual lot. Large tendons, cartilage, pieces of fat and other scraps left over from cutting or boning may not be stored;\n2. placing in storage shall begin, for each individual lot of the contractual quantity, on the day on which it comes under the control of the intervention agency. That day shall be the day on which the net weight of the fresh or chilled product is determined:\n(a) at the place of the storage, where the meat is frozen on the premises;\n(b) at the place of freezing, where the meat is frozen in suitable facilities outside the place of storage;\n(c) at the place of deboning or cutting, where the meat is placed in storage after deboning or cutting;\n3. the amount of aid shall be fixed per tonne and shall relate to the weight determined in accordance with paragraph 2.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 312, 20.11.1998, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 8.\n(3) OJ L 333, 30.11.1990, p. 39.\n(4) OJ L 321, 23.12.1993, p. 9.\n(5) OJ L 333, 30.11.1990, p. 46.\n(6) OJ L 10, 13.1.1996, p. 6.\n(7) OJ L 214, 30.7.1992, p. 1.\n(8) OJ L 347, 18.12.1997, p. 6.\n(9) OJ L 104, 13.4.2001, p. 6."}
