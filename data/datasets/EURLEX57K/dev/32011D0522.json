The Union has repeatedly emphasised that the brutal repression must be stopped, detained protesters released, free access by international humanitarian and human rights organisations and media allowed, and a genuine and inclusive national dialogue launched. The Syrian leadership, however, has remained defiant with regard to calls from the Union as well as from the broad international community.\n(3) In this context, the Union has decided to adopt additional restrictive measures against the Syrian regime.\n(4) The restrictions on admission and the freezing of funds and economic resources should be applied to additional persons and entities benefiting from or supporting the regime, in particular persons and entities financing the regime, or providing logistical support to the regime, in particular the security apparatus, or who undermine the efforts towards a peaceful transition to democracy in Syria.\n(5) In addition, the purchase, import or transport from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products should be prohibited.\n(6) In this regard, it should be noted that a partial suspension of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Syrian Arab Republic\u00a0(2) has been decided by the Council in its Decision 2011/523/EU of 2 September 2011\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["Council Decision 2011/273/CFSP is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the following Articles are added:\n(2) Article 3(1) is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 4(1) is replaced by the following:\n(4) the following points are added to Article 4(3):\n\u2018(e) necessary for humanitarian purposes, such as delivering or facilitating the delivery of assistance, including medical supplies, food, humanitarian workers and related assistance, or evacuating foreign nationals from Syria;\n(f) to be paid into or from an account of a diplomatic or consular mission or an international organisation enjoying immunities in accordance with international law, in so far as such payments are intended to be used for official purposes of the diplomatic or consular mission or international organisation.\u2019.", "The persons and entities listed in the Annex to this Decision shall be added in the list set out in the Annex to Decision 2011/273/CFSP.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 September 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
