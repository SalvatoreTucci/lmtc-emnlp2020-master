This initial payment in advance shall constitute an instalment on the payment in advance provided for in paragraph 2.\nThe advance referred to in the frist subparagraph shall be calculated on the basis of the weights recorded in the silo of the port of loading by the competent French authorities or the persons acting under their supervision, converted into white sugar according to a standard yield of 96 %.\nApplications as referred to in the frist subsparagraph must be accompanied by the lodging of a security corresponding to the amount of the advance applied for.
