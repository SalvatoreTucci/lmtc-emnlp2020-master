Gluten can cause adverse effects to those people and therefore it should be absent or present in very low amounts in their diet.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 41/2009\u00a0(2) sets out harmonised rules on the information that is provided to consumers on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in food. Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) foresees the repeal of Regulation (EC) No 41/2009 from 20 July 2016.\n(6) Consumers should continue to be appropriately informed and not misled or confused when information on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in foods is provided by food business operators after the repeal of Regulation (EC) No 41/2009. It is therefore necessary to amend paragraph 3 of Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 in order to allow the Commission to establish uniform conditions for food information on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in food that may be provided by food business operators,", "main_body": ["In the first subparagraph of Article 36(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, the following point (d) is added:\n\u2018(d) information on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in food.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 18.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 41/2009 of 20 January 2009 concerning the composition and labelling of foodstuffs suitable for people intolerant to gluten (OJ L 16, 21.1.2009, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control and repealing Council Directive 92/52/EEC, Commission Directives 96/8/EC, 1999/21/EC, 2006/125/EC and 2006/141/EC, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 41/2009 and (EC) No 953/2009 (OJ L 181, 29.6.2013, p. 35)."}
