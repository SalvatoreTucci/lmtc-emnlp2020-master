Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation and questionnaires were sent to all parties concerned.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) On 1 March 2006 CEFIC formally withdrew its complaint.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of silicon carbide originating in Romania should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of silicon carbide, currently classifiable within CN code 2849\u00a020\u00a000 and originating in Romania, is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 June 2006.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
