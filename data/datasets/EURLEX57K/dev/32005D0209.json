Pending this possible arrangement, Australia has requested a prolongation of the temporary access to the Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.\n(3) New Zealand has requested a prolongation of the temporary access to the Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens due to unforeseen delays in the constitution of its own stocks of such antigens.\n(4) Taking account of the capacity and availability of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens stored in the Community antigen reserves, it appears that the prolongation requested by Australia and New Zealand may be granted without unnecessarily compromising the Community\u2019s contingency arrangements.\n(5) Therefore, the requested prolongation of the temporary access of Australia and New Zealand to the Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens should be granted and Decision 2004/288/EC amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1(1) of Decision 2004/288/EC, \u201831 December 2004\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2005\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 306, 22.11.2003, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 30.3.2004, p. 58."}
