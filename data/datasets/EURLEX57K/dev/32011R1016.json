It is therefore appropriate to operate deductions on the fishing quotas allocated to them in 2011 and, where appropriate, in subsequent years, for the overfished stocks.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1004/2010\u00a0(10) has operated deductions from fishing quotas for 2010. However, for certain Member States the deductions to be applied were higher than their respective 2010 quota and could therefore not be operated entirely in that year. To ensure that also in such cases the full amount be deducted, the remaining quantities should be taken into account when establishing deductions from 2011 and, where appropriate, subsequent quotas.\n(7) Deductions provided for by this Regulation should apply without prejudice to deductions applicable to 2011 quotas pursuant to:\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 147/2007 of 15 February 2007 adapting certain fish quotas from 2007 to 2012 pursuant to Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(11),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 635/2008 of 3 July 2008 adapting the cod fishing quotas to be allocated to Poland in the Baltic Sea (Subdivisions 25-32, EC Waters) from 2008 to 2011 pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/2008\u00a0(12),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 of 22 February 2011 providing for deductions from certain mackerel quotas allocated to Spain in 2011 and subsequent years on account of overfishing in 2010\u00a0(13), and\n\u2014 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1021/2011 of 14\u00a0October 2011 operating deductions from fishing quotas available for certain stocks in 2011, on account of overfishing of other stocks in the previous year\u00a0(14),", "main_body": ["The fishing quotas fixed in Regulations (EU) No 1124/2010, (EU) No 1225/2010, (EU) No 1256/2010, and (EU) No 57/2011 for the year 2011 are reduced as shown in the Annex.", "The fishing quotas that may be allocated to Member States in 2012 and, where appropriate, in subsequent years shall be reduced as shown in the Annex.", "Articles 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to reductions provided for in Regulations (EC) No 147/2007, (EC) No 635/2008, (EU) No 165/2011 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1021/2011.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 September 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 352, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 330, 16.12.2009, p.1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 24.12.2009, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 21, 26.1.2010, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 318, 4.12.2010, p.1.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 21.12.2010, p.1.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 29.12.2010, p. 2.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 27.1.2011, p. 1.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 291, 9.11.2010, p. 31.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 46, 16.2.2007, p. 10.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 4.7.2008, p. 8.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 48, 23.2.2011, p. 11.\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0See page 16 of this Official Journal.\nANNEX\nDeductions on account of overfishing and outstanding balances from 2010\nMS Species code Area code Species name Area name Initial Quota 2010 Permitted landings 2010 Total catches 2010 Overfishing related to permitted landing Overfishing related to permitted landing Multiplying factor 105(2) Multiplying factor 105(3) Deductions 2011 Remaining deduction from 2010 Initial quota 2011 Revised Qty 2011 Outstanding balance\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17)\nBEL SRX 2AC4-C Skates and rays EU waters of IIa and IV 235,00\u00a0(1) 299,00 304,80 1,94 5,80 1 1 \u20135,80  235,00\u00a0(4) 229,20\nBEL WHG 2AC4.
