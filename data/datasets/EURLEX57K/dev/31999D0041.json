The actions provided for in the technical action plan for improving agricultural statistics (TAPAS) in 1999 are intended as a continuation of some of the actions begun as part of the 1996/97 and 1998 action plans (1), especially:\n(i) improvement and rapid transmission of fruit and vegetable statistics;\n(ii) balances;\nand include actions in a new field:\n(iii) the use of pesticides.\nThe Commission shall contribute to the costs of actions undertaken in these fields. The contribution payable to each Member State shall not exceed the amounts indicated in Table A.\n2. The actions submitted by the Member States must relate to:\n(i) improvement and rapid transmission of fruit and vegetable statistics:\nThe aim is to have available, as soon as possible after the harvest, reliable statistics on Community production of the main fruits and vegetables. This makes it necessary for all the Member States to provide Eurostat with reliable, up-to-date information on the areas under these crops and on their production volumes.\nTo this end, and to complement the actions begun in 1997, the Commission shall make a Community contribution, subject to the ceilings indicated in Table A, to those Member States wishing to put in place additional tools for improving their knowledge of their national production of fruit and vegetables which are of Community interest.\n(ii) balances:\nThis action is designed to improve the data on balances:\n(a) cereal balances and balances of other arable crops, fruit and vegetable balances, dairy product balances, meat (including poultry) balances, other balances;\n(b) fodder balances.\nIn order to continue the effort made by the Member States as part of the 1996/1997 and 1998 TAPAS action plans, the Commission shall make a Community contribution, subject to the ceilings indicated in Table A, to those Member States which submit new projects for action in this field.\n(iii) use of pesticides:\nThe purpose of this action is to promote the collection of data on the use of pesticides. It may take the form of a pilot survey covering a particular type of crop (for example, cereals or fruits). The types of crop shall be selected by the Member States in the light of their importance in terms of the area under the crops concerned or the quantity of pesticides used.\nThe data which are to be collected relate to: (1) the crop treated; (2) the area under the crop; (3) the area treated; (4) the active ingredient applied (to be identified on the basis of information about the product, provided by the farm operator); (5) the quantity used or the rate of application; and (6) the periods of application.\nThe Commission shall make a Community contribution, subject to the ceilings indicated in Table A, to Member States which submit projects in this field.\n>TABLE>\n(1) OJ L 6, 10. 1. 1997, p. 45\nOJ L 240, 2. 9. 1997, p. 10\nOJ L 70, 10. 3. 1998, p. 23."}
