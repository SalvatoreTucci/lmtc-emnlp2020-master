whereas it later  forwarded additional information concerning the programme;\nWhereas it is necessary to consider whether the programme fulfils the conditions laid down in  Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and  national financial aid for the sector concerned;\nWhereas the objectives for reducing fleet capacity fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programme constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the  effort still needed to ensure that the objectives are achieved;\nWhereas the Commission adopted a transitional programme for 1992 (5); whereas the objectives fixed  in the Portuguese transitional programme should be included in the objectives of the present  programme;\nWhereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in  order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in  particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is most apparent; whereas coefficients for the  reduction of fishing effort, differentiated according to fishery or group of fisheries, should  therefore be applied to the segments of the fleet thus identified;\nWhereas account must be taken of an annual increase of 2 % in fishing effort linked to technical  progress;\nWhereas available biological and economic analyses suggest that overall reduction in fishing  effort, differentiated for the broad groups of target species, should be of 20 % for demersal  species, 15 % for benthic species and zero growth in effort for pelagic species;\nWhereas, in order to attain these objectives and improve fishing methods, reductions in effort  should primarily be focused on segments of the fleet using non-selective gear, particularly those  likely to catch large numbers of juveniles, while ensuring that there is no increase in segments  using more selective gear;.\nWhereas, in order to attain the objectives of the programme, it may be necessary to take steps to  influence all the parameters connected with fishing mortality, particularly the capacity and  activity of the fleet; whereas, however, structural measures must be focused chiefly on the  elimination of excess capacity;\nWhereas it is necessary to verify that the objectives fixed in the programme are progressively and  coherently met; whereas intermediate and indicative annual objectives should therefore be  determined as a basis for Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4028/86;\nWhereas in addition to the six-monthly transmission by Portugal of statements concerning  development of the fishing fleet and, where applicable, its activity, it is necessary to ensure  that these data tally with the information in the Community register of fishing vessels;\nWhereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the  objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken  under this programme may not warrant Community financial assistance;\nWhereas to programme a concerted and balanced reduction in the overall fishing effort of the  Community's fleets requires the Community aid scheme to be focused on measures enabling the  objectives of the programme to be attained within the deadlines laid down; whereas priority  should  also be given to investments aimed at bringing the fleet into line with Community rules on hygiene  and safety and to investments in the development of selective fisheries which cause minimum damage  to the marine environment;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the  Standing Committee for the Fishing Industry,", "main_body": ["The multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet for the  period 1992 to 1996, as forwarded by the Portugal Government on 30 April 1991 and supplemented by  the Government at a later date, is hereby approved subject to the conditions laid down in this  Decision and provided that those conditions are met.", "In order to ensure a durable balance between fishery resources and the fishing effort  of the Community fleet, Portugal has segmented its fishing fleet as shown in the Annex. The  following coefficients shall be applied to the fishing capacity of the segments thus obtained:\n- 20 % to segments practising bottom trawling in teams or using an otter trawl and fishing for  demersal stocks,\n- 15 % to dredgers and beam trawlers for benthic stocks,\n- 0 %, i.e. zero growth in other segments.\nThese reductions shall apply to the objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 as the starting point for  the transitional programme for 1992 adopted for Portugal and based on the situation of the fishing  fleet at 1 January 1992 as presented by that Member State.", "1.  The reduction in fishing effort may result from the combined effect of reductions  in capacity and reductions in activity.\n2.  At least 55 % of the overall objective of the programme, defined as the sum of the partial  objectives for each segment, must be achieved by means of reductions in capacity.\n3.  The remainder may be achieved by means of measures to reduce activity, such as restrictions in  time at sea, provided that they are based on permanent laws and administrative provisions accepted  by the Commission and techniques approved by the Commission.\n4.  The final objectives for each segment and the annual intermediate indicative objectives shall  be determined in accordance with points 2 and 4 of the additional provisions in the Annex.", "At the latest by 15 February and 31 July of each year for the previous six-month  periods ending on 31 December and 30 June respectively, Portugal shall forward to the Commission,  in respect of each segment of the fishing fleet defined in the Annex, information on the number of  vessels commissioned, the tonnage and engine power added and withdrawn, as the case may be, and the  time at sea by homogeneous group of vessels, with their six-monthly variations, pursuant to the  special provisions of the programme.\nSuch information shall tally with the information forwarded in accordance with Commission  Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 163/89 (1) on the Community register of fishing vessels.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Portugal."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 1992.\nFor the Commission Manuel MAR\u00cdN Vice-President\n(1) OJ N\u00b0 L 376, 31. 12. 1986. p. 7.\n(2) See page 1 of this Official Journal.\n(3) OJ N\u00b0 L 24, 27. 1. 1983, p. 2.\n(4) Resolution A3-0175/92.\n(5) OJ N\u00b0 L 193, 13. 7. 1992.\n(1) OJ N\u00b0 L 20, 25. 1. 1989, p. 5.\nANNEX\nMULTIANNUAL GUIDANCE PROGRAMME FOR THE FISHING FLEET OF PORTUGAL FOR THE PERIOD  1993 TO 1996\nI. TABLES OF OBJECTIVES (Refer to the end of the Annex) II. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS 1. Segmentation Segmentation of the fleet shall take account of the different resources fished and fishing zones  (coastal, Community and international/third country, Mediterranean and waters of the remotest  Community regions), the groups of species targeted (demersal, benthic and pelagic) and the gear  used.\nThe segments thus determined shall be homogeneous and distinct, i.e. the objectives fixed for each  segment must be attained by the end of the programme.\n2. Final objectives for each segment The final objectives shall be fixed in terms of capacity (tonnage in GRT and engine power in kW) on  the basis of the initial objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the transitional programme for  1992.\nThe following formula shall be used to determine the objective for each segment:\nLet (a) be a segment for which the capacity in tonnage and engine power at 1 January 1992 is known  and to which a reduction coefficient (y) is applied.\nSegment objective (a) = (1 y) \u00d7 situation at 1. 1. 1992 \u00d7 overall objective at 31. 12. 1991overall  situation at 1. 1. 1992 3. Calculation of reductions in activity By the end of the programme, for the Member States applying this provision, activity must be  reduced to a predetermined level not exceeding the authorized limits, so that the sum of the annual  intermediate reductions in activity is at least equal to that which would result from a linear  reduction in activity year by year.\nThe reductions in fishing effort thus achieved will be calculated at the end of the programme so  that the objectives can be readjusted by a percentage equal to that due to the effect of the  reductions in activity on overall fishing effort.\nNon-application of these measures may not result in an authorization to increase activity.\n4. Annual intermediate objectives In order to ensure proper monitoring based on the gradual achievement of the objectives fixed in  the programme, annual intermediate objectives shall be set for the programme. These objectives  shall be expressed as a percentage of the objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programmes.\nIn addition to the single objective of 2 % fixed in the transitional programme for 1992, a  percentage equal to 25 % of the overall objective less 2 % should be achieved in each year of the  programme, starting from 31 December 1993.\n5. Implementation and monitoring Implementation of the measures to reduce the activity of vessels in certain segments of the fleet  will require that the Member State provide the Commission with the assurance that it will have the  following information for each of the segments concerned:\n- the data on the level of activity prior to the entry into force of the measures (reference basis:  1991),\n- assurance that it has effective time at sea management tools and is able to manage licensing  schemes, particularly with regard to multipurpose vessels,\n- data for monitoring the effect of the measures implemented under this programme in accordance  with Article 2 and the rules on the Community register of fishing vessels. Such measures must  produce effects which can be checked by the Commission pursuant to the Community rules on  controls.\n6. Planned measures Notwithstanding Articles 6 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4028/86, priority shall be given to:\n- measures to adjust fishing capacity in line with exploitable resources,\n- investments carried out on board vessels in order to bring them into line with Community rules on  hygiene and safety,\n- investments to improve fishing methods and allow fishing which is more selective and/or less  damaging to the marine environment,\n- investments carried out on board vessels to improve the control of fishing operations.\nThe Commission hereby reminds local, regional and national authorities that any structural aid  granted to the sector in question must be included in the present programme.\n7. Revision of the programme The programme may be revised, on the initiative of the Commission, in the light of the experience  gained and the national and Community rules in force, in order to take account of new factors which  might help improve the implementation of the programme and ensure that its objectives are better  met.\nSuch revision must take place before the end of 1994.\nRevision may, if necessary, include the insertion into the programme of the tools for managing  measures to reduce the activity of fishing vessels for certain segments of the fleet. To this end  the objectives of the segments concerned will be expressed in a unit of measurement of capacity  (engine power and/or tonnage) per activity (time at sea), or using any other formula approved by  the Commission.\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>"}
