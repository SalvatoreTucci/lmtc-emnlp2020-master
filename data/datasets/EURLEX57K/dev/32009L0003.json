However, experience has shown that, given the local character of those exemptions and the limited number of products concerned, maintaining the exemptions would not result in a non-tariff barrier to trade and, as a consequence, there is no longer a need to put an end to those exemptions.\n(2) It is appropriate to clarify that the scope of Directive\u00a080/181/EEC is consistent with the objectives referred to in Article\u00a095 of the Treaty and that it is not limited to any specific Community fields of action.\n(3) Directive\u00a080/181/EEC authorises the use of supplementary indications in addition to the legal units laid down in Chapter I of the Annex to that Directive until 31\u00a0December\u00a02009. However, in order to avoid creating obstacles for Community undertakings exporting to certain third countries that require products to be marked in other units than those laid down in Chapter\u00a0I, it is appropriate to maintain the authorisation to use supplementary indications.\n(4) Directive\u00a080/181/EEC supports the smooth functioning of the internal market through the level of harmonisation of units of measurement it prescribes. In this context, it is appropriate that the Commission monitor market developments relating to that Directive and its implementation, notably as concerns possible obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and any further harmonisation required to overcome those obstacles.\n(5) It is appropriate that the Commission continue to strongly pursue, in the context of its third country trade relations, including the Transatlantic Economic Council, the acceptance in third country markets of products labelled only in the units of the International System of Units (SI).\n(6) Supplementary indications could also allow the gradual and smooth introduction of new metric units which may be developed at the international level.\n(7) In 1995, the General Conference on Weights and Measures decided to eliminate the class of SI supplementary units as a separate class in the SI and to interpret the units \u2018radian\u2019 and \u2018steradian\u2019 as dimensionless SI derived units, the names and symbols of which may, but need not, be used in expressions for other SI derived units, as is convenient.\n(8) In 1999, the General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted, within the framework of the SI, the \u2018katal\u2019, the symbol of which is \u2018kat\u2019, as the SI unit for catalytic activity. This new harmonised SI unit was intended to ensure a coherent and uniform indication of units of measurement in the fields of medicine and biochemistry and, as a consequence, to eliminate any risk of misunderstanding arising from the use of non-harmonised units.\n(9) In 2007, in order to eliminate one of the major sources of the observed variability between different realisations of the water triple point, the General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted a note on the definition of the \u2018kelvin\u2019. The \u2018kelvin\u2019 is defined as a fraction of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. The note refers to water of a specific isotopic composition.\n(10) Since the acre is no longer in use for land registration purposes in the United Kingdom and Ireland, there is no longer any need to provide for an exemption in that respect.\n(11) In accordance with point\u00a034 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(12) Directive 80/181/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 80/181/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1(b) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) those listed in Chapter\u00a0II of the Annex only in those Member States where they were authorised on 21\u00a0April\u00a01973.\u2019;\n(2) Article 2(a) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) The obligations arising under Article\u00a01 relate to measuring instruments used, measurements made and indications of quantity expressed in units of measurement.\u2019;\n(3) Article\u00a03(2) shall be replaced by the following:\n(4) the following Article shall be inserted:\n(5) the Annex shall be amended as follows:\n(a) in Chapter\u00a0I, point\u00a01.1, the paragraph entitled \u2018Unit of thermodynamic temperature\u2019 shall be replaced by the following:\n(b) in Chapter\u00a0I, point\u00a01.1.1, the title shall be replaced by the following:\n(c) in Chapter\u00a0I, point\u00a01.2, the title shall be replaced by the following:\n(d) in Chapter\u00a0I, point\u00a01.2.1 shall be deleted;\n(e) in Chapter\u00a0I, points\u00a01.2.2 and\u00a01.2.3 shall be replaced by the following:\nQuantity Unit Expression\nName Symbol In terms of other SI units In terms of SI base units\nPlane angle radian rad  m \u0387 m\u20131\nSolid angle steradian sr  m2 \u0387 m\u20132\nFrequency hertz Hz  s\u20131\nForce newton N  m \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20132\nPressure, stress pascal Pa N \u0387 m\u20132 m\u20131 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20132\nEnergy, work; quantity of heat joule J N \u0387 m m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20132\nPower\u00a0(5), radiant flux watt W J \u0387 s\u20131 m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20133\nQuantity of electricity, electric charge coulomb C  s \u0387 A\nElectric potential, potential difference, electromotive force volt V W \u0387 A\u20131 m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20133 \u0387 A\u20131\nElectric resistance ohm \u03a9 V \u0387 A\u20131 m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20133 \u0387 A\u20132\nConductance siemens S A \u0387 V\u20131 m\u20132 \u0387 kg\u20131 \u0387 s3 \u0387 A2\nCapacitance farad F C \u0387 V\u20131 m\u20132 \u0387 kg\u20131 \u0387 s4 \u0387 A2\nMagnetic flux weber Wb V \u0387 s m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20132 \u0387 A\u20131\nMagnetic flux density tesla T Wb \u0387 m\u20132 kg \u0387 s\u20132 \u0387 A\u20131\nInductance henry H Wb \u0387 A\u20131 m2 \u0387 kg \u0387 s\u20132 \u0387 A\u20132\nLuminous flux lumen lm cd \u0387 sr cd\nIlluminance lux lx lm \u0387 m\u20132 m\u20132 \u0387 cd\nActivity (of a radionuclide) becquerel Bq  s\u20131\nAbsorbed dose, specific energy imparted, kerma, absorbed dose index gray Gy J \u0387 kg\u20131 m2 \u0387 s\u20132\nDose equivalent sievert Sv J \u0387 kg\u20131 m2 \u0387 s\u20132\nCatalytic activity katal kat  mol \u0387 s\u20131\n(f) in Chapter II, the following row shall be deleted from the table:\n\u2018Land registration acre 1 ac = 4\u00a0047 m2 ac\u2019\n(g) in Chapter\u00a0II, the final sentence shall be replaced by the following: \u2018The units listed in this Chapter may be combined with each other or with those in Chapter\u00a0I to form compound units.\u2019", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, no later than 31\u00a0December\u00a02009, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
