whereas inter-trade agreements and contracts concluded between buyers and sellers of beet must conform to these outline provisions;\nWhereas Article 30 (3) of the same Regulation provides for the Council to adopt general rules for the application of Article 30 (1) of that Regulation ; whereas under the said Article 30 (1) a differentiation must be made in each contract for the delivery of beet, depending on whether the quantities of sugar to be manufactured form the beet are within the basic quota, outside the basic quota but within the maximum quota, or outside the maximum quota;\nWhereas there are at present throughout the Community very detailed written contracts for the delivery of beet for sugar manufacture ; whereas such contracts contain, among others, provisions concerning the purchase price of beet, the staggering of deliveries, collection centres, the reception of beet, any return of the pulp and payment for beet ; whereas such contracts include, furthermore, other provisions which differ from one region to another;\nWhereas varying natural, economic and technical conditions lead to great difficulties in the standardising of all conditions of purchase for beet within the Community ; whereas the outline provisions should therefore only define the minimum guarantees required by both beet growers and sugar manufactures to ensure the proper functioning of the sugar market ; whereas such guarantees should wherever possible be the same as those in use before the entry into force of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC ; whereas account should therefore be taken of the latest situation, that is to say the situation prevailing during the 1967/68 marketing year ; whereas, however, where rules applicable during that marketing year are referred to, provision must be made for a means of amending them ; whereas any such amendment must be the subject of an agreement between manufacturers and growers;\nWhereas in most areas of the Community beet growers and sugar manufactures have formed trade organisations ; whereas inter-trade agreements at present exist between manufacturers or manufacturers' organisations on the one hand and growers' organisations on the other ; whereas such agreements concern in particular the conditions of purchase for beet ; whereas, therefore, the possibility of derogating from the rules in force should be confined to inter-trade agreements ; whereas, in the absence of an inter-trade agreement as defined above, the arrangements existing before the conclusion of contracts between the manufacturer and some of his growers should be regarded as an inter-trade agreement;\nWhereas, so that the outline provisions may have the widest possible area of application, the contracting parties should be defined as beet sellers on the one hand and sugar manufacturers on the other;\nWhereas the proper functioning of the sugar market, and especially of the quota system, requires that contracts be made in writing and that a specified quantity be indicated therein ; whereas, for the same reasons, in contracts containing the differentiation referred to in Article 30 (1) of the above-mentioned Regulation, the minimum purchase prices, the sugar content taken as the basis and, for the purpose of taking account of other sugar contents, the factors  1)OJ No 308, 18.12.1967, p. 1.\nused for converting the quantities of beet supplied into quantities equivalent to the sugar content taken as the basis should be indicated ; whereas, to avoid distortion of competition, provision should be made for the distribution of any production within the basic quota for which the manufacturer has not signed pre-sowing delivery contracts ; whereas, in order to prevent a weakening of the concept of the minimum price for beet, it is necessary, particularly where overproduction is caused only by an eventual yield greater than the basic yield anticipated by the manufacturer, to provide that he may not require sellers to reimburse the production levy in respect of beet for which he has signed a delivery contract in accordance with Article 30 (1) (a) of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC.\nWhereas provisions concerning the normal duration and staggering of deliveries, collection centres, transport costs, reception points, the stage at which samples are drawn, the return of pulp or payment of an equivalent compensation, and the delays caused by payments on account influence the actual price obtained for beet by the seller ; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for such matters;\nWhereas, to take account of the different interests of sellers within the Community, contracting parties should be allowed, for the purpose of determining the gross weight, tare and sugar content, to choose between several provisions defining the persons who are to take part therein, one of which provides for supervision by the sellers' trade organisation;\nWhereas it will suffice for the present to lay down that inter-trade agreements should not include provisions contrary to those laid down for contracts and that some of them should contain an arbitration clause ; whereas such agreements, as also the contracts, may regulate matters not covered by the provisions of this Regulation;", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation:    1. \"contracting party\" means:      (a) a sugar manufacturer, hereinafter called a \"manufacturer\";\n(b) a beet seller, hereinafter called a \"seller\";\n2. \"contract\" means : a contract concluded between a seller and a manufacturer for the delivery of beet for the manufacture of sugar;\n3. \"inter-trade agreement\" means:      (a) an agreement concluded at Community level between a group of national manufacturers' organisations on the one hand and a group of national sellers' organisations on the other, prior to the conclusion of any contract;\n(b) an agreement concluded by manufacturers or a manufacturers' organisation recognised by the Member State in question on the one hand and a sellers' association recognised by the Member State in question on the other, prior to the conclusion of any contract;\n(c) the provisions of the law on companies or firms and of the law on co-operatives, in so far as they govern the delivery of sugar beet by the share holders or the members of a company, firm or co-operative manufacturing sugar;\n(d) in the absence of any such agreement as is referred to in (a) or (b) the arrangements existing before the conclusion of any contract between a manufacturer and sellers, provided the sellers who accept the arrangement supply at least 60 % of the total beet bought by the manufacturer for the manufacture of sugar in one or more factories.", "1.
