whereas those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and in Article  1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in  which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted  (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86   (6); whereas Article 5 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 provides for the possibility of premiums  being granted to producers holding females of the ovine species of certain mountain breeds other  than eligible ewes in certain areas; whereas those ewes and those areas are defined in the Annex to  Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down the general rules for the granting  of premiums to sheepmeat producers  (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1970/87  (8);\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the Member States were  authorized by Regulation (EEC) No 1830/92  (9) to pay an initial advance and by Commission  Regulation (EEC) No 3249/92  (10) to pay a second advance to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers;  whereas the definitive premiums to be paid in respect of the 1992 marketing year must thus be  fixed;\nWhereas Article 23 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 provides for premiums to be paid per ewe and  per region; whereas the amount, payable to producers of heavy lambs in respect of the 1992  marketing year is obtained by multiplying the loss of income by a coefficient expressing the annual  average production of heavy lambmeat per ewe producing such lambs, expressed in terms of 100 kg  carcase weight, per region; whereas, in accordance with the abovementioned Regulation, the premium  per ewe for producers of light lambs and per female goat for the 1992 marketing year should be 80   % of the premium for producers of heavy lambs; whereas the amount for females of the ovine species  other than eligible ewes should be 70  % of the abovementioned premium;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 363/93 extends the period of application of the transitional  arrangements provided for in Article 24 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 for Ireland and Northern  Ireland despite the fact that the United Kingdom has abolished the variable slaughter premium;  whereas the premium payable per ewe applying in that area should therefore be determined;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the premium must be reduced by the  impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in Article 8 (2) of that Regulation;  whereas that coefficient was fixed provisionally by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1829/92 of 3  July 1992 on the application of the guarantee limitation arrangements for sheepmeat and goatmeat  for the 1992 marketing year  (11); whereas the lack of definitive statistics for the 1992 marketing  year means that the coefficient cannot be corrected at present; whereas a correction will be made,  where applicable, in the calculation of the premium for the 1993 marketing year in accordance with  the second indent of Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application from 1 July 1992 of specific  measures with regard to agricultural production in the Canary Islands; whereas those measures  involve the granting of a supplement to the premium payable to producers of light lambs and female  goats on the same terms as those laid down for the granting of the premium provided for in Article  5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89; whereas those terms provide for Spain to be authorized to pay the  supplement to the premium, calculated for the 1992 marketing year on a pro rata temporis basis;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1830/92 authorizes the Member States to pay the whole of the specific  aid for sheep and goat farming in certain less-favoured areas of the Community, introduced by  Council Regulation (EEC) No 1323/90  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 363/93; whereas  Regulation (EEC) No 3249/92 authorizes Spain to pay producers of sheep and goats located in certain  less-favoured areas of the Canary Islands the whole of the specific aid, calculated on a pro rata  temporis basis; whereas the abovementioned specific aid was increased by Regulation (EEC) No  363/93; whereas the amount already paid should therefore be considered an advance to be deducted  from the definitive amount;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["The following differences are hereby noted between the basic prices  less the impact of the coefficient provided for in Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and  the market prices during the 1992 marketing year for the following regions:\n>TABLE>", "The coefficient provided for in Article 23 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No  3013/89 shall be as follows:\n>TABLE>", "1.
