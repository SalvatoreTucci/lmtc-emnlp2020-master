Part C of that Annex sets out lists of Member States, zones and compartments declared disease-free in accordance with that Directive.\n(3) Denmark submitted to the Commission a multi-annual programme for the eradication of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) pursuant to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field\u00a0(3) for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. That programme was approved by Commission Decision 2008/897/EC of 28 November 2008 approving annual and multi-annual programmes and the financial contribution from the Community for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses presented by the Member States for 2009 and following years\u00a0(4). That programme complies with the requirements for approval laid down in Decision 2009/177/EC and should therefore be approved according to Article 44(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC. Accordingly, the zones covered by that programme should be inserted in Part B of the list set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(4) Article 12 of Decision 2009/177/EC provides for a derogation from Directive 2006/88/EC whereby Member States are not required to submit for approval eradication programmes that were approved for the purposes of obtaining approved zone status with regard to VHS by Commission Decision 2003/634/EC of 28 August 2003 approving programmes for the purpose of obtaining the status of approved zones and of approved farms in non-approved zones with regard to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) in fish\u00a0(5), subject to certain conditions.\n(5) Decision 2003/634/EC approved a programme submitted by Finland for the purpose of obtaining approved zone status with regard to VHS. Finland has now submitted a report on that programme in accordance with the requirements laid down in Decision 2009/177/EC. Accordingly, the zones covered by that programme should therefore be inserted in the list in Part B of Annex I to that Decision.\n(6) Germany submitted to the Commission a multi-annual programme for the eradication of koi herpes virus (KHV) disease pursuant to Decision 90/424/EEC. That programme was approved by Decision 2008/897/EC for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. That programme complies with the requirements for approval laid down in Decision 2009/177/EC and should therefore be approved according to Article 44(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC. Accordingly, the zones covered by that programme should be inserted in Part B of the list set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(7) The whole territory of the United Kingdom is currently listed in Part C of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC as declared disease-free in accordance with Directive 2006/88/EC as regards infectious salmon anaemia (ISA). The United Kingdom has notified the presence of ISA in a compartment previously declared free of that disease. Accordingly, the entry for that Member State as regards ISA should be amended in the list set out in Part C of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC.\n(8) The United Kingdom has now submitted for approval an eradication programme with regard to ISA to be applied in the South West Shetland Islands. That programme complies with the requirements of Decision 2009/177/EC. Accordingly, it should be approved and the South West Shetland Islands should be inserted in Part B of the list set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(9) Decision 2003/634/EC approved a programme submitted by the United Kingdom for the purpose of obtaining approved zone status with regard to VHS. The United Kingdom has now submitted a report on that programme in accordance with the requirements laid down in Decision 2009/177/EC in order to obtain a declaration of disease-free status for those zones. That report complies with the requirements of Decision 2009/177/EC. Accordingly, those zones should therefore be inserted in the list of Part C of Annex I to that Decision.\n(10) In addition, the whole coastline of Northern Ireland, except for Lough Foyle, is currently listed in Part C of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC as being declared disease-free as regards infection with Bonamia ostreae. The United Kingdom has now notified the presence of infection with Bonamia ostreae in Strangforth Lough on that coastline. Strangforth Lough should therefore be excluded from the territory declared disease-free in the list set out in Part C of Annex I to that Decision.\n(11) Decision 2009/177/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0328, 24.11.2006, p.\u00a014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a063, 7.3.2009, p.\u00a015.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a019.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0322, 2.12.2008, p.\u00a039.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0220, 3.9.2003, p.\u00a08.\nANNEX\nIn Annex I, Parts B and C are replaced by the following:\n\u2018PART B\nMember States, zones and compartments subject to approved eradication programmes\nDisease Member State ISO Code Geographical demarcation of the area under an eradication programme (Member State, zones or compartments)\nViral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) Denmark DK The following water catchments: Tim \u00c5, Hover \u00c5, Heager \u00c5, Velling \u00c5, Skjern \u00c5, Hemmet M\u00f8lle B\u00e6k, Lydum \u00c5, Konge\u00e5, Kolding \u00c5, Vejle \u00c5 and Holmsland Klit.\nFinland FI The Province of \u00c5land;\nInfectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN)\nKoi herpes virus (KHV) disease Germany DE Land Saxony\nInfectious salmon anaemia (ISA) United Kingdom UK South West Shetland Islands\nInfection with Marteilia refringens\nInfection with Bonamia ostreae\nWhite spot disease\nPART C\nMember States, zones and compartments declared disease-free\nDisease Member State ISO Code Geographical demarcation of the disease-free area (Member State, zones or compartments)\nViral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) Denmark DK The water catchment and the coastal areas of:\n\u2014 Hansted \u00c5\n\u2014 Hovm\u00f8lle \u00c5\n\u2014 Gren\u00e5\n\u2014 Tre\u00e5\n\u2014 Alling \u00c5\n\u2014 Kastbjerg\n\u2014 Villestrup \u00c5\n\u2014 Korup \u00c5\n\u2014 S\u00e6by \u00c5\n\u2014 Elling \u00c5\n\u2014 Uggerby \u00c5\n\u2014 Lindenborg \u00c5\n\u2014 \u00d8ster \u00c5\n\u2014 Hasseris \u00c5\n\u2014 Binderup \u00c5\n\u2014 Vidk\u00e6r \u00c5\n\u2014 Dybvad \u00c5\n\u2014 Bj\u00f8rnsholm \u00c5\n\u2014 Trend \u00c5\n\u2014 Lerkenfeld \u00c5\n\u2014 Vester \u00c5\n\u2014 L\u00f8nnerup med till\u00f8b\n\u2014 Fiskb\u00e6k \u00c5\n\u2014 Slette \u00c5\n\u2014 Bredk\u00e6r B\u00e6k\n\u2014 Vandl\u00f8b til Kilen\n\u2014 Resenk\u00e6r \u00c5\n\u2014 Klosterm\u00f8lle \u00c5\n\u2014 Hvidbjerg \u00c5\n\u2014 Knidals \u00c5\n\u2014 Spang \u00c5\n\u2014 Simested \u00c5\n\u2014 Skals \u00c5\n\u2014 Jordbro \u00c5\n\u2014 F\u00e5rem\u00f8lle \u00c5\n\u2014 Flynder \u00c5\n\u2014 Damhus \u00c5\n\u2014 Karup \u00c5\n\u2014 Guden\u00e5en\n\u2014 Halk\u00e6r \u00c5\n\u2014 Stor\u00e5en\n\u2014 \u00c5rhus \u00c5\n\u2014 Bygholm \u00c5\n\u2014 Grejs \u00c5\n\u2014 \u00d8rum \u00c5\nIreland IE All continental and coastal areas within its territory, except:\n1.
