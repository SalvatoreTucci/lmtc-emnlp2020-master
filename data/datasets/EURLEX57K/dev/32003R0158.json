The company concerned cannot currently benefit from Eastman's 0 % duty rate because it uses the name \"Voridian Company\", in the documents issued for the purpose of its exports of the product to the Community, thus the fact that it belongs to Eastman remaining undisclosed. Eastman is, however, the only legal entity producing the product for export to the Community, whereas \"Voridian company\" is merely an unincorporated division of it. Eastman therefore requested the Commission to change the name under which it is mentioned in the Regulation to \"Voridian Company, a Division of Eastman Chemical Co\".\n(3) The Commission reviewed all the information supplied, which satisfactorily demonstrates that all Eastman's activities linked to the manufacturing, sales and exports of the product have in fact remained unchanged since the outset of the investigation and that the requested change can be considered as a mere adaptation to an organisational set-up, which occurred after the period covered for the purpose of the investigation of dumping.\n(4) Consequently, the Regulation should be amended, with effect from its date of entry into force, by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual rates,", "main_body": ["Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
