A multiplexing system in the form of a central unit, consisting of three printed circuits equipped with a transformer and discrete and hybrid components and a series of sub-units. The multiplexing unit enables serveral different signals to be transmitted at the same time through the same cable. This system, which is fitted to civil aircraft to provide information and entertainment for passengers, allows each passenger to listen through his earphones to any one of several channels.\n2. An electronic multiplexing appliance in its own housing which enables multiple link-ups to be made between the different connection points of a computer network. It makes use of digital technology in order to concentrate data and to combine a number of data streams in a single data stream which is transmitted by line. Signals which are received on a single line are, in return, distributed to a number of output lines.\n3. A vehicle (length 180 cm, breadth 87 cm, height 100 cm) with a single-cylinder, four-stroke petrol engine (400 cm3 cylinder capacity), it consists essentially of a reinforced hopper with a 400 kg payload, and is equipped with manual tipping device and controls and rubber tracks. It has an unladen weight of 250 kg, a top speed of 6,8 km/h and develops 5,37 kw. The vehicle has three forward speeds and one in reverse. It is intended for transporting and dumping earth, sand, etc. mainly on building sites.\n4. A new vehicle (length 255 cm, breadth 108 cm, height 128 cm) with a single-cylinder, four stroke petrol engine (400 cm3 cylinder capacity), consisting essentially of a reinforced hydraulically-tippable flatbed with gates at the tail and either side, it has a payload of 800 kg, an open driving cab with controls and rubber tracks. It has a top speed of 8,7 km/h, four forward speeds and three in reverse, and develops 7,46 kw. It is intended for transporting and dumping earth, sand, etc. mainly on building sites.\n5. A stand-alone system which enables the operator to create images in two or three dimensions on a screen. It has no other function and cannot be programmed for applications other than computer-aided graphic design.\n\u2014 a processing unit, including a microprocessor, a graphics processor and a dedicated memory,\n\u2014 controls, such as a keyboard, mouse, programme function keys and graphic tablet,\n\u2014 a visual display unit (\u2018stereoscopic screen\u2019)."}
