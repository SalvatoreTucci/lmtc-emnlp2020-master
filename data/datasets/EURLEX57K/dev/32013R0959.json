By reason of the accession of Croatia, the threshold as well as the number of returning holdings for that new Member State should be fixed.\n(2) In addition, the date by which Croatia is to forward its first plan for the selection of returning holdings to the Commission needs to be laid down.\n(3) Structural change in Italy has led to a decrease in the number of the smallest holdings and in their contribution to the total output of agriculture, implying that those holdings do no longer need to be taken into account for the field of survey with a view to covering the most relevant part of the agricultural activity. In order to guarantee a more efficient representativeness of the Italian sample, the threshold for Italy should be adapted and the number of farms adjusted.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is amended as follows:\n(a) between the indents concerning France and Italy, the following indent is inserted:\n\u2018\u2014 : Croatia : EUR 4\u00a0000\u2019\n(b) the indent concerning Italy is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 : Italy : EUR 8\u00a0000\u2019\n(2) In the second paragraph of Article 5, the following sentence is added:\n(3) The Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nFor Croatia, it shall apply from the 2013 accounting year.\nFor Italy, it shall apply from the 2014 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 27.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 of 18 December 2009 concerning the selection of returning holdings for the purpose of determining incomes of agricultural holdings (OJ L 347, 24.12.2009, p. 14).\nANNEX\n(1) In the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009, the following row is inserted between the rows for France and Italy:\n\u2018860 CROATIA 1\u00a0251\u2019\n(2) The rows concerning Italy are replaced by the following:\n\u2018ITALY\n221 Valle D\u2019Aosta 170\n222 Piemonte 594\n230 Lombardia 717\n241 Trento 282\n242 Bolzano 338\n243 Veneto 707\n244 Friuli 451\n250 Liguria 431\n260 Emilia Romagna 873\n270 Toscana 577\n281 Marche 452\n282 Umbria 460\n291 Lazio 587\n292 Abruzzo 572\n301 Molise 342\n302 Campania 667\n303 Calabria 510\n311 Puglia 723\n312 Basilicata 400\n320 Sicilia 706\n330 Sardegna 547\nTotal Italy 11\u00a0106\u2019"}
