QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS\n(a) Standardized procedure for the use of the Instron Food Tester to determine the glutinosity of cooked rice\n1. Purpose\nThis method may be used for assessing the glutinosity of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester.\n2. Scope\nCooked wholly milled rice.\n3. Definitions\nThe following definitions apply for the purposes of this method.\n3.1. Glutinosity: tendency of cooked rice grains to adhere to each other.\n3.2. Wholly milled rice: as defined in paragraph 1 (d) of Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76.\n4. Principle\nMeasurement of the effort required to overcome the resistance to the separation of two plane surfaces of smooth steel between which some grains of cooked rice have been compressed with a given force for a given duration.\n5. Apparatus\n5.1. Instron Food Tester, operating, for compression and traction, at a constant speed of 0,5 cm/min, provided with a loading cell having a measuring range of 0 to 5 kg.\n5.2. Piston, adaptable to the loading cell of the Instron Food Tester (5.1), provided with a square smooth steel base.\n5.3. Smooth-surfaced steel plate placed axially in relation to the piston (5.2.) and firmly on the base of the Instron Food Tester.\n5.4. 25-ml beakers.\n5.5. Electric water bath provided with a non-airtight lid and a perforated plate on which the beakers (5.4) are placed. The level of water in the vessel must be such that, during boiling, it does not rise above the perforated plate.\n5.6. Balance, accurate to 0,1 grams\n5.7. Glass rod.\n5.8. Watch glasses, 6 cm in diameter.\n5.9. Timer.\n5.10. Spatula.\n5.11. Plastic bags or other recipients capable of containing 2 grams of cooked rice and preventing dehydration thereof.\n6. Procedure\n6.1. Heating of bath\nAdjust the temperature of the bath (5.5) so as to keep the water bubbling vigorously.\n6.2. Preparation for cooking\nFor each determination: prepare two beakers (5.4) by introducing into each a sample of 8 grams of wholly milled rice (entire grains only), weighed to within 0,1 grams, with 12 ml of distilled water. Stir gently with the glass rod (5.7), cover the  beakers with watch glasses (5.8).\n6.3. Cooking\nTake the lid off the cooking vessel, place the beakers on the perforated plate and quickly replace the lid. Switch on the timer (5.9). After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave everything undisturbed for 10 minutes. Remove the beakers from the  cooking vessel and invert them onto the watch glasses. Allow to cool for at least one hour.\n6.4. Adjustment of the Instron Food Tester\nAdjust the Instron Food Tester (5.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that the response of the loading cell corresponds to values between 0 and 640 grams and the speed to 0,5 cm/min.\n6.5. Measurement with the Instron Food Tester\nRemove the cooked rice from each beaker and, using the spatula (5.10), discard the extreme upper and lower layers. Prepare eight samples weighing 2 grams each, four from each beaker, weighed to within 0,1 grams, keeping them in the plastic bags (5.11)  until they are to be measured. Place one sample, axially in relation to the piston (5.2) on the steel plate (5.3), piling the rice as closely as possible without pressure. Cause the piston to descend at a constant speed of 0,5 cm/min, until the  compression force on the rice registers 640 grams. Stop the movement of the piston for 10 seconds then draw it back at the same speed.\nCalculate the area beneath the curve defined (on the ordinate) by the tractive force in grams and (on the abscissa) by the distance covered by the piston in cm during the phase in which a positive tractive force value was exerted. The area represents  the effort expressed in grams \u00d7 cm.\n7. Repeatability\nThe difference between the results of two determinations (two series of eight measurements) must not exceed 15 % of the mean value.\n(b) Standardized procedure for the use of the Instron Food Tester to determine the consistency of cooked rice\n1. Purpose\nThis method may be used for assessing the consistency of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester.\n2. Scope\nCooked wholly milled rice.\n3. Definitions\nThe following definitions apply for the purposes of this method.\n3.1. Consistency: resistance to mastication of cooked rice.\n3.2. Wholly milled rice: as defined in paragraph 1 (d) of Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76.\n4. Principle\nMeasurement of the effort required to extrude wholly milled cooked rice through a perforated plate.\n5. Apparatus\n5.1. Instron Food Tester, operating, for compression, at a constant speed of 10 cm/min.\n5.2. 50 cm2 model of the Ottawa texture measuring system cell, modified, if necessary, to reduce the section to 15 % of the original area, with a perforated plate insert.\n5.3. Piston, adaptable to the loading cell of the Instron Food Tester (5.1.).\n5.4. 100-ml tall beakers.\n5.5. Electric water bath, fitted with a non-airtight lid and a perforated plate on which the beakers (5.4) are placed. The level of water in the bath must be such that, during boiling, it does not rise above the perforated plate.\n5.6. Balance, accurate to 0,1 grams.\n5.7. Glass rod.\n5.8. Watch glasses, 6 cm in diameter.\n5.9. Timer.\n5.10. Spatula.\n5.11. Plastic bags or other recipients capable of containing 17 grams of cooked rice and preventing dehydration thereof.\n6. Procedure\n6.1. Heating of bath\nAdjust the temperature of the bath (5.5) so as to keep the water bubbling vigorously.\n6.2. Preparation for cooking\nFor each determination: prepare two beakers (5.4) by introducing into each a sample of 20 grams of wholly milled rice (entire grains only), weighed to within 0,1 grams, with 38 ml of distilled water. Stir gently with the glass rod (5.7), cover the  beakers with watch glasses (5.8).\n6.3. Cooking\nTake the lid off the bath, place the beakers on the perforated plate and quickly replace the lid. Switch on the timer (5.9). After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave everything undisturbed for 10 minutes. Remove the beakers from the bath and invert  them on to the watch glasses. Allow to cool to room temperature.\n6.4. Adjustment of the Instron Food Tester\nAdjust the Instron Food Tester (5.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that the response of the loading cell corresponds to values between 5 and 10 kg and the speed to 10 cm/min.\n6.5. Measurement with the Instron Food Tester\nRemove the cooked rice and prepare six samples weighing 17 grams each, three for each of the two beakers, weighed to within 0,1 grams, keeping them in the plastic bags (5.11) until they are to be measured. Place one sample in the Ottawa cell (5.2) and  cause the piston (5.3) to descend at a speed of 10 cm/min, recording continuously the effort required to extrude the sample of cooked rice.\nThe consistency of the sample is taken to be equal to the effort (in/kg) expressed by the mean value of the plateau of the extrusion curve.\n7. Repeatability\nThe difference between the results of two determinations (six measurements each) must not exceed 10 % of their mean value.\n(c) Amylose content\nDetermined according to ISO standard 6647.\nANNEX III\nLIST OF LABORATORIES  1.
