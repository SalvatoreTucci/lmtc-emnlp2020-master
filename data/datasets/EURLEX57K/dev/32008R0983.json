The plan should lay down in particular, for each of the Member States applying the measure, the maximum financial resources available to carry out its part of the plan, and the quantity of each type of product to be withdrawn from the stocks held by the intervention agencies.\n(2) The Member States involved in the plan for the 2009 budget year have supplied the information required in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92.\n(3) For the purposes of resource allocation, account must be taken of experience and of the degree to which the Member States used the resources allocated to them in previous years.\n(4) Point 1(c) of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 provides for the allocation of resources for the purchase on the market of products temporarily unavailable in intervention stocks. The stocks of cereals suitable for human consumption currently held by the intervention agencies are very low and measures have already been taken, regarding their sale on the market. Moreover, no stock of rice and skimmed milk powder is at present held by the intervention agencies and no offers of these agricultural commodities into intervention are foreseen for 2008. Therefore, resource allocations should be fixed to enable the purchase on the market of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice as required to implement the plan for the 2009 budget year.\n(5) Article 7(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 provides for the transfer between Member States of products unavailable in the intervention stocks of the Member State in which such products are required to implement the annual plan. Accordingly the intra-Community transfers necessary to implement the plan for 2009 should be authorised, subject to the conditions laid down in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92.\n(6) To implement the plan, the operative event within the meaning of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 should be the date on which the financial year for administration of stocks in public storage starts.\n(7) In accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, the Commission has consulted the major organisations familiar with the problems of the most deprived persons in the Community when drawing up the plan.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In 2009, the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be implemented in accordance with the
