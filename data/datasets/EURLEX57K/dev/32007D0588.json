It requires however for the part of Great Britain outside the surveillance zone to apply the same additional veterinary supervision and certification as in place for Northern Ireland since Decision 2007/554/EC was adopted.\n(7) In addition, restrictions on the movement of equidae and the requirement to expose vehicle tyres to disinfectant throughout the United Kingdom should be withdrawn.\n(8) The situation shall be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 11 September 2007, and the measures adapted where necessary.\n(9) Decision 2007/554/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/554/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
