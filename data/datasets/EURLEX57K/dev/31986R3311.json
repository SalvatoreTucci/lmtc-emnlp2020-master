Principle\nExpanded cut tobacco differs from non-expanded cut tobacco in that it is less dense.\n2. Equipment\n2.1. Chemicals:\nBenzyl acetate, d = 1,055,\nEthyl acetate, d = 0,898;\n2.2. Apparatus:\ntall beaker, 1000 ml, graduated, diameter approximately 95 mm,\nmagnetic stirrer,\nglass funnels, 15 cm diameter,\nround filter (coarse), diameter approximately 270 mm,\nglass Erlenmeyer flask, 1000 ml, wide-mouth,\nset of watch glasses, diameter approximately 10 cm,\nanalytical balance (indication in g, to two decimal places),\ndrying cabinet.\n3. Method\nFill a beaker to the 600 ml mark with benzyl acetate and place it on a vibration-free surface (e.g. a rigid table).\nDry about two g of tobacco to constant weight (for about three hours) in a drying cabinet at 85 \u00b0C (weighed-in portion = A). Determine in g, to two decimal places, the weight of the dried weighed-in portion.\nScatter the dried weighed-in portion (A) evenly over the surface of the liquid in the beaker and stir for 30 seconds with a magnetic stirrer.\nAllow to stand for two minutes, transfer the supernatant into a round filter, rinse twice with 50 ml of ethyl acetate and dry to constant weight (for about three hours) in a drying cabinet at 85 \u00b0C (supernatant after drying = B). Determine in g, to two decimal places, the weight of the dried supernatant.\n4. Calculation\nExpanded tobacco % =\nB \u00d7 100A\nwhere\nA = weighed-in portion in g to two decimal places,\nB = supernatant in g to two decimal places.\nThe average result of at least two determinations must be taken into account.\n--------------------------------------------------"}
