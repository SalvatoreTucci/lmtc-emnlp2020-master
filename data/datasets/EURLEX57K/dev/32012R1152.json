That report concluded that the access regime is very stable and that it has continued to operate satisfactorily since 2002.\n(4) Rules in place restricting access to fisheries resources within the 12 nautical mile zone have had positive effects on conservation by restricting fishing effort in the most sensitive part of Union waters. Those rules have also preserved traditional fishing activities which are important for the social and economic development of certain coastal communities.\n(5) The derogation entered into force on 1 January 2003 and is to expire on 31 December 2012. Its validity should be extended pending the adoption of a new regulation, based on the Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common fisheries policy.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the waters up to 12 nautical miles from baselines under their sovereignty or jurisdiction, Member States shall be authorised from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 to restrict fishing to fishing vessels that traditionally fish in those waters from ports on the adjacent coast.
