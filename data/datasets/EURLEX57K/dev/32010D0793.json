In its request, the Czech Republic specified that in its territory it is commercial practice that carcases can be presented without the flare fat being removed. This presentation that differs from the standard presentation should therefore be authorised in the Czech Republic.\n(4) In order to establish quotations for pig carcases on a comparable basis, this different presentation should be taken into account by adjusting the weight recorded in such cases in relation to the weight for standard presentation.\n(5) Decision 2005/1/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Decision 2005/1/EC the following Article 1a is inserted:\n\u2018Article 1a\nNotwithstanding the standard presentation laid down in the first paragraph of point B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, pig carcases in the Czech Republic may be presented without the flare fat having been removed before being weighed and graded.
