In order to ensure market supply, in particular in the new Member States, that Regulation fixed an additional quantity on a transitional basis over and above the quotas opened for imports of products originating in all third countries by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the same terms as regards tariffs, for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2004.\n(3) On a transitional basis, to allow the issue of import licences for a first instalment at the beginning of May 2004, Regulation (EC) No 838/2004 adopted the rules for the fixing of a provisional reference quantity for traditional operators and a provisional allocation for non-traditional operators. The purpose of this fixing was to allow the competent national authorities to make checks and verify the supporting documents submitted by operators, to correct declarations made under Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004\u00a0(4) or national provisions with the same objective adopted by the new Member States and to rectify, where necessary, the notifications referred to in Article 7(3) of that Regulation or provided for in national provisions to that end adopted by the new Member States in good time before the next instalment of the additional quantity was opened.\n(4) Once these controls have been carried out by the Member States in cooperation with the Commission, and on the basis of consolidated data notifications, provision should be made for the competent national authorities to fix, for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2004, the specific reference quantity for traditional operators or the specific allocation for non-traditional operators, as the case may be. In view of the difficulties encountered by traditional operators in obtaining copies of the required proof of release for free circulation in the country of destination, provision should be made for this specific reference quantity to be established on the basis of the supporting documents and documents provided for in Article 6(2) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 689/2004.\n(5) With a view to managing the additional quantity fixed in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 838/2004, the coefficients to be applied to the overall quantities notified by the Member States should be fixed, on the one hand, and provision should be made, on the other, for the adjustment coefficient to be applied by the competent authorities to the individual quantity for each operator to be fixed for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2004.\n(6) The quantity available for the issue of licences with a view to importing bananas into the new Member States in a second instalment from July 2004 should be fixed, and the rules for the submission of applications and for the issue of licences should be adopted.\n(7) The procedures for the management of the additional quantity for the last quarter of 2004 must be laid down.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 838/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. This Regulation must enter into force on the day of its publication in order to allow import licences to be issued in July 2004.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 838/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
