In accordance with the Framework Directive, Member States must guarantee the independence of national regulatory authorities by ensuring that they are legally distinct from and functionally independent of all organisations providing electronic communications networks, equipment or services. Member States that retain ownership or control of undertakings providing electronic communications networks and/or services must also ensure effective structural separation of the regulatory function from activities associated with ownership or control.\n(3) Detailed responsibilities and tasks of the national regulatory authorities differ among the various Member States, but all of them have at least one national regulatory authority who is charged with application of the rules once they have been transposed into national law, in particular the rules concerning day-to-day supervision of the market.\n(4) The need for the relevant rules to be consistently applied in all Member States is essential for the successful development of an internal market for electronic communications networks and services. The new regulatory framework sets out objectives to be achieved and provides a framework for action by national regulatory authorities, whilst granting them flexibility in certain areas to apply the rules in the light of national conditions.\n(5) A European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services (hereinafter referred to as the Group) should be established to provide an interface for advising and assisting the Commission in the electronic communications field.\n(6) The Group should provide an interface between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in such a way as to contribute to the development of the internal market. It should also allow cooperation between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in a transparent manner so as to ensure the consistent application in all Member States of the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.\n(7) The Group should serve as a body for reflection, debate and advice for the Commission in the electronic communications field, including on matters related to the implementation and revision of Recommendation on Relevant Product and Service Markets and in drawing up the Decision on transnational markets.\n(8) Close cooperation should be maintained between the Group and the Communications Committee established under the Framework Directive. The work of the Group should not interfere with the work of the Committee.\n(9) Coordination should be ensured with the Radio Spectrum Committee established under a Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision)\u00a0(5), the Radio Spectrum Policy Group established under the Commission Decision 2002/622/EC of 26 July 2002 establishing a Radio Spectrum Policy Group\u00a0(6) and the Television Without frontiers Contact Committee, created pursuant to Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7) on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nAn advisory group of the independent national regulatory authorities on electronic communications networks and services, called the European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services (hereinafter referred to as the Group), is hereby established.", "Definition\nFor the purpose of this Decision: \u2018relevant national regulatory authority\u2019 means the public authority established in each Member State to oversee the day-to-day interpretation and application of the provisions of the Directives relating to electronic communications network and services as defined in \u2018Framework\u2019 Directive.", "Aims\nThe role of the Group shall be to advise and assist the Commission in consolidating the internal market for electronic communications networks and services.\nThe Group shall provide an interface between national regulatory authorities and the Commission in such a way as to contribute to the development of the internal market and to the consistent application in all Member States of the regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.", "Membership\nThe Group shall be composed of the heads of each relevant national regulatory authority in each Member State or their representatives.\nThe Commission shall be represented at an appropriate level and shall provide the secretariat to the Group.", "Operational arrangements\nAt its own initiative or at the Commission's request the Group shall advise and assist the Commission on any matter related to electronic communications networks and services.\nThe Group shall elect a chairperson from among its members.
