The following subparagraph is inserted after the second subparagraph of Article 16 (4):\n\u00b4As regards sweet oranges, mandarins, satsumas and clementines:\n- the factor defined, for each product, for the varieties or types used for fixing the basic price shall be applied to all types or varieties of that product,\n- the factor defined for \"mixed sizings'' shall be applied whatever the size,\n- the factor defined for products \"in bulk in a means of transport'' shall be applied whatever the form of packaging.'\n2.
