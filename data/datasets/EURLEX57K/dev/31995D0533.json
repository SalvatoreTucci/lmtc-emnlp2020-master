ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\nAll the criteria detailed below must be achieved in order for a light bulb to qualify for an ecolabel.\nCriterion No 1: Energy efficiency\nThe criterion is set according to energy input (wattage).\nThe light output of a bulb must be equal to or greater than the following values:\n>TABLE>\nCriterion No 2: Mercury\nLamps should contain no more than 10 mg of mercury per lamp nor should they contain more than 1,4 mg of mercury per megalumen hour of light output.\nMercury content should be tested by the method described in the Appendix to this Decision.\nCriterion No 3: Packaging (1)\nLaminates and composite plastics must not be used. All cardboard packaging must contain a minimum of 65 % recycled material (by weight).\nB. FITNESS FOR USE CRITERIA\nCriterion No 4: Product information\n(i) Operation at low temperatures\nBulbs whose operation is impaired at low temperatures must be labelled to indicate that they are not suitable for external use at temperatures below 0\u00b0 C.\n(ii) Dimmer switches\nBulbs which do not operate on dimmer switches shall be labelled.\n(iii) Size and shape\nA pictogram should be used to illustrate the relative size and shape of a compact fluorescent bulb compared to a conventional incadescent bulb.\n(iv) Disposal\nInformation (pictogram or otherwise) to consumers on the packaging shall draw attention to the appropriate disposal conditions.\nCriterion No 5: Lifetime\nExpected lifetime must be &ge; 8 000 hours.\nIEC 64, IEC 357, IEC 901, IEC 969 test shall apply as appropriate for the type of bulb. For bulbs covered by IEC 969, if the lifetime test has not been completed, operational lifetime as stated by the manufacturers on the packaging is acceptable pending the result of the test. The result of the IEC 969 lifetime test must be communicated to be the competent body as soon as it is available, and in any case within no longer than 18 months from date of the application for the label.\nAppendix\nMETHOD TO TEST MERCURY CONTENT\nThe arc tube is first separated from its plastic surrounds and associated electronics. The associated leadwires are cut as close to the glass seal as possible. The arc tube is placed in a suitably sized robust screw capped plastic bottle to which is added a 1 inch diameter porcelain ball and 25 ml of high purity concentrated nitric acid (70%). The bottle is sealed and shaken for a few minutes to reduce the arc tube to fine particle size, the stopper is periodically loosened to eliminate any possibility of pressure build-up. The contents of the bottle are allowed to react for 30 minutes during which time the contents are periodically agitated.\nThe contents of the bottle are then filtered through an acid resistant filter paper and collected in a 100 ml graduated volumetric flask. Potassium dichromate is then added to the flask so that the final concentration is 1 000 ppm with respect to chromium. The flask is then made up to volume with pure water.\nMatched standards are made up on a concentration range up to 200 ppm mercury. The solutions are analysed using Flame Atomic Absorption at a wavelength of 253,7 nm with background correction on. From the results obtained and knowledge of the solution volume, the original mercury content of the light bulb can be computed.\nAdaptations to the details of the test method may be agreed by the competent body if they are necessary for technical reasons.\n(1) This criterion is provisional, pending the establishment of an overall approach for the inclusion of packaging aspects in eco-labelling criteria."}
