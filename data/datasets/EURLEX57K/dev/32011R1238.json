However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.\n(3) For the 2011/2012 marketing year, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2011\u00a0(3) fixed the quantitative limit for the exports at 650\u00a0000 tonnes in the case of out-of-quota sugar and at 50\u00a0000 tonnes in the case of out-of-quota isoglcuose. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2011 is to apply only as from 1 January 2012 and thus applications for export licences cannot be submitted before that date in respect of the quantitative limits fixed by that Regulation.\n(4) According to most recent estimates the production of out-of-quota sugar could increase considerably in marketing year 2011/2012 due to excellent weather conditions and increased sowing area. Production of out-of-quota sugar is expected to increase from 2\u00a0333\u00a0000\u00a0t in 2010/2011 to 4\u00a0920\u00a0000 tonnes in 2011/2012 and therefore additional market outlets for out-of-quota sugar should be ensured.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 of 7 May 2010 fixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2010/2011 marketing year\u00a0(4) fixed the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota isoglucose initially at 50\u00a0000 tonnes. In view of the strong export demand that quantity was increased to 65\u00a0000 tonnes by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 852/2011 of 24 August 2011 amending Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 as regards the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota isoglucose until the end of the 2010/11 marketing year\u00a0(5).\n(6) Taking into account that the WTO ceiling for exports in the 2011/2012 marketing year has not been fully used, it is appropriate to increase the export quantitative limit of out-of-quota sugar by 700\u00a0000 tonnes, to exploit all possible outlet for the product available. This measure will provide additional business opportunities for the Union sugar sector. Similarly, on the basis of the experience of the 2010/2011 marketing year, the quantitative limit for out-of-quota isoglucose exports should be increased by 20\u00a0000 tonnes. In order that Union manufacturers of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose can exploit market opportunities on their export markets and benefit from current high international prices it is appropriate to make available the increased quantities before 1 January 2012. To ensure good management of the market, applications for licenses for the 700\u00a0000 tonnes should be allowed as of 1 December 2011 whereas applications for licenses for the 650\u00a0000 tonnes should only be allowed as of 1 January 2012. Therefore, for the quantity of 700\u00a0000 tonnes it is necessary to provide for a derogation from Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1010/2011\u00a0(6).\n(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2011 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(a) 700\u00a0000 tonnes shall be available as from 1 December 2011; and\n(b) 650\u00a0000 tonnes shall be available as from 1 January 2012.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraph is added:\n(2) Article 2(1) is replaced by the following:\n(3) In Article 3, the second paragraph is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 December 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 1.7.2006, p. 24.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 102, 16.4.2011, p. 8.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 8.5.2010, p. 26.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 219, 25.8.2011, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 13.10.2011, p. 14.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 13.10.2011, p. 14.\u2027;"}
