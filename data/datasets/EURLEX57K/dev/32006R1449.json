The overrun of the processing threshold is assessed on the basis of the average quantities processed under the aid scheme during the three marketing years preceding the marketing year for which the aid is to be fixed, or during an equivalent period.\n(3) The Member States have communicated the quantities of oranges processed under the aid scheme in accordance with Article 39(1)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2111/2003\u00a0(2) which lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 2202/96. Based on this information, it has been established that the Community processing threshold has been overrun by 205\u00a0989 tonnes. Within that overrun, Italy and Portugal have overrun their threshold. The amounts of aid for oranges indicated in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for the 2006/07 marketing year should therefore be reduced by 28,63\u00a0% in Italy and 20,68\u00a0% in Portugal.\n(4) The Member States have communicated the quantities of small citrus fruits processed under the aid scheme in accordance with Article 39(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2003.

Within that overrun, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal have overrun their threshold. The amounts of aid for mandarins, clementines and satsumas indicated in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for the 2006/07 marketing year should therefore be reduced by 64,94\u00a0% in Italy, 36,52\u00a0% in Cyprus and 86,80\u00a0% in Portugal.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Where Italy and Portugal are concerned, and for the 2006/07 marketing year, the amounts of aid to be granted under Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for oranges delivered for processing shall be as indicated in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Where Italy, Cyprus and Portugal are concerned, and for the 2006/07 marketing year, the amounts of aid to be granted under Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for mandarins, clementines and satsumas delivered for processing shall be as indicated in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 49.
