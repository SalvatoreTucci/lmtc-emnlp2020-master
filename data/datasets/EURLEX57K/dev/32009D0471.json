On 29 October 2008 Mauritius requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information received from Mauritius the catches of raw tuna remain unusually low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Given that the abnormal situation in 2008 remains unchanged for 2009 a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(2) On 14 August 2008 Commission Decision 2008/691/EC\u00a0(3) was adopted granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Seychelles with regard to preserved tuna. On 18 December 2008 Seychelles requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information provided by Seychelles the catches of raw tuna remain very low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Given that the abnormal situation in 2008 remains unchanged for 2009 a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(3) On 18 September 2008 Commission Decision 2008/751/EC\u00a0(4) was adopted granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Madagascar with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins. On 10 December 2008 Madagascar requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information provided by Madagascar sourcing of raw originating tuna remains difficult due to their unavailability. Given that the abnormal situation in 2008 remains unchanged for 2009 a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(4) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC applied until 31 December 2008 because the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the eastern and southern Africa States on the one part and the European Community and its Member States on the other part (ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement) did not enter into force or was not provisionally applied before that date.\n(5) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations to them are to be superseded by the rules of the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement of which the entry into force or the provisional application is foreseen to take place in 2009.\n(6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the ACP countries to the Community as well as a smooth transition to the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be prolonged with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(7) Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar will benefit from an automatic derogation from the rules of origin for tuna of HS heading 1604 pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Origin Protocol attached to the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement signed by them, when this Agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied. It would be inappropriate to grant by this Decision derogations in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota granted to the ESA region under the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement. Therefore, it has been agreed to include a Joint Interpretative Declaration to the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement at the time of its signature reflecting the common understanding that the annual quotas provided in the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement are to be appropriately adjusted for the year 2009. Consequently the quota amounts for 2009 should be set at the same level as for 2008.\n(8) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/603/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
