The total assistance from the Structural Funds granted under the Single Programming Document amounts to EUR 17763000. The procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the Funds for the various priorities included in the Single Programming Document, is set out in the financing plan annexed to this Decision. Of that amount, EUR 3190000 will be suspended until the Commission adopts the decision to carry over those appropriations pursuant to the first indent of Article 7(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation.

Submission of the application for assistance, the programme complement or a request for payment by the Member State does not replace the notification required by Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\nCommunity financing of State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, requires prior approval by the Commission under Article 88(3) of the Treaty, except where the aid falls under the de minimis rule or is exempted under an exemption regulation adopted by the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 to certain categories of horizontal aid(2). In the absence of such exemption or approval, aid is illegal and subject to the consequences set out in the procedural regulation for State aid, and its part-financing would be treated as an irregularity within the meaning of Articles 38 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.\nConsequently, the Commission will not accept requests for interim and final payments under Article 32 of the Regulation for measures being part-financed with new or altered aid, as defined in the procedural regulation for State aid, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, until such aid has been notified to and formally approved by the Commission.\nBy way of derogation from the preceding paragraphs, Articles 51 and 52 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(3) shall apply in the context of rural development part financed by the EAGGF.", "The date from which expenditure shall be eligible is 1 January 2000.
