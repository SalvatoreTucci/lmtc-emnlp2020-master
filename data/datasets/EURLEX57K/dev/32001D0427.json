To this end, a study of the possibility of a programme financed by the Community was called for.\n(5) The European Union Strategy for the beginning of the new millennium on the prevention and control of organised crime(3) calls in Recommendation 6 for the Council to be assisted by suitably qualified experts on crime prevention, such as the national focal points, or by establishing a network of experts from national crime prevention organisations.\n(6) Several major seminars and conferences on crime prevention, most notably those held in Stockholm in 1996, in Noordwijk in 1997, in London in 1998 and in the Algarve in 2000 called for the establishment of a network within the European Union to develop cooperation on crime prevention. The High Level Conference in the Algarve also highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary, joint approach to crime prevention. The conference in Zaragoza in 1996 also pointed to this need in highlighting the strong links between organised crime and crime in general.\n(7) Society as a whole must be involved in the development of a partnership between national, local and regional public authorities, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and citizens. The causes of crime are multiple and must therefore be dealt with by measures at different levels, by different groups in society, in partnership with the players involved who have different powers and experience, including civil society.\n(8) Since the majority of the crimes of which citizens of the European Union are victims are committed in urban areas, urban policies must also be taken into consideration. In so doing, emphasis should be given to any kind of urban violence that affects the normal functioning of the community,", "main_body": ["1.
