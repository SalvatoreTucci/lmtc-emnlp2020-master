Regarding paragraph 5.3.2.4, the last subparagraph of 7.1.2.12, table 8 and figure 9 of standard EN 1495:1997 in particular, the Commission considers that the measures taken in designing and constructing the platform do not permit a high level of safety to be guaranteed for all foreseeable uses of the product.\n(6) In the interest of safety and legal certainty the publication of the references to that standard should be accompanied by an appropriate warning and Member States should add an identical warning in their national standards transposing standard EN 1495:1997.\n(7) The reference to standard EN 1495:1997 should be republished accordingly,", "main_body": ["The references of standard EN 1495:1997 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex.", "Where, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 98/37/EC, Member States publish the references of a national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 1495:1997, they shall add to that publication a warning identical to that provided for in the reference to standard EN 1495:1997 as set out in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 March 2003.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 331, 7.12.1998, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n(4) OJ L 217, 5.8.1998, p. 18.\n(5) OJ C 78, 13.3.1998, p. 2.\nANNEX\nPublication of titles and references of European harmonised standards under Directive 98/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n>TABLE>\nWarning:\nThis publication does not concern paragraph 5.3.2.4, the last subparagraph of 7.1.2.12, table 8 and figure 9 of standard EN 1495:1997, in respect of which it grants no presumption of conformity to the provisions of Directive 98/37/EC.\nNote:\nAny information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European standardisation organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to the Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(1).\nPublication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\nThe Commission ensures the updating of this list.\nFurther harmonised standards relating to machinery have been published in previous editions of the Official Journal of the European Union.
