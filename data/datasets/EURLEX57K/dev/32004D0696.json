For financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of that Regulation are to apply.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(3), lays down rules for monitoring and eradication of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.\n(4) In drawing up the lists of programmes for the eradication and the monitoring of TSEs qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community for 2005 and the proposed rate and maximum amount of the contribution for each programme, both the interest of each programme for the Community and the volume of available appropriations must be taken into account.\n(5) The Member States have supplied the Commission with information enabling it to assess the interest for the Community of providing a financial contribution to the programmes for 2005.\n(6) The Commission has considered each of the programmes from both the veterinary and the financial point of view and is satisfied that those programmes should be included in the lists of programmes qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005. The contribution for the monitoring of TSEs concerns the implementation of rapid tests, and for the eradication of TSEs, the destruction of animals found positive and the genotyping of animals.\n(7) In view of the importance of those measures for the protection of public and animal health, as well as the relatively recent introduction of those monitoring programmes compared with the traditional disease eradication programmes and the obligatory application of these programmes in all Member States, a high level of financial assistance from the Community should be ensured.\n(8) It is therefore appropriate to adopt the list of programmes qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005 and to set the proposed rate and the maximum amount of those contributions.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the monitoring of TSE (BSE and scrapie) listed in Annex I shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the eradication of BSE listed in Annex II shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex II.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the eradication of scrapie listed in Annex III shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex III.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 244, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
