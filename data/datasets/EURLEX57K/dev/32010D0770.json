Pursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, Decision 2009/980/EU included the following condition of use of that health claim: \u2018Information to the consumer that the beneficial effect is obtained with a daily consumption of 3\u00a0g WSTC I or 150\u00a0mg WSTC II in up to 250\u00a0ml of either fruit juices, flavoured drinks or yogurt drinks (unless heavily pasteurised)\u2019.\n(2) In that context, the applicant, Provexis Natural Products Ltd., submitted on 31 March 2010 an application for the modification of the authorisation of the relevant health claim pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. The modification concerns an extension of the conditions of use accompanying the authorised health claim, allowing in particular its use in food supplements.\n(3) The Authority was required to deliver an opinion on the modification of the conditions of use of the health claim as proposed by the applicant. On 23 July 2010, the Commission and the Member States received a scientific opinion from the Authority (Question No EFSA-Q-2010-00809)\u00a0(4) which concluded that on the basis of the data submitted, a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of WSTC I and II in food supplements, such as powder sachets, tablets and capsules, and the claimed effect.\n(4) Taking into account the scientific opinion of the Authority, and in order to extend the use of the health claim to foods other than those already authorised, it is therefore necessary to amend its conditions of use.\n(5) Decision 2009/980/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Decision 2009/980/EU, the text in the forth column (Conditions of use of the health claim), is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Information to the consumer that the beneficial effect is obtained with a daily consumption of 3\u00a0g WSTC I or 150\u00a0mg WSTC II in up to 250\u00a0ml of either fruit juices, flavoured drinks or yogurt drinks (unless heavily pasteurised) or with a daily consumption of 3\u00a0g WSTC I or 150\u00a0mg WSTC II in food supplements when taken with a glass of water or other liquid\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Provexis Natural Products Ltd., Thames Court, 1 Victoria Street, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 1YB, United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1101, 1-15.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 18.12.2009, p. 55.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2010); 8(7):1689."}
