(2)OJ No L 143, 1.7.1970, p. 1. (3)OJ No L 99, 5.5.1970, p. 20.\n28 April 1970 laying down special provisions for quality wines produced in specified regions, it applies also to the preparation of quality wines p.s.r.;\nWhereas the purpose of such notifications is to enable control to be kept over the processes in question ; whereas it is therefore necessary that, where the alcoholic strength is to be raised, the notifications should be sent to the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory the process is to be carried out, that they should be as specific as possible and that they should reach the competent authority before the process begins whereas, for acidification and deacidification, a subsequent control is sufficient ; whereas, for this reason and in order to reduce the amount of administrative work involved, provision should be made for the notifications to be made by the updating of registers regularly inspected by the competent authority;\nWhereas, for the control of these processes to be effective, it must extend to stocks of the products which are used ; whereas producers should therefore keep turnover registers and inform the competent authority of the quantities of the products which they hold when carrying out one of these processes;\nWhereas Member States should be responsible for such controls;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Wine;", "main_body": ["1.
