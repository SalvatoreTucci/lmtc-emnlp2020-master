Most producers must prepare their declarations at local support centres for farmers. As these centres must also simultaneously set up the electronic case-files for these declarations and update the area declarations and single payment scheme for the first year, it will not be possible to deal with all the producers' files by the deadline.\n(3) To resolve the problem, which is not the fault of the producers, and to avoid their being unjustly penalised, those producers should be granted an extension for the submission of harvest and production declarations.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001, for the 2005/06 wine year the declarations referred to in Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation may be submitted up to 25 January 2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 December 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
