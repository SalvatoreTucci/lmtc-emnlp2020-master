Those Member States should therefore be authorised to adopt the derogations in question.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to amend the Annexes to Decision 2005/263/EC.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the transport of dangerous goods set up under Article 9 of Directive 94/55/EC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/263/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

The waste is typically contained in packagings which have been sold in retail sale.\nIRELAND\nRO-SQ 7.4 (amended)\nSubject: Exemption from some of the provisions of the ADR on the packaging, marking and labelling of small quantities (below the limits in 1.1.3.6) of time-expired pyrotechnic articles of classification codes 1.3G, 1.4G and 1.4S of Class 1 of the ADR, bearing the respective substance identification numbers UN 0092, UN 0093, UN 0191, UN 0195, UN 0197, UN 0240, UN 0312, UN 0403, UN 0404 or UN 0453 for carriage to the nearest military barracks for disposal.\nReference to the Annex to the Directive: 1.1.3.6, 4.1, 5.2 and 6.1.\nContent of the Annex to the Directive: Disposal of out-of-date pyrotechnics.\nContent of the national legislation: The provisions of the ADR on the packaging, marking and labelling of expired pyrotechnic articles bearing the UN numbers UN 0092, UN 0093, UN 0403 or UN 0404 for carriage to the nearest military barracks do not apply provided the general packaging provisions of the ADR are complied with and additional information is included in the transport document.
