Those reductions corresponded, on the one hand, to amounts fixed in ecus and, on the other hand, to the amount for the protection of the industry referred to in Article 14(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organisation of the market in rice\u00a0(2).\n(2) Since the arrangement was adopted, numerous changes have been made to the applicable horizontal rules but Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90 has not been amended accordingly. The factors provided for in Article 1 of that Regulation for calculating the duties applicable to imports must be applied having regard to the horizontal rules concerned, which creates a risk of diverging interpretations.\n(3) More particularly, from 1 July 1995, variable import levies were converted into customs duties, following the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agriculture sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations\u00a0(3).\n(4) The concept of \u2018an amount for the protection of the industry\u2019 was abolished from 1 July 2006 by Council Regulation (EC) No 797/2006 of 22 May 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as regards the arrangements for importing rice\u00a0(4).\n(5) The switch-over mechanism introduced in 1984 in the Community agrimonetary system, the purpose of which was to prevent agricultural exchange rates from developing in line with monetary rates, was abolished on 1 February 1995 by Council Regulation (EC) No 150/95 of 23 January 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(5). When Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 was repealed from 1 January 1999 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro\u00a0(6), the prices and amounts provided for in the common agricultural policy (CAP) expressed in ecus were increased in parallel by applying a correcting factor of 1,207509, to cancel out the effects of bringing the conversion rates used under the CAP back to a realistic level, and the same coefficient of 1,207509 was therefore applied from 1 February 1995 to the amounts provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90 should therefore be amended to make it clear what factors are to be taken into account for calculating the import duties applicable to rice originating in Bangladesh imported under that Regulation,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
