According to this assessment, the rate of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme would be 9,9\u00a0% of the basic salary.\n(2) Under Article 2(1) of Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, the adjustment cannot lead to a contribution that is more than one percentage point above or below the valid rate of the previous year (11,6\u00a0%).\n(3) In the interests of actuarial balance of the pension scheme of Officials and other Servants of the Union, and taking into account the 2011 and 2012 actuarial assessments, the Council considers that the rate of contribution should be adjusted to 10,6\u00a0% of the basic salary.\n(4) However, in the light of recent and future judgments in the cases on the 2011 and 2012 adjustment of salaries and pensions and in the case on the 2011 adjustment of the rate of contribution to the pension scheme, the result of this adjustment may be subject to change. The implementation of those judgments may have an impact on the calculation of the rates of contribution for the years 2012 and 2013 and thus require the Council to re-adjust the said rates of contribution with retroactive effect.
