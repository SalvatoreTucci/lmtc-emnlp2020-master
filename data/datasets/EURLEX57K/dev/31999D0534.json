it also identified certain processes which were not effective;\n(4) The result of phase 2 of that study showed that only one system tested was capable of fully inactivating the scrapie agent in meat-and-bone meal;\n(5) It is therefore necessary to ensure that systems which have been shown to be ineffective are not used for the processing of mammalian animal waste in order to protect animals from the hazard of spongiform encephalopathy agents in animal feed, unless an effective sterilisation phase is added to the process;\n(6) At its meeting from 1 to 3 April 1996, the Council concluded that a Commission Decision should be adopted under the Standing Veterinary Committee procedure in order to require all animal waste of mammalian origin in the Community to be processed by a method that has been demonstrated as being de facto effective for the inactivation of the agents of scrapie and BSE; the only such method at present is the application of heat in a rendering system which achieves a minimum 133 \u00b0C at 3 bar for a minimum period of 20 minutes; that method may be applied as the sole process or as a pre- or post-process sterilisation phase;\n(7) The Scientific Steering Committee adopted an opinion on the safety of meat-and-bone meal from mammalian animals, naturally or experimentally susceptible to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) on 26 and 27 March 1998; that opinion has been updated by a scientific report on the safety of meat-and-bone meal derived from mammalian animals fed to non-ruminant food-producing farm animals adopted by the Scientific Steering Committee on 24 and 25 September 1998;\n(8) It is necessary to define the maximum particle size and the minimum time and temperature to be applied in approved systems, in order to ensure that such systems are running in accordance with procedures which have been shown to be effective;\n(9) Specific rules should be laid down on controls on establishments;\n(10) On 12 December 1994 the Scientific Veterinary Committee recommended detailed procedures for the validation of rendering processes; pending a scientific review of those procedures, it is necessary to lay down a list of indicators based, where appropriate, on that scientific recommendation, to be used for the validation of rendering processes in order to ensure that the parameters laid down in this Decision are achieved on a plant-by-plant basis;\n(11) Commission Decision 96/449/EC of 18 July 1996 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents(4) provided that, from 1 April 1997, certain mammalian animal waste which had not been processed in accordance with the standards set out therein should not be fed to animals; recent Community inspections have revealed that there are problems of implementation of that Decision due to difficulties of legal interpretation;\n(12) The Scientific Steering Committee adopted an opinion on the safety of tallow derived from ruminant tissues on 26 and 27 March 1998; in order to take account of that scientific opinion, it is necessary to lay down requirements for the production of rendered fats derived from ruminant tissue; a period of time should be provided for the implementation of those requirements;\n(13) A revision of the Animal Health Code of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) on BSE was adopted in the general assembly of the OIE in Paris on 29 May 1998; Article 3.2.13.3 of that Code recommends that if protein-free tallow (maximum level of impurities of 0,15 % in weight) is derived from healthy animals, veterinary administrations should be able to authorise, without restriction, its import and transit through their territories, regardless of the status of the exporting countries; Article 3.12.13.16 of that Code recommends sourcing and processing conditions which are to be complied with before tallow (other than protein-free tallow) and tallow derivatives (other than protein-free tallow derivatives) can be traded;\n(14) Special uses of animal waste may be exempted from the requirements of this Decision; furthermore, products which will be used for industrial purposes, where it can be assured that they will not be used in any animal feed chain or as fertilisers, may also be exempted from the requirements of this Decision;\n(15) A fundamental reworking of Decision 96/449/EC therefore appears necessary; in the interests of clarity, that Decision should be replaced;\n(16) Commission Decision 97/735/EC of 21 October 1997 concerning certain protection measures with regard to trade in certain types of mammalian animal waste(5) should be amended to take account of the provisions of this Decision;\n(17) This Decision should apply without prejudice to Council Decision 98/256/EC(6), and Commission Decision 98/653/EC(7), which lay down specific conditions for the production of amino acids, peptides, tallow and products derived from tallow in the United Kingdom and Portugal;\n(18) This Decision should be without prejudice to the adoption of rules for the organisation of the prevention and control of TSEs;\n(19) The Commission has, by Decision 97/534/EC(8), prohibited the use of material presenting risks as regards TSEs;\n(20) The Commission has, by Decision 98/272/EC(9), laid down measures to be applied in cases of animals suspected of having a TSE;\n(21) The Standing Veterinary Committee has not given a favourable opinion,", "main_body": ["1.
