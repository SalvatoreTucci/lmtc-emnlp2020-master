In particular, Annex I thereto sets levels for lead, cadmium and mercury in certain fishery products.\n(3) It is essential, in order to protect public health, to keep contaminants at levels which are toxicologically acceptable. Maximum levels for lead, cadmium and mercury must be safe and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) based upon good manufacturing and agricultural/fishery practices. On the basis of new analytical data it is necessary to revise the relevant provisions of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 for these contaminants in certain fishery products. The revised provisions maintain a high level of consumer health protection.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 5 April 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 77, 16.3.2001, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 321, 6.12.2001, p. 1.\nANNEX\nSection 3 (Heavy metals) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n(a) concerning lead (Pb), the points 3.1.4, 3.1.4.1 and 3.1.6 are replaced by the following: >TABLE>\n(b) concerning cadmium (Cd), the points 3.2.5, 3.2.5.1 and 3.2.6 are replaced by the following: >TABLE>\n(c) concerning mercury (Hg), the point 3.3.1.1 is replaced by the following: >TABLE>\n(1) Where fish are intended to be eaten whole, the maximum level shall apply to the whole fish.\n(2) Where fish are intended to be eaten whole, the maximum level shall apply to the whole fish."}
