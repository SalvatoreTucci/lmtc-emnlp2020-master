whereas an equal month is presumed to have 30,41666 days;\nWhereas it is desirable that consumers should be able to recognize the terms used different Member States to indicate the 'annual percentage rate of charge`;\nWhereas it is appropriate to study without delay to what extent a further degree of harmonization of the cost elements of consumer credit is necessary in order to put the European consumer in a position to make a better comparison between the actual percentage rates of charges offered by institutions in the various Member States, thereby ensuring harmonious functioning of the internal market,", "main_body": ["Directive 87/102/EEC shall be amended as follows:\n(a) Article 1a(1)(a) shall be replaced by the following:\n- in the Greek language version of the Directive:\n'\u00d4\u00ef \u00f3\u00f5\u00ed\u00ef\u00eb\u00e9\u00ea\u00fc \u00e5\u00f4\u00de\u00f3\u00e9\u00ef \u00f0\u00f1\u00e1\u00e3\u00ec\u00e1\u00f4\u00e9\u00ea\u00fc \u00f0\u00ef\u00f3\u00ef\u00f3\u00f4\u00fc \u00e5\u00f0\u00e9\u00e2\u00dc\u00f1\u00f5\u00ed\u00f3\u00e7\u00f2 \u00f0\u00ef\u00f5 \u00e5\u00ee\u00e9\u00f3\u00fe\u00ed\u00e5\u00e9 \u00f3\u00e5 \u00e5\u00f4\u00de\u00f3\u00e9\u00e1 \u00e2\u00dc\u00f3\u00e7 \u00f4\u00e9\u00f2 \u00f0\u00e1\u00f1\u00ef\u00fd\u00f3\u00e5\u00f2 \u00e1\u00ee\u00df\u00e5\u00f2 \u00f4\u00ef\u00f5 \u00f3\u00f5\u00ed\u00fc\u00eb\u00ef\u00f5 \u00f4\u00f9\u00ed \u00f4\u00f1\u00e5\u00f7\u00ef\u00f5\u00f3\u00fe\u00ed \u00de \u00ec\u00e5\u00eb\u00eb\u00ef\u00ed\u00f4\u00e9\u00ea\u00fe\u00ed \u00f5\u00f0\u00ef\u00f7\u00f1\u00e5\u00fe\u00f3\u00e5\u00f9\u00ed (\u00e4\u00e1\u00ed\u00e5\u00df\u00f9\u00ed, \u00e5\u00ee\u00ef\u00f6\u00eb\u00de\u00f3\u00e5\u00f9\u00ed \u00ea\u00e1\u00e9 \u00e5\u00f0\u00e9\u00e2\u00e1\u00f1\u00fd\u00ed\u00f3\u00e5\u00f9\u00ed) \u00f0\u00ef\u00f5 \u00dd\u00f7\u00ef\u00f5\u00ed \u00e1\u00ed\u00e1\u00eb\u00e7\u00f6\u00e8\u00e5\u00df \u00e1\u00f0\u00fc \u00f4\u00ef \u00e4\u00e1\u00ed\u00e5\u00e9\u00f3\u00f4\u00de \u00ea\u00e1\u00e9 \u00f4\u00ef (\u00e4\u00e1\u00ed\u00e5\u00e9\u00e6\u00fc\u00ec\u00e5\u00ed\u00ef) \u00ea\u00e1\u00f4\u00e1\u00ed\u00e1\u00eb\u00f9\u00f4\u00de, \u00f5\u00f0\u00ef\u00eb\u00ef\u00e3\u00df\u00e6\u00e5\u00f4\u00e1\u00e9 \u00f3\u00fd\u00ec\u00f6\u00f9\u00ed\u00e1 \u00ec\u00e5 \u00f4\u00ef \u00ec\u00e1\u00e8\u00e7\u00ec\u00e1\u00f4\u00e9\u00ea\u00fc \u00f4\u00fd\u00f0\u00ef \u00f0\u00ef\u00f5 \u00f0\u00e1\u00f1\u00e1\u00f4\u00df\u00e8\u00e5\u00f4\u00e1\u00e9 \u00f3\u00f4\u00ef \u00f0\u00e1\u00f1\u00dc\u00f1\u00f4\u00e7\u00ec\u00e1 \u00c9\u00c9.`,\n- in the English language version of the Directive:\n'The annual percentage rate of charge which shall be that rate, on an annual basis which equalizes the present value of all commitments (loans, repayments and charges), future or existing, agreed by the creditor and the borrower, shall be calculated in accordance with the mathematical formula set out in Annex II.`;\n(b) Article 1a(3) shall be deleted;\n(c) Article 1a(5) shall be deleted;\n(d) Article 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n'Without prejudice to Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising (*), and to the rules and principles applicable to unfair advertising, any advertisement, or any offer which is displayed at business premises, in which a person offers credit or offers to arrange a credit agreement and in which a rate of interest or any figures relating to the cost of the credit are indicated, shall also include a statement of the annual percentage rate of charge, by means of a representative example if no other means is practicable.\n(*) OJ L 250, 19.9.1984, p. 17.
