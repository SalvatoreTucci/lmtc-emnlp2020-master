Consequently, a significant number of Community vessels that operated within this framework were forced to stop their fishing activities at that date.\n(2) The fishermen and owners of the vessels concerned benefited in this connection from the allowances provided for in Article 16(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999(4) with the assistance of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), under the derogation conditions laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1227/2001(5).\n(3) It is justified to encourage, by appropriate measures at the Community level, the implementation of the conversion plans of the fleets concerned as approved by the Commission on 18 October 2000.\n(4) It is necessary to facilitate the permanent cessation activity of the vessels, whether by demolition or by transfer to a third country, including within the framework of joint enterprises. It is also appropriate to facilitate the replacement of fishing gear for the permanent conversion towards other fishing activities, whatever the age of the vessel and even if it were the subject of public aid for construction.\n(5) Consequently, there is a need for derogations from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.\n(6) Moreover, in the spirit of the conclusions of the European Council of Nice, the European Union should signal its solidarity with the Member States concerned, by means of an additional financial effort, over and above the amounts made available inside heading 2 of the financial perspectives for the budget of the European Union, as fixed at the European Council of Berlin on 25 March 1999.\n(7) Consequently, a specific measure of the Community should be instituted to execute the appropriations in question in order to implement part of the conversion plans, on the understanding that the other parts of the aforementioned plans will have to be carried out with the assistance of FIFG appropriations.\n(8) The complementary appropriations available should be devoted to the specific measure, on the one hand to the restructuring of the fleet, and on the other hand to the fishermen's early retirement or retraining, away from sea fishing, under individual or collective social plans.\n(9) The specific measure must be consistent with the general principles of the structural policy in the fisheries sector. In particular, distortions must be avoided with the provisions in force for the implementation of the FIFG appropriations. An operational mechanism of management must also be envisaged as close as possible to that in force for the Community Structural Funds, as fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(6).\n(10) The vessels due to operate in international waters or in waters of third countries must fully respect international law with regard to the conservation of fishing resources and in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of Seas as well as the Code of Conduct of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.\n(11) The socio-economic diversification of the coastal areas dependent on fishing naturally fits into the context of the integrated operational regional development programmes and multi-regional programmes arising from the Community support frameworks of the Objective 1 of the Structural Funds for Spain and for Portugal, with the financial assistance of the European Regional Development Fund, of the European Social Fund and of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section. Under these conditions, it is not justified to envisage a specific intervention devoted to this diversification,", "main_body": ["1.
