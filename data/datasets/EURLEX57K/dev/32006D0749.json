However, for the 2005/2006 import season the entry into the Community of such tubers was permitted from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 and subject to specific conditions.\n(2) During the 2005/2006 import season, a small number of interceptions of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith were recorded.\n(3) Egypt has submitted a report into the causes of these interceptions. That report details further stricter measures which have been taken by Egypt as regards the \u2018pest free areas\u2019 and exporters involved in those interceptions. Certain areas have been taken off the list of \u2018pest free areas\u2019 for the 2006/2007 import season. Two of the exporters involved have been formally warned and one exporter has been banned from exporting in the 2006/2007 season.\n(4) In the light of the information provided by Egypt, the Commission has established that there is no risk of spreading Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith with the entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt, provided that specific conditions are satisfied.\n(5) The entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L., originating in \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 of Egypt, should therefore be permitted for the 2006/2007 import season.\n(6) Decision 2004/4/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/4/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
