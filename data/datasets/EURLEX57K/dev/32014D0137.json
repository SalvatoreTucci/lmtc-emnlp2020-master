Rather, Greenland, being a part of a Member State, is associated to the Union as one of the overseas countries and territories (OCTs).\n(2) In its preamble, the Greenland Treaty states that arrangements should be introduced which permit close and lasting links between the Union and Greenland to be maintained and mutual interests, notably the development needs of Greenland, to be taken into account, and that the arrangements applicable to OCTs set out in Part Four of the TFEU provide an appropriate framework for those relations.\n(3) In accordance with Article 198 TFEU, the purpose of association is to promote the economic and social development of the OCTs and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole. Pursuant to Article 204 TFEU, the provisions of Articles 198 to 203 TFEU apply to Greenland, subject to the specific provisions set out in Protocol (No 34) on special arrangements for Greenland annexed to the TFEU.\n(4) The provisions for the application of the principles laid down in Articles 198 to 202 TFEU are set out in Council Decision 2013/755/EU\u00a0(3).\n(5) In its conclusions of 24 February 2003 on the Mid-term Review of the Fourth Fisheries protocol between the European Community, the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, and recognising the geostrategic importance of Greenland to the Union and the spirit of cooperation resulting from the Union\u2019s decision to grant the status of overseas territory to Greenland, the Council agreed that there was a need to broaden and strengthen future relations between the Union and Greenland, taking into account the importance of fisheries and the need for structural and sectoral orientated reforms in Greenland. The Council further expressed its commitment to base the future relationship of the Union with Greenland after 2006 on a comprehensive partnership for sustainable development which would include a specific fisheries agreement, negotiated according to the general rules and principles for such agreements.\n(6) The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland on the other hand\u00a0(4), concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 753/2007\u00a0(5), recalls the spirit of cooperation resulting from the decision to grant the status of overseas territory to Greenland.\n(7) The Joint Declaration of the European Community, on the one hand, and the Home Rule Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark, on the other, on partnership between the European Community and Greenland, signed in Luxembourg on 27 June 2006, recalled the close historical, political, economic and cultural connections between the Union and Greenland and emphasised the need to strengthen further their partnership and cooperation.\n(8) The relations between the Union on the one hand, and Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark on the other, are governed, inter alia, by Council Decision 2006/526/EC\u00a0(6), which expired on 31 December 2013.\n(9) The Union needs to build comprehensive partnerships with new actors on the international scene in order to promote a stable and inclusive international order, to pursue common global public goals and to defend core Union interests, as well as to increase knowledge of the Union in third countries and OCTs.\n(10) The partnership pursuant to this Decision should allow for the continuation of strong relations between the Union on the one hand, and Greenland and Denmark on the other, and should respond to global challenges, allowing for the development of a proactive agenda and the pursuit of mutual interests. The partnership should also be linked to the objectives outlined in the Commission Communication of 3 March 2010 entitled \u2018Europe 2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019 (the \u2018Europe 2020 strategy\u2019), thus providing consistency with the Europe 2020 strategy and the promotion of internal policies and objectives defined in Commission Communications, such as the Commission Communication of 2 February 2011 entitled \u2018Tackling the Challenges in Commodity Markets and on Raw Materials\u2019, and facilitating cooperation in the context of the Union's Arctic policy.\n(11) Union financial assistance should focus on areas where it has most impact, having regard to its capacity to act on a global scale and to respond to global challenges such as poverty eradication, sustainable and inclusive development or the worldwide promotion of democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law, its long-term and predictable engagement in development assistance and its role in coordinating with its Member States.\n(12) The partnership pursuant to this Decision should provide for a framework permitting regular discussions on matters of interest for the Union or for Greenland, such as global issues, where an exchange of views, and a possible convergence of ideas and opinions, could be beneficial for both parties. In particular, the increasing impact of climate change on human activity and the environment, maritime transport, natural resources, including raw materials, as well as research and innovation, calls for dialogue and enhanced cooperation.\n(13) Union financial assistance, allocated through the partnership, should bring a European perspective to the development of Greenland and should contribute to the strengthening of the close and long lasting ties with it, while strengthening the position of Greenland as an advanced outpost of the Union, based on the common values and history which links the partners.\n(14) Union financial assistance for the period 2014-2020 should focus on one, or a maximum of two, areas of cooperation, allowing for the partnership\u2019s impact to be maximised and to further allow for economies of scale, synergy effects, greater effectiveness and visibility of the Union's actions.\n(15) The cooperation pursuant to this Decision should ensure that resource flows are accorded on a predictable and regular basis and are flexible and tailored to the situation in Greenland. To this end, budget support should be used wherever feasible and appropriate.\n(16) The financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union are laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7), and in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012\u00a0(8).\n(17) The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including through prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, penalties. Those measures should be carried out in accordance with the applicable agreements concluded with international organisations and third countries.\n(18) The programming documents and financing measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by means of implementing acts in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(9). Given the nature of those implementing acts, in particular their policy orientation nature and their financial implications, the examination procedure should in principle be used for their adoption, except in the case of technical implementing measures of a small financial scale.\n(19) Common rules and procedures for the implementation of the Union's instruments for financing external action, laid down in Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(10), should apply to the implementation of this Decision, as appropriate.\n(20) It is appropriate to ensure a smooth transition without interruption between Decision 2006/526/EC and this Decision and to align the period of application of this Decision with that of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013\u00a0(11).
