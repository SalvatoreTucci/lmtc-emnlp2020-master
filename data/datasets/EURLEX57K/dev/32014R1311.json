A pre-requisite for the invocation of the spatial data services is the ability to access the relevant information. The Member States through the discovery services mandated in Directive 2007/2/EC, with rules for implementation in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009, are making available the metadata elements mandated by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008\u00a0(3). The implementing rules for spatial data services in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010\u00a0(4) introduces new metadata elements for spatial data services, consequently the definition of a metadata element in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 needs to be updated to allow for the discovery and availability of the new metadata elements with the Member States discovery services.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 22 of Directive 2007/2/EC,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 point 7 is replaced by the following:\n\u20187. \u201cINSPIRE metadata element\u201d means a metadata element set out in Part B of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01205/2008 or in Part B of Annex V, Part B of Annex VI and Part B of Annex VII to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010\u00a0(5).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 25.4.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 of 19 October 2009 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the Network Services (OJ L\u00a0274, 20.10.2009, p.\u00a09).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 of 3 December 2008 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata (OJ L\u00a0326, 4.12.2008, p.\u00a012).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services (OJ L\u00a0323, 8.12.2010, p.\u00a011).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services (OJ L\u00a0323, 8.12.2010, p.\u00a011).\u2019"}
