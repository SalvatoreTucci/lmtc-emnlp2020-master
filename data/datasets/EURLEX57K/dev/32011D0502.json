That objective is to be achieved by preventing and combating crime, organised and other, including trafficking in human beings and crimes against children.\n(2) According to Article 5(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, trafficking in human beings is prohibited.\n(3) Trafficking in human beings, as defined in Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA\u00a0(1), is a serious crime comprising violations of fundamental human rights and human dignity and requiring a multi-disciplinary approach across the entire trafficking chain, encompassing countries of origin, transit and destination alike.\n(4) On 25 March 2003, by Decision 2003/209/EC\u00a0(2), the Commission decided to set up a consultative group known as the \u2018Experts Group on Trafficking in Human Beings\u2019. By Decision 2007/675/EC\u00a0(3), the Commission repealed the Decision of 25 March 2003 and set up a new consultative group, the Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings, which has contributed substantively to the prevention of and the fight against trafficking in human beings and enabled the Commission to gather opinions about initiatives relating to trafficking in human beings. Following the expiry of the 3-year period of validity of Decision 2007/675/EC, it has to be repealed and replaced.\n(5) In the light of the valuable work carried out by both expert groups since 2003 that has enabled the Commission to further develop its policy in this area, and taking into account the increasing importance at global level of the policy on trafficking in human beings, there is a continuing need for a group of experts.\n(6) A new group of experts should continue to advise the Commission, taking into account recent developments at EU level. These include, the adoption of Directive 2011/36/EU; the appointment of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator; the Action-Oriented Paper on strengthening the EU external dimension on action against trafficking in human beings, of 30 November 2009.\n(7) The group should be composed of 15 members representing a wide range of expertise in all the aspects of anti-trafficking policies and also a balanced representation in terms of institutional background and geographic regions.\n(8) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be laid down.\n(9) Personal data relating to members of the group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4).\n(10) The term of office of the members should be 4 years and should be renewable.\n(11) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension.\n(12) Decision 2007/675/EC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the group\u2019, is hereby established.", "Tasks\nThe group\u2019s tasks shall be\u00a0(5):\n(a) to advise the Commission on matters related to trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims by issuing written contributions, as appropriate and agreed with the Commission, and ensuring a coherent approach to the subject;\n(b) to help the Commission to assess the evolution of policy in the field of trafficking in human beings at national, European and international levels;\n(c) to assist the Commission in identifying and defining possible relevant measures and actions at national, European and international level across the range of the anti-trafficking policies;\n(d) to provide a forum for discussion on matters related to trafficking in human beings and bring about exchanges of experience.", "Consultation\nThe Commission may consult the group on any matter relating to trafficking in human beings.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The group shall be composed of 15 members.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The members of the group shall be individuals with expertise and experience in the prevention and the fight against trafficking in human beings and protection of its victims.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the group shall reflect the balance of expertise required on the different forms of trafficking as well as the various aspects involved, such as, but not limited to labour, healthcare, law enforcement, migration, victims support, development cooperation, gender, children, fundamental rights and education.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members of the group must be nationals of a Member State of the European Union or, if appropriate, of a candidate or potential candidate country or a European Economic Area country.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members are appointed by the Director-General of DG Home Affairs from among those who have responded to the call for applications (see Annex to the present Decision).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of the call for applications, applicants who were deemed suitable candidates for group membership but were not appointed should be placed on a reserve list, with their consent.
