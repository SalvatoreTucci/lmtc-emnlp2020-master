These electrodes are used when wide-range conductivity measurements are required or for measuring conductivity under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions. Both the substitution or elimination of lead in PPEs and the substitution of PPEs with other types of electrodes are scientifically and technically impracticable under these conditions.\n(3) The use of lead in PPEs for wide-range conductivity measurements or for measuring conductivity under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions should therefore be exempted from the prohibition until 31 December 2018. This transition period is necessary for research and unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
