However, Article 230(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that, as regards the system of milk production limitation, Section III of Chapter III of Title I of Part II of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as well as Article 55, Article 85 thereof and Annexes IX and X thereto continue to apply until 31 March 2015.\n(2) Article 67(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that producers may have one or two individual quotas, one for deliveries and the other for direct sales and quantities may be converted from one quota to the other only by the competent authority of the Member State, at the duly justified request of the producer.\n(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 341/2013\u00a0(3) sets out the division between deliveries and direct sales for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 for all Member States.\n(4) In accordance with Article 25(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2004\u00a0(4), Member States have notified to the Commission the quantities which have been definitively converted at the request of the producers between individual quotas for deliveries and for direct sales.\n(5) The total national quotas for all Member States fixed in point 1 of Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 were increased with 1\u00a0%, effective from 1 April 2013, except for Italy whose quota was already increased with 5\u00a0%, effective from 1 April 2009. Member States, except Italy, have notified the Commission of the division between deliveries and direct sales of the additional quota.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to establish the division between deliveries and direct sales of the national quotas applicable for the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 fixed in point 1 of Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 69(1) in conjunction with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the Commission had to act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195(2) of that Regulation, The corresponding procedure under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2) of that Regulation.\n(8) Given the fact that the division between direct sales and deliveries is used as a reference basis for controls pursuant to Articles 19 to 22 of Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 and for the establishment of the annual questionnaire set out in Annex I to that Regulation, it is appropriate to determine a date of expiry of this Regulation after the last possible date for those controls.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The division, applicable for the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014, between deliveries and direct sales of the national quotas fixed in Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall expire on 30 September 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 341/2013 of 16 April 2013 on the division between \u2018deliveries\u2019 and \u2018direct sales\u2019 of national milk quotas fixed for 2012/2013 in Annex IX to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (OJ L 107, 17.4.2013, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 of 30 March 2004 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector (OJ L 94, 31.3.2004, p. 22).\nANNEX\nMember States Deliveries (tonnes) Direct sales (tonnes)\nBelgium 3\u00a0563\u00a0518,754 38\u00a0596,156\nBulgaria 980\u00a0634,534 68\u00a0883,082\nCzech Republic 2\u00a0906\u00a0440,166 28\u00a0704,691\nDenmark 4\u00a0847\u00a0745,007 164,466\nGermany 30\u00a0228\u00a0356,043 90\u00a0572,707\nEstonia 686\u00a0868,079 6\u00a0057,970\nIreland 5\u00a0782\u00a0432,252 1\u00a0989,984\nGreece 878\u00a0297,757 1\u00a0317,000\nSpain 6\u00a0492\u00a0010,746 65\u00a0544,699\nFrance 26\u00a0027\u00a0402,340 343\u00a0828,937\nCroatia 698\u00a0513,437 66\u00a0486,563\nItaly 10\u00a0923\u00a0133,189 365\u00a0409,677\nCyprus 154\u00a0996,181 662,611\nLatvia 767\u00a0328,466 13\u00a0804,232\nLithuania 1\u00a0753\u00a0484,887 74\u00a0154,094\nLuxembourg 292\u00a0146,310 608,000\nHungary 1\u00a0967\u00a0812,833 165\u00a0591,689\nMalta 52\u00a0205,729 0,000\nNetherlands 11\u00a0971\u00a0575,644 78\u00a0917,011\nAustria 2\u00a0908\u00a0728,694 83\u00a0999,794\nPoland 9\u00a0909\u00a0800,752 145\u00a0996,304\nPortugal\u00a0(1) 2\u00a0080\u00a0100,794 8\u00a0803,752\nRomania 1\u00a0567\u00a0149,958 1\u00a0710\u00a0046,520\nSlovenia 597\u00a0475,443 20\u00a0697,937\nSlovakia 1\u00a0075\u00a0921,492 39\u00a0834,729\nFinland\u00a0(2) 2\u00a0615\u00a0010,522 4\u00a0818,381\nSweden 3\u00a0589\u00a0229,658 4\u00a0800,000\nUnited Kingdom 15\u00a0749\u00a0697,318 147\u00a0007,248\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Except Madeira;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The Finnish national quota as referred to in annex IX to Regulation(EC).
