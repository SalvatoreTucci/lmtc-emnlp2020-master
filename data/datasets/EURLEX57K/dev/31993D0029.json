whereas in the case of sawn wood, phytosanitary certificates are not generally issued in that country; whereas it appears that kiln-drying capacity is at present  limited in Canada;\nWhereas, in respect of Canada, the Commission has established, on the basis of the information available at present, that an officially approved and monitored programme of issuing certificates of debarking and grub-hole control has been set up to ensure  proper debarking and to reduce the risk from harmful organisms; whereas the risk of spreading harmful organisms is reduced provided that the wood is accompanied by a certificate of debarking and grub-hole control issued under that programme;\nWhereas by Commission Decisions 90/505/EEC (3), 91/635/EEC (4) and 92/13/EEC (5) the Commission authorized such derogations under technical conditions in respect of sawn wood of conifers originating in Canada, based on the use of the aforementioned  certificate of debarking and grub-hole control;\nWhereas, it has not been established, on the basis of available information, that there are elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned debarking and grub-hole control programme;\nWhereas Decision 92/13/EEC, stipulated that the authorization should expire on 31 December 1992;\nWhereas at present, proper kiln-drying is an effective measure to protect the Community against the introduction of certain organisms affecting wood of conifers; whereas, however, various kiln-drying schedules are commonly applied to different timber  species in order to dry them to a suitable level for end-use application; whereas these drying processes require the application of heat at various intensities and durations;\nWhereas a Community research programme has been set up to define parameters in the case of heat-treatment which ensure the eradiction of the Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and its vectors, in order to enable the Commission to lay down the permanent  requirements to safeguard against the spread of the said organisms;\nWhereas the results of that research have been the basis for amendment and revision of the relevant Annexes IV and V to the said Directive;\nWhereas, however, according to the provisions of Council Directive 91/683/EEC (6) Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive 91/683/EEC six months after the revisions of  Annexes I to V to Directive 77/93/EEC;\nWhereas it appears that the revision has been delayed;\nWhereas the authorization is applicable without prejudice to the abolition of the intra-Community border controls from 1 January 1993;\nWhereas the authorization should therefore be extended for a further limited period;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 90/505/EEC is hereby amended as follows:", "is replaced by:\n'The authorization granted in Article 1 shall apply for a period expiring on the deadline for implementation into national legislation of the modifications to Directive 77/93/EEC as referred to in Article 3 (1) in Directive 91/683/EEC, being the last  date of entry into the Community. It shall be revoked earlier if it is established that the conditions laid down in Article 1 (2) are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms or have not been complied with.'", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the  Republic of Portugal and the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 1992.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 26, 31. 1. 1977, p. 20.\n(2) OJ No L 363, 11. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 282, 13. 10. 1990, p. 63.\n(4) OJ No L 341, 12. 12. 1991, p. 32.\n(5) OJ No L 6, 11. 1. 1992, p. 47.\n(6) OJ No L 376, 31. 12. 1991, p. 29."}
