However, Annex II in principle only takes into account adaptations to acts adopted before the cut-off date for the accession negotiations, i.e. 1 November 2002.\n(2) It is however necessary to make additional adaptations to the acquis, in particular to acts adopted after that date as well as to acts which could not be included in Annex II or which, because of changed circumstances, require new adaptations.\n(3) Commission Directive 2001/32/EC of 8 May 2001 recognising certain protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community and repealing Directive 92/76/EC\u00a0(2), was amended on several occasions after 1 November 2002 in respect of certain provisions that were adapted by the Act of Accession of 2003.\n(4) In the interest of clarity it is appropriate to establish an updated complete list of such zones. Directive 2001/32/EC should, therefore, be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2001/32/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
