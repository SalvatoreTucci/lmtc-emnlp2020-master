ANNEX   RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN THE FIELD OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (1989 to mid-1993)  OBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of the programme are to contribute to Europe's competitiveness in the food industry, to the improvement of food safety and quality for the consumer and to the strengthening of food science and technology in Europe. The programme will  contribute in the medium and longer terms to enhancing Europe's competitiveness in the economic activities which will be based on these developments and to strengthening economic and social cohesion in the Community.\nThe programme is targeted at complementing existing initiatives in Member States through the development of further collaborative linkages between different research groups and industries, and shall concentrate on the interface between food processing,  food distribution and the consumer. Consumer demands for more natural and healthy foods, with greater diversity, shall be met by the combined efforts of researchers and the food industry.\nThis should contribute also to a better control of processes (including chemical treatment and additives) and a reduction of harmful residues while safeguarding food safety and quality.\nThe programme shall avoid adverse effects on public health and the environment, and the creation of problems with respect to the protection and enhancement of nature.\nCONTENT\nThe research activities in this programme have been divided into three sectors. New or improved technologies and processing innovations, which enhance food quality, safety and nutritive values, shall also be supported in each sector.\n1.  Assessment and enhancement of food quality and diversity\nshall consist of research and development on:\n- quantitative measures of \u00c2\u00b4quality';\n- objective organoleptic and sensory criteria and their relationship to quality;\n- quantitative measurement of \u00c2\u00b4freshness' of processed foods;\n- the quality aspects of raw materials as they affect processing and end-products;\n- new or improved technologies and processing innovations, including those of a biotechnological nature which enhance food quality while also facilitating processing and building consumer confidence, or which make possible greater diversity in the  supply of foodstuffs.\n2.  Food hygiene, safety and toxicological aspects\nshall concern research and development on:\n- improved rapid screening tests to predict potential toxicity factors, for example residues from agricultural production, processing and environmental pollution;\n- the occurrence of natural plant toxins and their effects on food;\n- predicting micro-organism growth rates, accelerated methods for specific organisms and total counts;\n- improved understanding of the relationship between food constituents and food intolerances;\n- the application of these tests in food processing and new food-product development to ensure the safety of both processes and products.\n3.  Nutrition and wholesomeness aspects\nshall consist of research and development on:\n- the evaluation of the effects of new or improved processing technologies and/or ingredient substitution on dietary, nutritional values and wholesomeness aspects of food;\n- methodologies for the nutritional evaluation of foods;\n- the bioavailability of the nutritional constituents (e.g. vitamins and minerals) and the effects of processing, distribution, catering, storage and domestic use;\n- the nutritional and wholesomeness value of foods designed for particular uses (e.g. slimming or athletics) or important to sub-groups in the population (e.g. infants and the elderly);\n- those new or improved processes and technologies which enhance the nutritional value and wholesomeness of foods.\nIMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES\nThe programme shall consist of work carried out as concerted and shared-cost actions, and by training/mobility grants. All projects shall be carried out by participants from more than one Member State (irrespective of participants from third countries)  and shall contribute to the development of European networks of centres investigating the properties of foodstuffs.\nParticipation in concerted actions is open to all Member States, to European third countries which have concluded framework agreements in scientific and technical cooperation with the Community and COST participating States.\nParticipants in a project conducted as a shared-cost action may be industrial enterprises, including SMEs, research institutions, universities or combinations of them, established in the Community or in those European third countries which have  concluded framework agreements in scientific and technical cooperation with the Community.\nAs a general rule, research institutes and universities shall participate in a group together with one or more industrial organizations. Research institutes which are funded principally or exclusively by industrial organizations shall be considered as  industrial participants.\nFor those actions which are conducted on a shared-cost basis, the Community contribution shall not normally exceed 50 % of the total expenditure, the remainder to be provided mainly from industrial sources. Alternatively, in respect of universities and  research institutes carrying out projects, the Community may bear up to 100 % of the additional expenditure involved.\nShared-cost research contracts shall be awarded following a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nTraining/mobility grants shall be included to facilitate the assembly of relevant skills at appropriate locations for the work of the projects, and to promote effective diffusion of the knowledge resulting from them. The programme shall also include  coordination activities such as the organization of meetings, consultation with national experts and studies on related topics, such as structural and social effects of applications of the programme results.\nSpecial attention will be paid to the dissemination of the programme results, in order to maximize the effects of this work and to allow all enterprises, particularly SMEs, in all regions of the Community, including the less-favoured ones to benefit  directly.\nThe contracts entered into by the Commission shall regulate the rights and obligations of each party, in particular the methods of disseminating, protecting and exploiting the research results.\nCooperation between the participants in the programme and consumer protection groups shall be encouraged, in particular through appropriate workshops and seminars.\nIn view of the close relationship between this programme and the Eclair programme, the Committee called upon to assist the Commission in the implementation of the programme shall be the same as that set up by Decision\n89/160/EEC (;) for the Eclair programme.\nEVALUATION OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA\nThe Commission's communication to the Council concerning a Community Plan of Action relating to the evaluation of Community research and development activities for the years 1987 to 1991 states that the objectives and milestones of each research  programme have to be set out in a testable form. These which are set out overleaf.\n(;) OJ No L 60, 3. 3. 1989, p. 48.\n1.\nThe long-term objective of this programme is to contribute to the competitiveness of Europe's food industries, and to improveed consumer protection and confidence, by strengthening the links between them through research and development. The Commission  proposes to achieve this objective by launching a programme of concerted actions and cost-shared actions. The projects seek to promote the close collaboration between research and technological development on food quality, hygiene, safety, toxicology,  nutritional and wholesomeness values.\n2.\nThe primary short-term objective is that the programme should succeed in eliciting proposals, for concerted actions (with national agreement) and for RTD cost-shared projects (with commitments to cofinance from industry), on a scale commensurate with  the Community resources proposed. This objective shall be testable from 1991 to 1992.\nAt this time, the programme should also demonstrate its promotion and encouragement of inter-sectoral collaboration across the Member States and in Europe, in particular between enterprises including SMEs.\n3.\nParticular objectives to be attained within three years of the programme implementation are as follows:\n3.1.\nthat improved food evaluation and assessment techniques have been developed, in particular sensory analysis, and that the results have given grounds to expect that they will find applications which will benefit industry, including SMEs, and/or the  consumer;\n3.2.\nthat new or improved, rapid tests for food hygiene, safety and toxicological aspects have been developed; that advantages in terms of precision, effectiveness or the avoidance of possible adverse side-effects have been indicated; and that, as a result  of the tests, the products, techniques or services have practical applications for industry and/or the consumer;\n3.3.\nthat research and development has been conducted on the nutritional value of foods; that useful tests have been developed to measure the nutritional value of food constituents, including the effects of processing; and that as a result the nutritional  and wholesomeness values of those foods are enhanced;\n3.4.\nthat studies and tests have been conducted for the development of new or improved, novel processing technologies or innovations which enhance food quality, safety, and nutritional value and that, as a result of such studies and projects, new  applications have been found.\n4.\nIn addition, the programme should ensure that the following general criteria are met:\n4.1.\nthat the potential increase in market opportunities, in the medium or longterm, as a result of the improvements or benefits demonstrated, is of a size to justify the Community expenditures committed;\n4.2.\nthat the consumer confidence in food research and industry is encouraged and high standards for consumer protection are maintained;\n4.3.\nthat studies have been carried out on the potential structural and social effects of the application of the results;\n4.4.\nthat the execution of the programme has avoided harmful effects on public health and the environment, and has not created problems with respect to the protection and enhancement of nature;\n4.5.\ntaking account of the results of Community, national or private sector research activities in food science and technology, the Evaluation Panel shall consider whether the Flair programme has:\n- contributed to the application of the results of the said research activities in the regions of the Community other than those in which the research was conducted;\n- given adequate consideration to all the selection criteria set out in Annex III to Decision 87/516/Euratom, EEC which includes that of contributing to the strengthening of the economic and social cohesion of the Community, while being consistent with  the pursuit of scientific and technical excellence.\nThe Panel will also consider whether the programme has produced added value attributable to the Community character of the programme (i.e. not readily obtainable via Member State actions alone)."}
