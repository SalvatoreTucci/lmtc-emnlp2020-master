All other supplier countries fall into the category of \u2018Other third countries\u2019. The utilisation rate of the quota allocated to \u2018Other third countries\u2019 is very low.\n(4) The certificates of origin are therefore superfluous and should be abolished for simplification purposes.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1979/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Article 11 and Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1979/2006 are hereby deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nFranco FRATTINI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 273, 17.10.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 368, 23.12.2006, p. 91."}
