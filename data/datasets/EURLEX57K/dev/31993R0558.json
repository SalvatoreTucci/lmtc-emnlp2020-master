Field of application\nApplication of this method is related to the quantity of sugar present in the product analised. The presence of amino acids, salts of organic acids, inorganic salts, fat, flavonoids and alcohol alters the refractive index.\nII. Definition\nDry soluble residue content (determined by refractometry) means the percentage weight of sucrose in an aqueous solution of sucrose which, under given conditions, has the same refractive index as the product analysed. The product's dry soluble residue  content is expressed in grams per 100 grams (g/100 g).\nIII. Principle\nDeduction of the dry soluble residue content of a product from its refractive index.\nIV. Apparatus\nAbbe-type refractometer\nThis apparatus must enable the percentage weight of sucrose to be determined to the nearest \u00b1 0,1 %.\nThe refractometer must have a thermometer with a scale extending at least from + 15 \u00b0C to + 25 \u00b0C. It must also have a water circulator enabling the temperature to be adjusted with an accuracy of \u00b1 0,5 \u00b0C.\nOperating instructions for this apparatus, and in particular those dealing with calibration and light source, must be strictly followed.\nV. Method\n1. Preparation of sample\n1.1. Liquid products\nMix carefully and proceed to determination.\n1.2. Semi-dense products, pur\u00e9es, fruit juices with matter in suspension\nCarefully mix an average laboratory sample and then homogenize. Strain part of the sample through dry gauze folded in four, remove the first drops and proceed to determination on the filtrate.\n1.3. Dense products (jams and jellies)\nIf the previously homogenized product cannot be used directly, weigh 40 g of the product to the nearest 0,01 g in a 250 ml beaker and add 100 ml of distilled water.\nBoil gently for two or three minutes, stirring with a glass rod.\nCool, pour the contents of the beaker into an appropriate tared vessel using distilled water as a flushing liquid, add distilled water so as to obtain about 200 g of product, weigh it to the nearest 0,01 g, and mix the solution throuroughly.\nAllow to stand for 20 minutes, then strain through a folded filter or a Buechner funnel.\nMake determination on the filtrate.\n1.4. Frozen products\nDefrost and remove stones or pips and cores. Mix the product with the liquid formed during defrosting and proceed as in 1.2 or 1.3.\n1.5. Dry products or products containing whole fruit or pieces of fruit\nCut the laboratory sample - or part of it - into small pieces, remove stones or pips and cores and mix carefully.\nWeigh 10 to 20 g of the product to the nearest 0,01 g in a beaker.\nAdd distilled water corresponding to five times the weight of the product. Heat in a water bath for 30 minutes stirring occasionally with a glass rod. When cool, continue as described in 1.3.\n1.6. Products containing alcohol\nWeigh about 100 g of sample to the nearest 0,01 g into a tared beaker. Place the beaker in a bath of boiled water for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally with a glass rod, and add distilled water if necessary.\nWhere the alcohol content exceeds about 5 % mass add more distilled water and heat again in the water bath for 45 minutes.\nAfter cooling weigh the final contents of the vessel, filer if necessary, and continue with the determination.\n2. Determination\nBring the sample to the measurement temperature by immersing the container in a water bath at the required temperature.\nPlace a small sample on the lower prism of the refractometer, taking care to ensure that the sample covers the glass surface uniformly when the prisms are pressed against each other. Measure in accordance with the operating instructions for the  apparatur used.\nRead the percentage weight of sucrose to the nearest 0,1 %.\nMake at least two determinations on the same prepared sample.\nVI. Expression of results\nCalculation and formulation\nThe dry soluble residue content, conventionally expressed in grams of sucrose per 100 grams of product, is calculated as follows. The percentage sucrose content indicated by refractometry is used directly. If the reading is made at a temperature other  than + 20 \u00b0C, correct as indicated in the attached table.\nIf measurement has been made on a dilute solution, the dry soluble residue content (M) is calculated using the following formula:\nM = M \u00d7 100 E M being the weight (in grams) of dry soluble residue per 100 g of product indicated by the refractometer and E the weight (in grams) of product per 100 g of solution.\nCorrections when determination is made at a temperature other than 20 \u00b0C\n\"\"Subtract\" ID=\"01\">15> ID=\"02\">0,25> ID=\"03\">0,27> ID=\"04\">0,31> ID=\"05\">0,31> ID=\"06\">0,34> ID=\"07\">0,35> ID=\"08\">0,36> ID=\"09\">0,37> ID=\"10\">0,36> ID=\"11\">0,36\"> ID=\"01\">16> ID=\"02\">0,21> ID=\"03\">0,23> ID=\"04\">0,27> ID=\"05\">0,27>  ID=\"06\">0,29> ID=\"07\">0,31> ID=\"08\">0,31> ID=\"09\">0,32> ID=\"10\">0,31> ID=\"11\">0,23\"> ID=\"01\">17> ID=\"02\">0,16> ID=\"03\">0,18> ID=\"04\">0,20> ID=\"05\">0,20> ID=\"06\">0,22> ID=\"07\">0,23> ID=\"08\">0,23> ID=\"09\">0,23> ID=\"10\">0,20> ID=\"11\">0,17\"> ID=\"01\">18>  ID=\"02\">0,11> ID=\"03\">0,12> ID=\"04\">0,14> ID=\"05\">0,15> ID=\"06\">0,16> ID=\"07\">0,16> ID=\"08\">0,15> ID=\"09\">0,12> ID=\"10\">0,12> ID=\"11\">0,09\"> ID=\"01\">19> ID=\"02\">0,06> ID=\"03\">0,07> ID=\"04\">0,08> ID=\"05\">0,08> ID=\"06\">0,08> ID=\"07\">0,09> ID=\"08\">0,09>  ID=\"09\">0,08> ID=\"10\">0,07> ID=\"11\">0,05\">Add\" ID=\"01\">21> ID=\"02\">0,06> ID=\"03\">0,07> ID=\"04\">0,07> ID=\"05\">0,07> ID=\"06\">0,07> ID=\"07\">0,07> ID=\"08\">0,07> ID=\"09\">0,07> ID=\"10\">0,07> ID=\"11\">0,07\"> ID=\"01\">22> ID=\"02\">0,12> ID=\"03\">0,14>  ID=\"04\">0,14> ID=\"05\">0,14> ID=\"06\">0,14> ID=\"07\">0,14> ID=\"08\">0,14> ID=\"09\">0,14> ID=\"10\">0,14> ID=\"11\">0,14\"> ID=\"01\">23> ID=\"02\">0,18> ID=\"03\">0,20> ID=\"04\">0,20> ID=\"05\">0,21> ID=\"06\">0,21> ID=\"07\">0,21> ID=\"08\">0,21> ID=\"09\">0,22> ID=\"10\">0,22>  ID=\"11\">0,22\"> ID=\"01\">24> ID=\"02\">0,24> ID=\"03\">0,26> ID=\"04\">0,26> ID=\"05\">0,27> ID=\"06\">0,28> ID=\"07\">0,28> ID=\"08\">0,28> ID=\"09\">0,28> ID=\"10\">0,29> ID=\"11\">0,29\"> ID=\"01\">25> ID=\"02\">0,30> ID=\"03\">0,32> ID=\"04\">0,32> ID=\"05\">0,34> ID=\"06\">0,36>  ID=\"07\">0,36> ID=\"08\">0,36> ID=\"09\">0,36> ID=\"10\">0,36> ID=\"11\">0,37 \">\nThe temperature may not vary by more than \u00b1 5 \u00b0C from 20 \u00b0C."}
