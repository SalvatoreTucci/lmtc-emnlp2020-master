Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(2) In Directive 98/69/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 13 October 1998 relating to measures to be taken against air pollution from motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/220/EEC(5), the type I test cycle for emission measurement was amended by abolishing the initial 40 seconds of engine idle time. It is necessary to align the test cycle for the measurement of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in Directive 80/1268/EEC accordingly.\n(3) With a view to the monitoring of CO2 emissions in the framework of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions of passenger cars, it is appropriate to introduce into Directive 80/1268/EEC new technical requirements regarding the measurement of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for the EC type-approval of gas-fuelled vehicles (LPG and NG). In this respect, it is appropriate to follow the technical requirements adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in its Regulation No 101(6).\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Directive 80/1268/EEC are hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
