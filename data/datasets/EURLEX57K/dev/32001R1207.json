It is desirable to simplify this situation, while ensuring that the machinery of the preferential arrangements can continue to operate properly.\n(4) The authorities responsible for issuing or verifying proofs of origin should be in a position to fulfil the Community's commitments under the preferential agreements within the requisite deadlines.\n(5) In the interests of clarity, Regulation (EEC) No 3351/83 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation lays down rules intended to facilitate:\n(a) the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 by Member States authorities, the making-out of invoice declarations or forms EUR.2 by Community exporters;\n(b) the issue of approved-exporter authorisations valid in several Member States;\n(c) the functioning of the methods of administrative cooperation between the Member States.", "Supplier's declarations and their use\n1.
