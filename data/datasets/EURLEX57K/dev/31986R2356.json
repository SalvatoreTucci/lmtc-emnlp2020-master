whereas following the accession to the Community of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, a supplementary Protocol is to be signed in the near future; whereas until the entry into force of that Protocol, Council Regulation (EEC) No 744/86 of 1986 (1) laid down arrangements applicable to trade in certain agricultural products with Sweden in particular;\nWhereas the said Regulation (EEC) No 744/86 provides for the opening, to run from 1 March 1986, of a 6 000 tonnes Community tariff quota at a reduced rate of duty for frozen peas, originating in Sweden, 4 500 tonnes of which are reserved for Spain; whereas therefore the tariff quota in question should be opened for the period from 1 March to 31 December 1986; whereas in the absence of a 'prorata temporis' clause, the proposed annual quota volume should be opened for the period under consideration;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of levy for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is used up; whereas, in the light of the principles outlined above, a Community tariff arrangement based on an allocation between the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to represent as closely as possible the real market trend of the product in question, the allocation should follow proportionately the requirements of the Member States calculated both from statistics of imports from Sweden during a representative reference period and according to the economic outlook for the tariff year in question;\nWhereas during the last two years for which statistics are available, imports of frozen peas, including chick peas, originating in Sweden, into each of the Member States were as follows:\n(tonnes)\n1.2.3 //  //  //  // Member State  // 1983   // 1984   //  //   //   // Benelux   // 0   // 138   // Denmark   // 121  // 254   // Germany   // 1 365   // 1 432   // Greece   // 231   // 0   // France   // 0   // 0   // Ireland   // 0   // 0  // Italy   // 2 764   // 7 568   // Portugal   // 223   // 0  // United Kingdom   // 0   // 647   //    //   //   //   // 4 704   // 10 039   //    //   //\nWhereas, during the last two years under consideration, the products in question were imported only by certain Member States and not at all by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, initial shares should be allocated to the importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quota upon imports into those States of the products concerned being notified; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;\nWhereas in taking into account these factors, the Member States' initial percentage shares in the quota volume can be set as follows:\nBenelux 0,94\nDenmark 2,54\nGermany 18,97\nGreece 1,57\nItaly 70,08\nPortugal 1,51\nUnited Kingdom 4,39\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover the subsequent requirements of these Member States where they have used up their initial share and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, it is appropriate to fix the first instalment of the Community quota at a level which, in the circumstances, could be 98 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional\nshare from the reserve; whereas each time its additional share is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission and the Commission must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas, if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused it is essential that such State should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.

If an importer notifies the imminent import of the products in question into a Member State that does not participate in the initial allocation and requests the benefit of the quota, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to these requirements to the extent that the available balance of the reserve so permits.", "1. If a Member State has used 90 % or more of its initial share as fixed in Article 2 (2), or of that share minus any portion returned to the reserve pursuant to Article 5, it shall forthwith, by notifying the Commission, draw a second share, to the extent that the reserve so permits, equal to 10 % of its initial share, rounded up as necessary to the next whole number.\n2. If a Member State, after exhausting its initial share, has used 90 % or more of the second share drawn by it, that Member State shall forthwith, in the manner and to the extent provided in paragraph 1, draw a third share equal to 5 % of its initial share, rounded up as necessary to the whole number.\n3. If a Member State, after exhausting its second share, has used 90 % or more of the third share drawn by it, that Member State shall, in the manner and to the extent provided in paragraph 1, draw a fourth share equal to the third.\nThis process shall apply until the reserve is used up.\n4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, 2 and 3, a Member State may draw shares lower than those specified in those paragraphs if there are grounds for believing that those specified may not be used in full.

Article 5\nMember States shall, not later than 15 November 1986, return to the reserve the unused portion of their initial share which, on 1 November 1986, is in excess of 20 % of the initial volume. They may return a greater portion if there are grounds for believing that it may be used in full.\nMember States shall, not later than 15 November 1986, notify the Commission of the total quantities of the product in question imported up to and including 1 November 1986 and charged against the Community quota and of any portion of their initial shares returned to the reserve.", "The Commission shall keep an account of the shares opened by the Member States pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 and shall, as soon as the information reaches it, inform each State of the extent to which the reserve has been used up.\nIt shall, not later than 20 November 1986, inform the Member States of the amount still in reserve, following any return of shares pursuant to Article 5.\nIt shall ensure that the drawing which exhausts the reserve does not exceed the balance available, and to this end shall notify the amount of that balance to the Member State making the last drawing.", "1. The Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that additional shares drawn pursuant to Article 3 are opened in such a way that importations may be charged without interruption against their accumulated shares of the Community quota.\n2. The Member States shall ensure that importers of the product in question have free access to the shares allocated to them.\n3.
