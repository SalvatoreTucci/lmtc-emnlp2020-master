Modifications to these lists are to be adopted in compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 3 of that Regulation and in accordance with the procedure referred to in its Article 14(3).\n(3) New vitamin and mineral forms have been evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority. The substances which have received a favourable scientific opinion and for which the requirements laid down in Directive 2002/46/EC and in Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 are complied with should be added to the respective lists in those acts.\n(4) Interested parties were consulted and the provided comments were taken into consideration.\n(5) Following the scientific evaluation by the European
