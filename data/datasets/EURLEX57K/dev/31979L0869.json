If there is no pollution in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 and if there is no risk of the quality of water deteriorating and if the water in question is superior in quality to the indications given in column  A1 of Annex II to Directive 75/440/EEC, the authorities concerned may decide that no regular analysis is necessary.", "1.
