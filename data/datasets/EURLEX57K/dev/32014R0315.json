Pending the conclusion of those consultations on the arrangements for 2014, Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 fixed provisional fishing opportunities for certain stocks of blue whiting. On 12 March 2014, the consultations with Norway and the Faroe Islands were concluded, including those related to blue whiting.\n(4) Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The catch limits provided for in Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 apply from 1 January 2014. The provisions of this Regulation concerning catch limits should therefore also apply from that date. Such retroactive application is without prejudice to the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations as the fishing opportunities concerned were set to zero in the Regulation (EU) No 43/2014. Since the modification of this catch limit has an influence on the economic activities and the planning of the fishing season of Union vessels, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\nAnnex IA to Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 is amended in accordance with the text set out in Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 March 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA..
