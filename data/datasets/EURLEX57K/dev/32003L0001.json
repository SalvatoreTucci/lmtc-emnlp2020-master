That Decision has been repealed by Commission Decision 2000/418/EC of 29 June 2000 regulating the use of material presenting risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Decision 94/474/EC(4). With regard to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for consumers (SCCNFP) it is appropriate to align Reference number 419 of Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 270/2002(6).\n(2) A reference to specified risk materials as designated in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, should be inserted into Reference number 419 of Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(3) It follows from Article 22(1) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, however, that the provisions of Annex XI Part A of that Regulation apply until the date of the adoption of a decision after which Article 8 of that Regulation and Annex V to it become applicable. Therefore, Reference number 419 of Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC should also refer to Annex XI Part A of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.\n(4) Directive 76/768/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) Given the specific nature of the risk materials, the Member States must be able to take the measures provided for in this Directive without having to wait for the final date specified.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Cosmetic Products Sector,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
