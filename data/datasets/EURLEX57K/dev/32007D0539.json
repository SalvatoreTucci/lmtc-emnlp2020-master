This may or may not be integrated in the camera head;\n(c) an optical block, front module or similar device with one or more image sensors where the effective diagonal size of the light sensitive scanning area is equal to or larger than 6 mm. This may or may not be integrated in the camera head;\n(d) a camera viewfinder. This may or may not be integrated in the camera head;\n(e) a Base station or Camera Control Unit (CCU) connected to the camera by a cable or other means such as a wireless connection;\n(f) an Operational Control Panel (OCP) or equivalent device for camera control (i.e. for colour adjustment lens opening or iris) of single cameras;\n(g) a Master Control Panel (MCP) or Master set-up unit (MSU) for the overview and for adjustment of several remote cameras;\n(h) a box lens adaptation unit such as a Large Lens Adapter or SuperXpander that enables portable camera systems to be used with box-type lenses.\n(6) The product covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000\u00a0(3), i.e. television camera systems originating in Japan, currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a08525\u00a080\u00a019, ex\u00a08528\u00a049\u00a035, ex\u00a08528\u00a049\u00a091, ex\u00a08528\u00a059\u00a090, ex\u00a08529\u00a090\u00a092, ex\u00a08529\u00a090\u00a097, ex\u00a08537\u00a010\u00a091, ex\u00a08537\u00a010\u00a099 and 8543\u00a070\u00a090 (CN codes since 1 January 2007) falls entirely within the above product definition. In December 2006, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1910/2006\u00a0(4) confirmed these measures further to an expiry review in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation (the original measures). The original measures are dealt with in a parallel Council Regulation (EC) No 906/2007\u00a0(5).\n(7) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers and associations of importers or exporters known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, users, consumer organisations and the complainant Community producers of the initiation of the investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation and questionnaires were sent to all parties concerned.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(8) By a letter of 12 April 2007 addressed to the Commission, Grass Valley Nederland B.V. formally withdrew its complaint.\n(9) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(10) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain camera systems originating in Japan should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain camera systems originating in Japan is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 July 2007.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
