ANNEX   PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES, CONTENTS, IMPLEMENTATION, INDICATIVE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA  1.  OBJECTIVES\nTELEMAN's objective is to realize advanced tele-operators that respond to the ultimate needs of the nuclear industry in order to reinforce the scientific and technological base used for the design of nuclear remote handling equipment. Tele-operators  contribute to the safety and profitability of man and plant employed in all parts of the nuclear industry, from mining through reactor operation to reprocessing and decommissioning. This programme concerns the contribution that tele-operators can make  to nuclear safety in the areas of accident management where the environment may have changed unpredictably and decommissioning, including prevention, inspection and maintenance.\nThe tele-operators of interest are mechanical arms to which a variety of tools and sensors can be attached, manipulators attached to movable gantrys and partially autonomous vehicles equipped for specialized jobs.\nIn particular, TELEMAN will help the nuclear industry to comply with the requirements that workers be exposed to the minimum practicable amount of radiation, always remaining within relevant limits, without compromising inspection, maintenance and  repair operations.\n2.  PROGRAMME TECHNICAL CONTENT\nIndicative\nallocation\nof funds\n(millions of ecus)\nArea 1: Tele-operator component and sub-system development\n8,8\nIn the framework of the abovementioned nuclear safety objectives, research and development will be carried out on the utilization, modification and, where necessary, the development of sensors, perception and decision-making systems, information  transmission and engineering for tele-operator mobility and dexterity in nuclear environments.\nArea 2: Environmental tolerance\n2,5\nResearch will be carried out throughout the life of the programme on the adaptation of sensors and electronic hardware to nuclear environments, the development of machine monitoring systems and design strategies that permit easy repair or recovery of  stranded machines.\nArea 3: Research machine projects\n6,4\nDevelopment will be focussed on tele-operators that respond to the demands of the nuclear industry for enhanced safety. These will be defined in consultation with end-users who in turn will be expected to test new tele-operators in their installations  (cf. Area 4). Definition of industry's needs will precede the launching of research in Areas 1 and 2.\nProducts of research on components and sub-systems will be demonstrated by incorporating them into research machines that already exist or into new machines that typify nuclear industry requirements, such as intelligent manipulators and cranes equipped  with control systems suitable for use in high radiation fields, and a mobile platform for information gathering under normal and abnormal conditions.\nArea 4: Product evaluation and studies\n1,3\nEnd-users of TELEMAN technology will be encouraged to test and evaluate the practicality and reliability of the products of the programme in realistic environments to guide the subsequent commercialization of successful ones by industry. Studies will be  made of topics relating to the application of new technologies, new uses for computer assisted tele-operators, the evolution of guidelines and standards and programme development.\nTOTAL\n19,0\n3.  IMPLEMENTATION\nThe programme consists of activities carried out by means of shared-cost research contracts with competent public organizations or private firms established in the Member States. The participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the programme  will be encouraged.\nThe Commission shall distribute, in all Community languages, information packs to accompany the invitation to participate in order to guarantee equal opportunities for the undertakings, universities and research centres in the Member States.\nIn addition to shared-cost research contracts, the programme may also be carried out by means of study contracts, coordination projects and awards of training and mobility grants. Such contracts and grants shall, where appropriate, be awarded following  a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nParticipants in shared-cost contracts may be industrial organizations, research institutes and universities, established in the Community. Each contracting party will be expected to make a significant contribution to projects. The contracting party  shall be expected to bear a substantial proportion of the costs, 50 % of which shall normally be borne by the Community. Alternatively, in respect of universities and similar organizations carrying out projects, the Community may bear up to 100 % of the  additional expenditure involved.\nShared-cost research projects should, where appropriate, be carried out by participants from more than one Member State.\nThe information resulting from the implementation of the shared-cost activities shall be made accessible on an equal basis to all Member States. Licences and/or other rights developed in the framework of the programme will be subject to the normal  contractual conditions of the Community.\n4.  EVALUATION CRITERIA\nThe Commission requires that, where possible, the objectives and milestones of each research programme be set out in a quantitative form to facilitate evaluation.\nThe long term objectives (2 000) are that operators of nuclear installations should be able to buy world-class computer assisted tele-operators from Community-based manufacturers and that the radiation exposure of workers should be appreciably reduced.\nTELEMAN's principal technical objectives relate to reinforcing the scientific and engineering base upon which the design of nuclear remote handling is based, to solving problems of manipulation, material transport and mobile surveillance within the  nuclear environment and to demonstrating the feasibility of the solutions offered.\nThe technical criteria in terms of which the different aspects of the programme are to be evaluated, initially in 1992 to 1993 and more thoroughly in about 1996, are:\n- the extent to which projects were selected against credible technical criteria,\n- the development achieved within TELEMAN projects, e.g. whether TELEMAN projects achieved a significant (100 %) improvement in performance and performance/price ratios. Typical performance parameters might be sensor resolution, power/weight ratio,  system response time, etc.,\n- the extent to which different technologies have been integrated,\n- the performance and acceptance of research machines in tests conducted with the participation of potential end-users,\n- whether the projects were of high scientific value as judged by the number and impact of patents, publications in referred journals and invited contributions to conferences. Output should be compared with that from other similar programmes being  executed elsewhere.\nTELEMAN's industrial objectives relate to more effective application of investment in research, generation of awareness of the potential of computer assisted tele-operators, and creation of a pool of experienced firms and engineers able to exploit  research machines and manage the application of the new technology.\nThe industrial criteria in terms of which the different aspects of the programme are to be evaluated are:\n- whether the calls for proposals attracted sufficient industrial interest to permit formulation of a coherent programme. The criterion of sufficiency would be that the ratio resources proferred by industrial contractors to Community funding is to be  greater than 1,5,\n- the extent to which projects were selected against credible industrial criteria,\n- that at least half the proposals received envisage a major role for a university or research laboratory in a Member State other than that of an industrial partner,\n- the extent to which links formed to execute TELEMAN projects have continued and led to joint development of industrial products, new multinational firms or new research projects,\n- application of technology and patents arising from TELEMAN are applied by other firms and in other industries."}
