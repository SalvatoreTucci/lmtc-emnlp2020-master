In addition, that Decision approved the eradication programmes adopted by certain Member States in respect of the areas and the diseases listed in Annex II thereto. That Decision also approved the surveillance programmes regarding ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar) adopted by certain Member States in respect of the areas set out in Annex III thereto.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2010/221/EU currently lists the following parts of the United Kingdom as being free of ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar): the territory of Great Britain, except Whitstable Bay in Kent, Blackwater Estuary in Essex and Poole Harbour in Dorset, the area of Larne Lough in the territory of Northern Ireland and the territory of Guernsey.\n(4) The United Kingdom notified the Commission that OsHV-1 \u03bcVar was also detected in Crassostrea gigas from the River Crouch in Essex. This incident is a new outbreak of OsHV-1 \u03bcVar in an area included in the territory of Great Britain currently being declared free of the disease. The geographical demarcation of the areas of the United Kingdom with approved national measures listed in Annex I to Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended.\n(5) The United Kingdom also informed the Commission that the entry of the geographical demarcation for the parts of Northern Ireland which are declared free of OsHV-1 \u03bcVar in Annex I to Decision 2010/221/EU is not in accordance with its declaration. The correct demarcation should be \u2018The territory of Northern Ireland except Dundrum Bay, Killough Bay, Lough Foyle, Carlingford Lough and Strangford Lough\u2019. Annex I should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The continental parts of the territory of Finland are listed in Annex II to Decision 2010/221/EU as a territory with an approved eradication programme as regards bacterial kidney disease (BKD).\n(7) Accordingly, Decision 2010/221/EU approves certain national measures taken by Finland in relation to the movement of consignments of aquaculture animals of susceptible species into those areas. However, to allow for a re-evaluation of the appropriateness of those national measures, Article 3(2) of that Decision limits the authorisation to apply those measures in time until 31 December 2015.\n(8) Finland informed the Commission that it decided to withdraw BKD from the list of aquatic animal diseases to be controlled and eradicated on a mandatory basis in Finland. That decision entered into force on 1 December 2014. As a result, from that date on Finland no longer has an eradication programme for BKD in place as approved in accordance with Article 43 of Directive 2006/88/EC for the whole or parts of its territory. Consequently, the entry for Finland in Annex II to Decision 2010/221/EU should be deleted, and this amendment should apply from 1 December 2014.\n(9) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU currently lists seven compartments within the territory of Ireland with an approved surveillance programme as regards ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bcvar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar).\n(10) Ireland has notified the Commission of the detection of OsHV-1 \u03bcVar in one of those compartments, namely Askeaton Bay in compartment 6. Consequently, the geographical demarcation of compartment 6 in the entry for Ireland in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU should be amended.\n(11) Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Decision 2010/221/EU are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 December 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0328, 24.11.2006, p.\u00a014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a098, 20.4.2010, p.\u00a07.\nANNEX\nANNEX I\nMember States and areas regarded as being free of diseases listed in the table and approved to take national measures to prevent the introduction of those diseases in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the area with approved national measures\nSpring viraemia of carp (SVC) Denmark DK Whole territory\nIreland IE Whole territory\nHungary HU Whole territory\nFinland FI Whole territory\nSweden SE Whole territory\nUnited Kingdom UK The whole territory of the United Kingdom\nBacterial kidney disease (BKD) Ireland IE Whole territory\nUnited Kingdom UK The territory of Northern Ireland\nInfectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) Finland FI The continental parts of the territory\nSweden SE The continental parts of the territory\nUnited Kingdom UK The territory of the Isle of Man\nInfections with Gyrodactylus salaris (GS) Ireland IE Whole territory\nFinland FI The water catchment areas of the Tenjoki and N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4m\u00f6njoki; the water catchment areas of the Paatsjoki, Tuulomajoki, and Uutuanjoki are considered as buffer zones\nUnited Kingdom UK The whole territory of the United Kingdom\nOstreid herpesvirus 1\u00a0\u03bcvar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar) United Kingdom UK The territory of Great Britain, except Whitstable Bay in Kent, Blackwater Estuary and River Crouch in Essex and Poole Harbour in Dorset\nANNEX II\nMember States and parts thereof with eradication programmes as regards certain diseases in aquaculture animals and approved to take national measures to control those diseases in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the area with approved national measures\nBacterial kidney disease (BKD) Sweden SE The continental parts of the territory\nInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPN) Sweden SE The coastal parts of the territory\nANNEX III\nMember States and areas with surveillance programmes regarding ostreid herpes virus 1 \u03bcvar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar) and approved to take national measures to control that disease in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the area with approved national measures (Member States, zones and compartments)\nOstreid herpesvirus 1\u00a0\u03bcvar (OsHV-1 \u03bcVar) Ireland IE Compartment 1: Sheephaven Bay"}
