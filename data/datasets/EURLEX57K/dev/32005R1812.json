Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the micro-organism preparation No 5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 493.94) has been authorised for horses provisionally for four years by Commission Regulation (EC) No 490/2004\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an increase of the Colony Forming Units minimum content of this preparation in the column \u2018chemical formula, description\u2019 without changing the maximum, minimum or recommended contents in complete feedingstuffs in the conditions of authorisation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised until 20 March 2008.\n(6) The use of the micro-organism preparation No E 1704 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 493.94) has been authorised for calves and cattle for fattening without a time-limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an increase of the Colony Forming Units minimum content of this preparation in the column \u2018chemical formula, description\u2019 without changing the maximum, minimum or recommended contents in complete feedingstuffs in the conditions of authorisation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation No E 1623 of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106), endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC\u00a02105) and subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 2107) has been authorised for chickens for fattening without a time-limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of a change of the minimum enzyme activity in this preparation as described in the column \u2018chemical formula, description\u2019 without changing the maximum, minimum or recommended contents in complete feedingstuffs in the conditions of authorisation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(8) The use of the enzyme preparation No E 1627 of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC\u00a02106) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) has been authorised for pigs for fattening without a time-limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 833/2005\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of a change in the formulation of this preparation as described in the column \u2018chemical formula, description\u2019 without changing the maximum, minimum or recommended contents in complete feedingstuffs in the conditions of authorisation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex IV, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(9) Regulations (EC) Nos 490/2004, 1288/2004, 521/2005 and 833/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 490/2004 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 is replaced by Annex III to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 833/2005 is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
