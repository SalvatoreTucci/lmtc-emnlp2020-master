This requires the definition of the agricultural holdings covered by the survey. The different categories for the breakdown of the survey results, and the herd size classes and the territorial subdivisions according to which the Member States draw up the survey results at regular intervals must also be precisely defined. A standard definition of carcass weight is necessary for drawing up slaughtering statistics.\n(3) Under Directive 93/24/EEC, the Member States may, at their request, be authorised to carry out the May/June or November/December surveys in selected regions, provided that these surveys cover at least 70\u00a0% of the bovine population. Member States whose bovine population makes up only a small percentage of the overall livestock population of the Community may also, at their request, be authorised to dispense altogether with either the May/June or the November/December survey or to use the regional breakdown for the final results of the May/June survey. Finally, the Member States may, at their request, be authorised to conduct the prescribed breakdown by herd size classes for the results of the May/June survey.\n(4) Applications have been made by the Member States for the various types of derogation.\n(5) By reason of the accession of the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, it is necessary to make certain technical adaptations and to extend certain derogations to these new Member States.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(3) establishes a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) for the Member States; the new NUTS nomenclature must therefore replace the previously defined regional levels.\n(7) Decision 94/433/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(8) This Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article 2(2) of Directive 93/24/EEC, \u2018agricultural holding\u2019 means any technical and economic unit under single management which produces agricultural products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The survey referred to in Article 1(1) of Directive 93/24/EEC shall cover:\n(a) agricultural holdings with a utilised agricultural area of 1 ha or more;\n(b) agricultural holdings with a utilised agricultural area of less than 1 ha, if their production is to a certain extent intended for sale or if their production unit exceeds certain natural thresholds.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States wishing to apply a different survey threshold shall, however, undertake to determine that threshold in such a way that only the smallest holdings are excluded, and that together the holdings excluded account for 1\u00a0% or less of the total standard gross margin, within the meaning of Commission Decision 85/377/EEC\u00a0(4), of the Member State concerned.", "The definitions of the categories of bovines referred to in Articles 3(1), 10(2) and 12(2) of Directive 93/24/EEC are set out in Annex I of this Decision.", "For the territorial subdivisions referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 93/24/EEC, the Member States shall follow the level of the common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) defined in Annex II of this Decision.
