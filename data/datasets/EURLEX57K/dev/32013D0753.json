Following the annual assessment of 2013 the Agency made its recommendation to the Commission for amending the second set of draft CSTs as set out in Commission Decision 2012/226/EU of 23 April 2012 on the second set of common safety targets as regards the rail system\u00a0(2). This Decision is based on the Agency\u2019s recommendation.\n(2) Due to the lack of consistent national data, the National Reference Values (\u2018NRVs\u2019) for Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia has been originally established for certain categories of individual risks either using not fully consistent data from 2004-2006 or on the basis of NRVs of other Member States. At present it is possible to recalculate the NRVs for these categories in a consistent way and therefore the original NRVs in the enclosed tables should be replaced.\n(3) Croatia acceded to the Union on 1 July 2013. To quantitatively identify the current safety performance of railway systems in Croatia, the NRVs have been calculated with the methodology used for other Member States. These NRVs should be included in the annex to Decision 2012/226/EU.\n(4) Decision 2012/226/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 27(1) of Directive 2004/49/EC,", "main_body": ["Section 1 \u2018National Reference Values (NRVs)\u2019 in the Annex to Decision 2012/226/EU is
