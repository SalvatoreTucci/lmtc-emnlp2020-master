Processors cannot adapt their import needs to the changing market situation if they have to apply for import rights at the beginning of the annual quota period. As a consequence some of them lose the security lodged at the moment of the application for import rights.\n(3) Giving the possibility to processors to apply for import rights on a quarterly basis instead of once a year should help them to plan their imports in shorter terms and be in a better position to respond to the rapid changes in the world beef market.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 412/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 412/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(a) from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) from 1 April to 30 June.\u2019;\n(2) Article 6 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(b) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 7 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 December 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 9.5.2008, p. 7."}
