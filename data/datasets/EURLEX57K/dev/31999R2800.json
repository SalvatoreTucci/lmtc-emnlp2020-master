The third subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 986/68 stipulates that a Member State may grant aid for skimmed-milk powder produced on its territory if it is denatured or processed into compound feedingstuffs in another Member State;\n(2) experience shows that these particular payment arrangements encumber application of the aid measure in question and make it more vulnerable to fraud. It is therefore appropriate to abolish these arrangements, the detailed rules of which are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1624/76(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3337/94(5). They should continue to apply for six months, however, so that the Member States concerned have sufficient time to introduce the normal payment arrangements. Provision should therefore be made for transitional arrangements for the period in question, which refer to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1624/76;\n(3) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["The aid payment provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 for skimmed-milk powder produced in a Member State and destined for another Member State for denaturing or processing into compound feedingstuffs there in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999(6) shall be governed by Regulation (EEC) No 1624/76 between 1 January and 30 June 2000 inclusive.", "Regulation (EEC) No 1624/76 is hereby repealed with effect from 1 July 2000.
