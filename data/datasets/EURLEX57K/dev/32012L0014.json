That list includes methyl nonyl ketone.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, methyl nonyl ketone has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 19, repellents and attractants, as defined in Annex\u00a0V to that Directive.\n(3) Spain was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 8\u00a0April\u00a02009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 9\u00a0December\u00a02011, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as repellents and containing methyl nonyl ketone may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article\u00a05 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include methyl nonyl ketone in Annex I to that Directive.\n(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(7) The provisions of this Directive should be applied at the same time in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products containing the active substance methyl nonyl ketone and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(9) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(10) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30\u00a0April\u00a02013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1\u00a0May\u00a02014.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
