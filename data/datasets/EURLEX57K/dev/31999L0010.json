whereas those particulars must accompany the name under which the product is sold;\nWhereas the indication of those particulars required by Directive 94/54/EC has the effect of making it obligatory to indicate the quantity of this ingredient or these ingredients in accordance with Article 7(2)(a) and/or (b) of Directive 79/112/EEC;\nWhereas, however, indication of the quantity of sweeteners is unlikely to govern the consumer's choice when purchasing the product;\nWhereas, on the other hand, the inclusion of particulars relating to the addition of vitamins and minerals has the effect of making nutrition labelling obligatory in accordance with Council Directive 90/496/EEC\u00a0(5); Whereas such particulars are regarded as an integral part of the name under which the product is sold or as emphasising an ingredient within the meaning of Article 7(2)(a) and/or (b) of Directive 79/112/EEC, thereby making the indication of the quantity of vitamins and minerals compulsory;\nWhereas duplicated information of this kind is not useful to consumers and could even mislead them, inasmuch as quantity is indicated as a percentage under Article 7(4) of Directive 79/112/EEC and in mg on nutrition labelling;\nWhereas under these circumstances, it is necessary to provide for further exceptions to the rule of indicating the quantities of ingredients;\nWhereas Article 7(4) of Directive 79/112/EEC states that the quantity indicated, expressed as a percentage, must correspond to the quantity of the ingredient or ingredients at the time of its/their use; whereas that paragraph nevertheless provides for derogations from that principle;\nWhereas, furthermore, the composition of certain foodstuffs is appreciably changed by cooking or other processes causing dehydration of their ingredients;\nWhereas a derogation from the method for calculating the quantity of ingredients laid down by Article 7(4) of Directive 79/112/EEC is necessary for these products in order to better reflect the true composition of the foodstuff and thereby avoid misleading the consumer,\nWhereas Article 6(5)(a) of Directive 79/112/EEC applies the same principle to the order of ingredients in the list of ingredients;\nWhereas Article 6 nevertheless provides for derogations for certain foods or ingredients; whereas, for the sake of consistency, the same derogations should be provided for the method of calculating quantity,\nWhereas, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 3b of the Treaty, the objectives of the proposed action to ensure the effective implementation of the principle of quantitative indication of ingredients cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States to the extent that the basic rules are included in Community legislation; whereas this Directive is limited to the minimum required to achieve those objectives and does not go beyond what is necessary to that end;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7(2)(a) and (b) of Directive 79/112/EEC shall not apply in cases where the wording \u2018with sweetener(s)\u2019 or \u2018with sugar(s) and sweetener(s)\u2019 accompanies the name under which a foodstuff is sold, as provided for under Directive 94/54/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7(2)(a) and (b) of Directive 79/112/EEC shall not apply to particulars relating to the addition of vitamins and minerals, in cases where those substances are subject to nutrition labelling.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from the principle established in Article 7(4) of Directive 79/112/EEC, the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall apply to the indication of quantities of ingredients.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For foodstuffs which have lost moisture following heat treatment or other treatment, the quantity shall correspond to the quantity of the ingredient or ingredients used, related to the finished product.
