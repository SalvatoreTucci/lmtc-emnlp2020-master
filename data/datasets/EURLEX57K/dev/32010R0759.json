The provisional MRL set out for muscle should not apply to the injection site, where residue levels should not exceed 11\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg.\n(5) According to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for another species. The CVMP recommended to extrapolate the provisional MRLs for tildipirosin from bovine to caprine species.\n(6) The CVMP recommended establishing provisional MRLs for tildipirosin for porcine species, applicable to muscle, skin, fat, liver and kidney. The provisional MRL set out for muscle should not apply to the injection site, where residue levels should not exceed 7\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg.\n(7) Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the substance tildipirosin for bovine, caprine and porcine species. The provisional MRLs set out in that table for tildipirosin for bovine, caprine and porcine species should expire on 1 January 2012.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 24 October 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 August 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the following substance is inserted in alphabetical order:\nPharmacologically active substance Marker residue Animal species MRL Target tissues Other provisions Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Tildipirosin Tildipirosin Bovine, caprine 400\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption.
