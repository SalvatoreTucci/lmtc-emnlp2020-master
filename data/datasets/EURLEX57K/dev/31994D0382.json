Records should be kept and calibrations completed at regular intervals.\n2. Pressure (Chapter II only)\nPressure monitoring devices shall be installed in order to record pressure at stages in the process. Records shall be kept and calibrations completed at regular intervals.\n3. Particle size - all systems\nThis shall be monitored regularly and corrected when wear or damage to breaking equipment is noted, that could allow larger particles than defined to enter the process.\n4. For continuous systems (Chapter III - VII), a residence time test shall be completed under normal operating conditions. Such markers as Manganese dioxide (MnO2) should be introduced into the continuous systems, (at time zero).

Samples shall be taken from time zero until a time when the majority of marker is expected to have passed throughout the system."}
