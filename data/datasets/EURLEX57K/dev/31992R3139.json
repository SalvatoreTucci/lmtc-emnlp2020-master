whereas, the Community offer prices for artichokes coming from Spain and Portugal should be fixed only during the period where reference prices are fixed with  regard to third countries, this means from 1 November up to and including 30 June of the following year;\nWhereas, in accordance with Articles 152 (2) (a) and 318 (1) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each Member State of the Community of Ten, plus  transport and packaging costs incurred by the products from the production regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and bearing in mind developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetable sector; whereas the  abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied for  third countries;\nWhereas, in order to take account of seasonal variations in prices, the marketing year should be divided into one or more periods and a Community offer price should be fixed for each of them;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulations (EEC) No 3709/89 and (EEC) No 3648/90, the producer prices to be used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product defined by its commercial characteristics  recorded on the representative market or markets located in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter and which  meet quality Class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared  with the normal fluctuations recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive variations with respect of normal price fluctuations, it shall not be taken into account;\nWhereas Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1677/85 provides that agricultural prices fixed in ecus must be reduced when the amendment of the agricultural conversion rate takes effect at the beginning of the marketing year following a monetary realignment,  as a result of the dismantlement of transferred monetary gaps; whereas, because of automatic dismantlement of the negative monetary gaps created by the realignments of 13 to 17 September 1992, it is necessary to divide the prices in ecus by the  coefficient reducing agricultural prices fixed at 1,002650 by Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2735/92 (6);\nWhereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices being fixed for artichokes for the period 1 November 1992 to 30 June 1993;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 1992/93 marketing year, the Community offer price for artichokes (CN code 0709 10 00) applicable with regard to Spain and Portugal, expressed in ecus per 100 kilograms net of packed products of Class I, of all sizes, shall be as  follows:\n- from 1 November to\n31 December 1992: 89,75,\n- from 1 January to\n30 April 1993: 73,04,\n- May 1993 60,96,\n- June 1993 47,45.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 November 1992.
