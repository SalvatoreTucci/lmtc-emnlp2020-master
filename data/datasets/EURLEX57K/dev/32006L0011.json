In order to clarify matters, a codification of the provisions in question should be drawn up.\n(2) There is a need for general and simultaneous action by the Member States to protect the aquatic environment of the Community from pollution, particularly that caused by certain persistent, toxic and bioaccumulable substances.\n(3) Several conventions are designed to protect international watercourses and the marine environment from pollution. It is important to ensure the coordinated implementation of these conventions.\n(4) Discrepancies between the provisions applicable in the various Member States with regard to the discharge of certain dangerous substances into the aquatic environment may give rise to unequal conditions of competition and thus have a direct influence on the functioning of the internal market.\n(5) Decision No\u00a01600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\u00a0July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme\u00a0(5), provides for a number of measures to protect fresh water and sea water from certain pollutants.\n(6) In order to ensure effective protection of the aquatic environment of the Community, it is necessary to establish a first list, called List I, of certain individual substances selected mainly on the basis of their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation, with the exception of those which are biologically harmless or which are rapidly converted into substances which are biologically harmless, and a second list, called List II, containing substances which have a deleterious effect on the aquatic environment, which can, however, be confined to a given area and which depends on the characteristics and location of the water into which such substances are discharged. Any discharge of these substances should be subject to prior authorisation which specifies emission standards.\n(7) Pollution through the discharge of the various dangerous substances within List I must be eliminated. Limit values were fixed by the Directives referred to in Annex\u00a0IX to Directive\u00a02000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\u00a0October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy\u00a0(6). Article\u00a016 of Directive\u00a02000/60/EC provides for the procedures for developing the control measures and environmental quality standards applicable to priority substances.\n(8) It is necessary to reduce water pollution caused by the substances within List II. To this end Member States should establish programmes which incorporate environmental quality standards for water, drawn up in compliance with Council Directives, where they exist. The emission standards applicable to such substances should be calculated in terms of these environmental quality standards.\n(9) It is appropriate for one or more Member States to be able, individually or jointly, to take measures more stringent than those provided for under this Directive.\n(10) An inventory of discharges of certain particularly dangerous substances into the aquatic environment of the Community should be drawn up in order to know where they originated.\n(11) It may be necessary to revise and, where required, supplement Lists I and II of Annex\u00a0I on the basis of experience, if appropriate by transferring certain substances from List II to List\u00a0I.\n(12) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex\u00a0II,", "main_body": ["Subject to Article\u00a07, this Directive shall apply to:\n(a) inland surface water;\n(b) territorial waters;\n(c) internal coastal waters.", "For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) \u2018inland surface water\u2019 means all static or flowing fresh surface water situated in the territory of one or more Member States;\n(b) \u2018internal coastal waters\u2019 means waters on the landward side of the base line from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, extending, in the case of watercourses, up to the fresh water limit;\n(c) \u2018fresh water limit\u2019 means the place in the watercourse where, at low tide and in a period of low fresh water flow, there is an appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of sea water;\n(d) \u2018discharge\u2019 means the introduction into the waters referred to in Article\u00a01 of any substances in List I or List II of Annex\u00a0I, with the exception of:\n(i) discharges of dredgings;\n(ii) operational discharges from ships in territorial waters;\n(iii) dumping from ships in territorial waters;\n(e) \u2018pollution\u2019 means the discharge by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the aquatic environment, the results of which are such as to cause hazards to human health, harm to living resources and to aquatic ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of water.", "Member States shall take the appropriate steps to eliminate pollution of the waters referred to in Article\u00a01 by the dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances in List I of Annex\u00a0I, hereinafter referred to as \u2018List I substances\u2019, and to reduce pollution of the said waters by the dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances in List II of Annex\u00a0I, hereinafter referred to as \u2018List II substances\u2019, in accordance with this Directive.", "With regard to List I substances:\n(a) all discharges into the waters referred to in Article\u00a01 which are liable to contain any such substance, shall require prior authorisation by the competent authority of the Member State concerned;\n(b) the authorisation shall lay down emission standards with regard to discharges of any such substance into the waters referred to in Article\u00a01 and, where this is necessary for the implementation of this Directive, to discharges of any such substance into sewers;\n(c) authorisations may be granted for a limited period only.
