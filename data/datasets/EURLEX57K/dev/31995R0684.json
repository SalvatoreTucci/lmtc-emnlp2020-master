Once entitlement to the payment is established, payment of the advance shall be made.\nHowever, the advance may be paid before entitlement has been established where a security equal to  the amount of the advance, plus 10  %, has been lodged by the processing undertaking. Such security  shall cover any other security that may have been lodged in accordance with the first or second  indent of the first subparagraph. That security shall be reduced to the level provided for under  the said first or second indent as soon as entitlement to aid is established and shall be totally  released on the payment of the balance.\n2.  In order to qualify for an advance payment, the dried fodder in question must have left the  processing undertaking.\n3.  Where an advance has been made, a balance shall be paid equal to the difference, if any,  between the amount of the advance and the total amount of aid due to the undertaking processing  dried fodder, taking into account Article 5.\n4.  Where an advance has been made which exceeds the total payment to which the undertaking  processing dried fodder is entitled, taking into account Article 5, the undertaking shall repay to  the competent authority of the Member State, on demand, such part of the advance as constituted an  overpayment.` 2.  In Article 18 (a), the following indent shall be added after the second indent:\n'-  the release of securities referred to in Article 6 (1).` 3.
