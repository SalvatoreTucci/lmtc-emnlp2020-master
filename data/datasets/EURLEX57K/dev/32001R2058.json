Article 3(1)(c) stipulates that area payments for arable crops must be paid solely on areas on which the crop is maintained until at least the beginning of flowering under conditions of normal growth.\n(2) After maize seed was mixed with genetically modified maize seed not authorised within the meaning of Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/35/EC(6), certain producers in Austria were forced to destroy their maize crops. These crops could therefore not be maintained until flowering stage for reasons beyond the producers control. In order not to unduly penalise those producers they should be allowed to derogate from Article 3(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["For the 2001/02 marketing year, by derogation from Article 3(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999, land in Austria sown to maize seed mixed with genetically modified maize seed not authorised within the meaning of Directive 90/220/EEC on which the plants were destroyed prior to the beginning of the flowering stage shall continue to be eligible for area payments.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 280, 30.10.1999, p. 43.\n(4) OJ L 157, 14.6.2001, p. 8.\n(5) OJ L 117, 8.5.1990, p. 15.\n(6) OJ L 169, 27.6.1997, p. 72."}
