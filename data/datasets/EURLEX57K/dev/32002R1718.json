However, the Agreement should be interpreted as an extension on an annual basis of the Community tariff quotas. Commission Regulation (EC) No 541/2002 should therefore be amended so that the quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 2603/2001 and not used are included in the Community tariff quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 541/2002.
