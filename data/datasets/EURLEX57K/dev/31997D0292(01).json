The amount of this compensation may not exceed ECU 918,23 per fisherman per month, for a maximum of six months, and can be paid only for 1996, 1997 and 1998. To qualify for this compensation, fishermen must undertake to cease this fishing activity or to convert to another activity in 1997, 1998 or 1999, in conformity with the Italian plan;\n(b) to vessel owners who have undertaken to cease definitively all fishing activity. The aid shall be as set out in Table A in the Annex;\n(c) to vessel owners who have undertaken to diversify definitively towards another fishing activity. The premium for diversifying shall be as set out in Table B in the Annex.", "Fishermen referred to under Article 1 (a) may also qualify for:\n- aid up to a maximum of ECU 50 000 when they cease all economic activity. This aid is additional to the contribution towards early-retirement schemes envisaged under Article 14a of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 (5), but replaces the flat rate envisaged under the same Article, under (b),\n- a conversion premium up to a maximum of ECU 20 000, in the case of conversion towards another fishing activity or towards another sector. This premium replaces the flat rate envisaged under Article 14a (b) of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93.", "The public financial contribution, including that of the Community, for projects funded under the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) allowing for the reconversion of vessel owners and fishermen who have benefited from measures under this Decision can reach a maximum of 75 % of the eligible investment in Objective 1 regions and 50 % of eligible investment in non-Objective 1 regions.", "Community participation shall be as laid down for FIFG assistance and within the funding limits for Italy under the 1994 to 1999 Structural Fund programmes (CCA-Italy Objective No 1, P. O.-P\u0102\u015eche and DOCUP-Italy, Objective No 5a-Fisheries). It may run to a maximum of 50 % of eligible investment undertaken by the Member State.", "Notwithstanding all other applicable provisions and in particular those of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 (6), the Italian authorities shall send the Commission an annual report on the implementation of the plan referred to in Article 1.\nFor the application of the national plan, the Italian authorities shall adopt the necessary provisions to prevent aid accumulation not expressly authorized by this Decision and any grant of aid not justified having regard to the commitments made by the beneficiaries for a period of at least three years.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 28 April 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nW.
