The United Kingdom is particularly concerned that, in case of such products, a dangerous situation could arise should a build up of gas occur, because the accumulated unburned gas could then ignite, causing serious injury.\n(5) On the basis of the information received in the framework of the consultation of the national authorities, of CEN and of the Committee set up by Directive 98/34/EC, no evidence was found to substantiate the risk of gas accumulation or gas explosion. Consequently, it has not been demonstrated that harmonised standard EN 613:2000 fails to meet the essential requirements of Directive 90/396/EEC,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 613:2000 \"Independent gas-fired convection heaters\", adopted by the European Committee For Standardisation (CEN) on 13 July 2000 and published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 18 July 2001, shall not be withdrawn from the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
