By Commission Implementing Decision 2012/208/EU\u00a0(3) an extension of that temporary derogation was granted until 31 December 2013.\n(2) On 22 July 2013, in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, Kenya requested a further extension of the said derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for 2\u00a0000 tonnes of tuna loins for the period from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2014. On 3 October 2013 Kenya submitted additional information together with a revised request for 1\u00a0500 tonnes of tuna loins for the period from 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2014.\n(3) According to the information provided by Kenya, supplies of tuna remain unusually low compared to normal seasonal variation and vessels owners do not want to take the risk to supply raw tuna due to piracy. Therefore, Kenya is still not able to comply with the the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 after the expiry of the derogation on 31 December 2013.\n(4) Given that the situation of Kenya with regard to tuna loins has still not improved sufficiently, an extension of the derogation is justified. The extension should be granted until 30 September 2014.\n(5) Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 6 is replaced by the following:\n(3) The Annex is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 348, 31.12.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU of 19 December 2011 on a temporary derogation from rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Kenya with regard to tuna loins (OJ L 338, 21.12.2011, p. 61).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2012/208/EU of 20 April 2012 amending Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU on a temporary derogation from rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Kenya with regard to tuna loins (OJ L 110, 24.4.2012, p. 39).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Periods Quantities\n09.1667 1604\u00a014\u00a016 Tuna loins 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 2\u00a0000\n1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012 2\u00a0000\n1.1.2013 to 31.12.2013 2\u00a0000\n1.1.2014 to 30.9.2014 1\u00a0500\u2019"}
