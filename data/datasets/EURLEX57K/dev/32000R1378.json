In the framework of the World Trade Organisation, the Commission committed itself to increasing tariff quotas for certain products in the pigmeat sector. It is necessary to specify the new quantities covered by the import arrangements from 1 July 2000.\n(2) The utilisation of import quotas for pigmeat has been generally low in recent years and the relatively high security for import licences may be one discouraging factor in trade. In order to facilitate trade of pigmeat and to harmonise the levels of securities for import licences within the meat sectors it is necessary to review the level of security.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1486/95 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
