In order to attain more effectively the objectives of adjustment of the method for the allocation of the quantities which may be exported with a refund and efficient use of the resources available, as referred to in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, it would be advisable to extend the circumstances, provided for in Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95(2), in which the Commission may take steps to restrict the issue of export licences or the lodging of applications for such licences during the reflection period for which provision is made following the lodging of applications.
