That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(2) Note (15) of the special remarks in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC refers to the validity of the provisional approval for the border inspection post at the port of Marseille Port until the conclusion of the works to upgrade those facilities to fully comply with the requirements laid down in Union legislation. That provisional approval was valid until 31 July 2011. France has informed the Commission that due to a number of delays the upgrade of the facilities will only be concluded by 1 July 2012. It is therefore appropriate to extend the provisional approval for the border inspection post at the port of Marseille Port until that date. Note (15) of the special remarks in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. For the sake of legal certainty, that amendment should apply retroactively.\n(3) Following communication from Belgium, the inspection centre \u2018Kaai 650\u2019 in the border inspection post at the port of Antwerp should be deleted from the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(4) The Commission inspection service (Food and Veterinary Office, FVO) carried out an audit in Bulgaria, following which it made a number of recommendations to that Member State. Bulgaria has communicated that the approval of the border inspection post at the road of Kapitan Andreevo should be amended to take account of those recommendations. The entry for that border inspection post should therefore be amended accordingly in the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(5) FVO carried out an audit in Greece, following which it made a number of recommendations to that Member State. Greece has communicated that the approval for the category \u2018equidae\u2019 at the border inspection post at the road of Peplos should be temporarily suspended to take account of those recommendations. The entry for that border inspection post should therefore be amended accordingly in the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(6) Following communication from Spain, the approval for the categories \u2018equidae\u2019 and \u2018ungulates\u2019 at the inspection centre \u2018Flightcare\u2019 in the border inspection post at the airport of Madrid should be deleted. The entry for that border inspection post should therefore be amended accordingly in the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(7) Italy has communicated that the border inspection post of the airport of Brescia Montichiari should be deleted from the list of entries for that Member State and that the name of one inspection centre at the border inspection post at the airport of Roma-Fiumicino should be changed. In addition, Italy requested the temporary suspension of six border inspection posts and the temporary suspension of the approval for the categories \u2018equidae\u2019 and \u2018ungulates\u2019 at the border inspection post of the port at La Spezia. Italy has also requested the temporary suspension of the authorisation for all products of animal origin intended for human consumption, packed, and for products of animal origin not intended for human consumption, packed, frozen and chilled, together with the deletion of the approval for the category \u2018other animals (including zoo animals)\u2019 at the border inspection post of the airport of Milano-Linate. The list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The Netherlands has communicated that the name of one inspection centre within the border inspection post of Rotterdam has changed. The entry for that border inspection post should therefore be amended accordingly in the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(9) Following communication from Romania, the approval for the category \u2018live animals\u2019 at one inspection centre at the border inspection post of Bucharest Henri Coand\u0103 Airport should be temporarily suspended. The entry for that border inspection post should therefore be amended accordingly in the list of entries for that Member State as set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(10) Annex II to Decision 2009/821/EC lays down the list of central units, regional units and local units in the integrated computerised veterinary system (Traces).\n(11) Following communications from Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Hungary and Austria, certain changes should be brought to the list of central, regional and local units in Traces for those Member States, laid down in Annex II to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(12) Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "The amendment set out in point (1)(a) of the Annex shall apply from 1 August 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 12.11.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) note (15) of the special remarks is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(15) = \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e 1 \u044e\u043b\u0438 2012 \u0433. \u2013 Toto schv\u00e1len\u00ed plat\u00ed pouze do 1.7.2012. \u2013 Denne godkendelse g\u00e6lder kun indtil den 1. juli 2012. \u2013 Diese Genehmigung gilt nur bis zum 1.
