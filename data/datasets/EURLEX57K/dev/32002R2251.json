Damage caused to agriculture and rural areas, including woodland, by exceptional natural disasters can constitute such problems as demonstrated by the flooding which in August 2002 caused considerable damage in various applicant countries. The Community needs to be able to respond appropriately to such exceptional natural disasters using various instruments including the pre-accession instrument set up under Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999.\n(2) When exceptional natural disasters, including those involving fires, adversely affect forests in various applicant countries, it should be possible to support certain actions in favour of that sector. Moreover, it should also be possible to take the preventive actions set out under the sixth indent of Article 30(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(3).\n(3) Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2251/2001(5), makes it possible to grant support for vocational training that contributes to the improvement of the occupational skill and competence of farmers and other persons involved in agricultural and forestry activities and their conversion. In the absence of any other pre-accession community financial instrument supporting vocational training, extending support for such training to any persons for activities that could benefit from pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development (Sapard) would contribute more effectively to the achievement of the objectives of Sapard.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2759/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
