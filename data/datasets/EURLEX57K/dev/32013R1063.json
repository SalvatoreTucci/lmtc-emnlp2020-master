Raw beet sugar is not produced as a separate product during that process and therefore cannot be marketed. For that reason, it is desirable to allow the use of sugar beet instead of raw beet sugar as equivalent goods.\n(5) The yield of raw cane sugar should be calculated in accordance with point III(3) of Part B of Annex IV to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007\u00a0(3) because this is a specific calculation method in the sugar sector.\n(6) The references to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes in point 3 of Annex 74 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be updated because of the changes in the CN.\n(7) Point 3 of Annex 74 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Point 3 of Annex 74 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sugar\nRecourse to the use of equivalent goods is permitted between non-Union raw cane sugar (CN codes 1701\u00a013\u00a090 and/or 1701\u00a014\u00a090) and sugar beet (CN code 1212\u00a091\u00a080) under the condition that compensating products falling within CN code 1701\u00a099\u00a010 (white sugar) are obtained.\nThe equivalent quantity of raw cane sugar of standard quality as defined in point III of Part B of Annex IV to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007\u00a0(4) shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of white sugar with the coefficient 1,0869565.\nThe equivalent quantity of raw cane sugar not of standard quality shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of white sugar with a coefficient obtained by dividing 100 by the yield of raw cane sugar.
