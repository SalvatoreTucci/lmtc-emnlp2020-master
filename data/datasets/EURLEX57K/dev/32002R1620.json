The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.\n(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.\n(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.\n(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.\n(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.\n(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.\n(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.\n(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 13 September 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 September 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(4) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n(5) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 55.\n(6) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 25.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 12 September 2002 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and the \"A\" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10: All destinations except for Estonia,\nC11: All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, and Poland,\nC12: All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Poland,\nC13: All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania,\nC14: All destinations except for Estonia and Hungary,\nC15: All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland,\nC16: All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania."}
