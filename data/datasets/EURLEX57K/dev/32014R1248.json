Such a limit was set by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 776/2014\u00a0(3). However, according to most recent estimates, the production of out-of-quota sugar is expected to reach 6\u00a0200\u00a0000 tonnes. Additional market outlets for out-of-quota sugar should therefore be ensured.\n(4) Taking into account that the WTO ceiling for exports in the 2014/2015 marketing year has not been fully used, it is appropriate to increase the export quantitative limit of out-of-quota sugar by 700\u00a0000 tonnes, so as to provide additional business opportunities for the Union producers of sugar.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 776/2014 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) To allow the lodging of applications for out-of-quota sugar export licences, the suspension of the lodging of applications provided for in Article 1(3) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1061/2014\u00a0(4) should be abolished. As Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1061/2014 has exhausted its effects, it is appropriate to repeal it.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 776/2014, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2014/2015 marketing year, the quantitative limit referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 139(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall be 1\u00a0350\u00a0000 tonnes for exports without refund of out-of-quota white sugar falling within CN code 1701\u00a099.\u2019", "Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1061/2014 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 November 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0178, 1.7.2006, p.\u00a024.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 776/2014 of 16 July 2014 fixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2014/2015 marketing year (OJ L\u00a0210, 17.7.2014, p.\u00a011).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1061/2014 of 8 October 2014 fixing an acceptance percentage for the issuing of export licences, rejecting export-licence applications and suspending the lodging of export-licence applications for out-of-quota sugar (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0293, 9.10.2014, p.\u00a024)."}
