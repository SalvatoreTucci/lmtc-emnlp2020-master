A permanent restriction on DMF in articles is currently being considered to be incorporated in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5). As that measure will address the same concerns as Decision 2009/251/EC, for legal certainty, Decision 2009/251/EC should apply until the permanent restriction under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 enters into force.\n(4) In the light of the experience acquired so far and the absence of a permanent measure addressing consumer products containing DMF, it is necessary to extend the validity of Decision 2009/251/EC for a further 12 months.\n(5) Decision 2009/251/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 15 of Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["Article 4 of Decision 2009/251/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 4\nPeriod of application\nThis Decision shall apply until entry into force of the Commission Regulation amending Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning DMF or 15 March 2013, whichever is the earlier.\u2019", "Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision by 15 March 2012 at the latest and shall publish those measures.
