whereas, however, application of those concessions is provided for only after the  countries in question have taken measures of comparable effect; whereas the aforementioned  countries have now taken such measures or will take them as soon as possible;\nWhereas the quota for live bovine animals weighing between 160 and 300 kilograms qualifying for an  80  % duty reduction is 76  500 head for the period 1 July to 31 December 1995; whereas that quota  is open to the aforementioned countries and the three Baltic states; whereas, under Commission  Regulation (EC) No 1941/95 of 4 August 1995 opening for the second half of 1995, and laying down  detailed rules for the application of, the tariff quotas for live bovine animals weighing between  160 and 300 kilograms originating in and coming from the Republic of Poland, the Republic of  Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic  (2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2017/95   (3), and under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2235/95 of 21 September 1995 determining to what  extent licence applications submitted during August 1995 for live bovine animals weighing between  160 and 300 kilograms as part of a tariff quota provided for under European agreements concluded  between the Community and the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic and  Slovakia may be accepted  (4), operators have already been authorized to import 54  100 head of  animals in that category; whereas, therefore, a quantity of 22  400 qualifying for that reduction  remains; whereas it is necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1842/95 of 26 July 1995 laying down  for 1995 detailed rules for the application to live bovine animals of the tariff quotas provided  for in the free trade Agreements between the Community, of the one part, and Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania, of the other part  (5), given the fact that the quota referred to therein is included in  the quantity of 22  400 head;\nWhereas, with a view to preventing speculation, the quantity available should be made available for  operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a  significant number of animals with countries which are considered to be third countries on 31  December 1994; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a  minimum of 50 animals should be required to have been exported or imported during 1994 by the  operators concerned; whereas a batch of 50 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and  whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement  for a transaction to be considered real and viable;\nWhereas, while recalling the provisions of the Agreements intended to guarantee product origin, the  quotas in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be set  on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, by way  of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988  laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and  advance fixing certificates for agricultural products  (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No  2137/95  (7), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application  for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No  2377/80  (8); whereas it should moreover be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a  reflection period and where necessary with a flat-rate percentage reduction applied;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
