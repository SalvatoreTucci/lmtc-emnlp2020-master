Studies and tests carried out in the framework of that examination indicate that the determination of the starch/glucose content by solubilisation by means of sodium hydroxide (prior to enzymatic degradation to glucose) and the measurement of the total glucose content using the enzymatic method with spectrophotometry as prescribed for most goods now, do not meet any longer the current technical requirements and are therefore to be updated.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to provide that the degradation of starch/glucose is to be carried out in an enzymatic way by amylase and amyloglucosidase and that the total glucose content is to be determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and to specify how the enzymatic method is to be carried out.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 900/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 900/2008 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 248, 17.9.2008, p. 8.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 187, 26.7.1996, p. 18.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nEnzymatic determination of starch and its degradation products including glucose in food products using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope\nThis method describes the determination of the content of starch and its degradation products including glucose in food products for human consumption hereafter referred to as \u201cstarch\u201d. The starch content is determined from the quantitative analysis of glucose by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after enzymatic conversion of starch and its degradation products into glucose.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definition of the total glucose content and of the total glucose content expressed as starch\nThe total glucose content means the value Z as calculated in point 7.2.1 of this Annex. It represents the content of starch and all its degradation products, glucose included.\nThe starch/glucose content as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1460/96 shall be calculated on the basis of the total glucose content Z and as set out in Article 2 point 1 of this Regulation.\nThe starch (or dextrin) content as referred to in column 3 of Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005\u00a0(1) shall be calculated on the basis of the total glucose content Z as set out in Article 2 point 2.1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 904/2008\u00a0(2).\nThe Starch content referred to in point 1 of this Annex means the value E, as calculated in point 7.2.2 of this Annex. It is expressed in\u00a0% (m/m). It is equivalent to the total glucose content Z, expressed as starch. This value E does not interfere in the above mentioned calculations.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principle\nThe samples are homogenised and suspended in water. The starch and its degradation products, present in the samples, are enzymatically converted into glucose in two steps:\n1. Starch and its degradation products are partially converted into soluble glucose chains using thermostable alpha-amylase at 90\u00a0\u00b0C. For effective conversion it is necessary that the samples should be completely solved or should be present in the form of a suspension containing very small solid parts\n2. The soluble glucose chains are converted into glucose using amyloglucosidase at 60\u00a0\u00b0C.\nProducts containing a high content of proteins or fat are clarified and filtrated.\nThe determination of sugars is performed by HPLC analysis.\nBecause a partial inversion of sucrose may occur during the enzymatic treatment, the determination of free sugars is also performed by HPLC analysis to calculate the corrected glucose content.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reagents and other materials\nUse reagents of recognised analytical grade and demineralised water.\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Glucose, min 99\u00a0%.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fructose, min 99\u00a0%.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sucrose, min 99\u00a0%.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maltose-monohydrate, min 99\u00a0%.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lactose-monohydrate, min 99\u00a0%.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solution of thermostable alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-D-Glucan-glucanohydrolase), with activity about 31\u00a0000\u00a0U/ml (1U will liberate 1,0\u00a0mg of maltose from starch in 3 minutes at pH 6,9 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C). This enzyme can contain a low amount of impurities (e.g. glucose or sucrose) and other interfering enzymes. Storage at ca. 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Alternatively, other sources of alpha-amylase may be used yielding a final solution with comparable enzyme activity.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amyloglucosidase (1,4-alpha-D-Glucan glucohydrolase) from Aspergillus niger, powder with activity about 120\u00a0U/mg or about 70\u00a0U/mg (1U will liberate 1 micromol glucose from starch per minute at pH 4,8 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C). This enzyme can contain a low amount of impurities (e.g. glucose or sucrose) and other interfering enzymes (e.g., Invertase). Storage at ca. 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Alternatively, other sources of amyloglucosidase may be used yielding a final solution with comparable enzyme activity.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zinc acetate dihydrate, p.a..\n4.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) (K4[Fe(CN)]6.3H2O), extra pure.\n4.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sodium acetate anhydrous, p.a..\n4.11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Glacial acetic acid, 96\u00a0% (v/v) (minimum).\n4.12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sodium acetate buffer (0,2\u00a0mol/l).

Prepare a solution of amyloglucosidase powder (point 4.7) by using sodium acetate buffer (point 4.12). The enzyme activity must be sufficient and in accordance with the starch content in the amount of sample (for example, activity about 600\u00a0U/ml is obtained from 0,5\u00a0g amyloglucosidase powder 120\u00a0U/mg (point 4.7) in a final volume of 100\u00a0ml for 1\u00a0g starch in the amount of sample).

The result of the blank determination is used in the calculation of the starch content (point 7.2).\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analysis\n6.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of the samples\nHomogenise the sample by shaking or stirring. The chosen test portion (point 6.2) is weighed into a volumetric flask (point 5.5) and about 70\u00a0ml warm water is added.\nAfter dissolving or suspending, add 50 microliter of thermostable alpha-amylase (point 4.6) and heat at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 min in a water bath (point 5.9). Cool as quick as possible to 60\u00a0\u00b0C in a water bath, and add 5\u00a0ml of a solution of amyloglucosidase (point 4.13). For samples which could influence the pH of the reaction solution, control the pH and adjust it to 4,6 to 4,8, if necessary. Allow to react for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Cool the samples to ambient temperature.\n6.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clarification\nFor samples with a high content of proteins or fat, clarification is necessary by adding 1\u00a0ml Carrez I (point 4.15) to the sample solution. After shaking, 1\u00a0ml Carrez II (point 4.16) is added. Shake the sample again.\n6.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Processing for HPLC analysis\nThe sample in the volumetric flask is diluted to the mark with water, homogenised and filtered through a fluted filter (point 5.2). Collect the sample extract.\nFilter the extracts through a syringe filter (point 5.3) with a syringe (point 5.6) that has been preflushed with the extract. Collect the filtrates in vials (point 5.4).\n6.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chromatography\nHPLC is performed as conventionally for analysis of sugars. If the HPLC analysis shows traces of maltose, then the starch is incompletely converted, which results in a too low recovery for glucose.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation and expression of results\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of the HPLC results\nFor the calculation of the starch content, the results of two HPLC analysis are necessary, namely sugars present in the sample before (\u2018free sugars\u2019) and after enzymatic treatment (as described in this method). Also a blank determination has to be performed to be able to correct for sugars present in the enzymes.\nIn the HPLC analysis, the peak area is determined after integration and the concentration is calculated after calibration with reference solutions (point 4.14). From the glucose concentration (g/100\u00a0ml) after enzymatic treatment, the concentration of glucose (g/100\u00a0ml) in the blank is subtracted. Eventually the content (g sugar/100\u00a0g sample) of sugars is calculated using the weighted amount of sample, which results in:\n1. HPLC analysis before enzymatic treatment, giving the content (g/100\u00a0g) of free sugars:\n\u2014 glucose G\n\u2014 fructose F\n\u2014 sucrose S\n2. HPLC analysis after enzymatic treatment, giving the content (g/100\u00a0g) of sugars:\n\u2014 glucose after correction for the blank (Ge cor)\n\u2014 fructose Fe\n\u2014 sucrose Se\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of the starch content\n7.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of total glucose \u201cZ\u201d\nIf the amount of fructose after enzymatic treatment (Fe) is higher than the amount of fructose before enzymatic treatment (F), then the sucrose, present in the sample, is partly converted into fructose and glucose. This means that a correction shall be made for the liberated glucose (Fe \u2013 F).\nZ, final glucose content after correction in g/100g:\nZ\u00a0=\u00a0(Ge cor)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(Fe \u2013 F)\n7.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of the total glucose content expressed as st\u0105rch\nE, \u201cstarch\u201d content in g/100g:\nE\u00a0=\u00a0[(Ge cor)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(Fe \u2013 F)]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00,9\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Precision\nDetails of an inter laboratory test relating to precision data of the method performed on 2 samples are given in this point.
