The area to be used when calculating the quantity of table wine or wine suitable for yielding table wine which Greek producers may cause to be distilled shall be obtained by dividing by 57 the quantity given as wine in the table wine column of the  production declaration, presented pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3929/87.", "1.
