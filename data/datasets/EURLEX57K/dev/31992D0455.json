The complaint  contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered  sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a  notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an  anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of bars and rods, hot-rolled in  irregularly wound coils (also known as wire-rod) of iron or non-alloy steel, used mainly in  building work, falling within CN codes 7213  31  00 and 7213  39  00, originating in Argentina,  Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\n(2)  The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January to 30 September 1990.\n(3)  The Commission officially so advised the exporting producers and importers known to be  concerned, the representatives of Argentina, Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey and the former  Yugoslavia and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make  known their views in writing and to request a hearing.\n(4)  The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purpose  of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following  companies:\nCommunity producers:\n-  Saarstahl AG, Voelklingen, Germany\n-  Thyssen Stahl AG, Duisburg, Germany\n-  Moselstahlwerk  GmbH & Co.
