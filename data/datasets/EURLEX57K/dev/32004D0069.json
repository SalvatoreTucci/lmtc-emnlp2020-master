Only in that way is it possible to realise the objective, in the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC, of maintaining or restoring the natural habitat types and the species' habitats concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range, which may lie across one or more frontiers inside the Community.\"\n(8) Considering that on the basis of available information and on the common assessments made within the framework of the biogeographic seminars, prepared by the European Topic Centre for Nature Protection and Biodiversity, and the bilateral meetings held with the Member States, some Member States have not proposed sufficient sites to meet the requirements of the Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species. It cannot therefore be concluded for the species and habitat types listed in Annex 2 to this decision that the network is complete. However, taking into account the delay in receiving the information and reaching agreement with the Member States, the Commission considers that it should adopt a list of sites, to be considered as initial, which will need to be completed in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Directive 92/43/EEC for the habitat types and species listed in Annex 2 to this decision for which indicated Member States have not proposed sufficient sites according to the requirements of the Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up by Article 20 of Directive 92/43/EEC,", "main_body": ["The list contained in Annex I to this Decision shall constitute the initial list of sites of Community importance for the Alpine biogeographical region in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 92/43/EEC.\nThat list is to be completed in the light of further proposals by Member States in conformity with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species, specified in Annex II to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2003.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7.
