An electrical control apparatus, known as a \u2018joystick\u2019, consisting of a plastic housing (dimensions: 8 x 8 x 5,5 cm) with, on its top, a lever and two push-buttons. Four screws and two small rollers, intended to regulate the cursor on the screen of the monitor, are situated beneath the small housing. This appliance is linked by a cable and a special connecting plug to a computer's central processing unit. The movements of the handle are transmitted to the computer by means of the resistances in two potentiometers which are located in the joystick's housing. The computer reads the resistance values, \u2018translates\u2019 them and converts them into cursor movements on the monitor screen.\n2. An electrical control apparatus, known as a \u2018mouse for computers\u2019, consisting of a housing with two switches and a connecting cable and plug. Inside the housing there is a plastic contact bearing, two rollers at 90 o to each other, a stroboscopic disc, a light source and a printed circuit board with diodes and an integrated circuit.\n3. Battery-backed integrated circuit sockets consisting of:\n\u2014 a 28-pin, dual in-line package socket measuring 18 x 36 mm,\n\u2014 not more than two lithium batteries in the socket,\n\u2014 a C-MOS controller circuit in the form of an integrated circuit filled to the socket.\n4. Laser diode modules consisting of a laser diode, optical power monitor diode, thermoelectric cooler and temperature sensor mounted in a metal housing with a fibre optic pigtail connection. The modules are used in fibre optic telephone line equipment to convert electrical signals into light signals for transmission through a fibre optic cable.\n5. A socket for cathode ray tubes consisting of two interlocking plastic components, one of which houses several metallic conducting terminals. The socket is for attachment to the base of a cathode ray tube in order to enable this tube to be easily connected to the circuitry of the television receiver.\n6. An ice storage bin for the storage of ice cubes. These bins consist of a shaped-frame structure and incorporate an internal container made of steel sheet. The bins are double skinned with a layer of foam plastic between the skins."}
