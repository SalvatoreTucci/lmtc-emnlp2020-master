The funds allocated to the Member States for the period 2000 to 2006 also cover that expenditure.\n(4) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 of 16 February 1996 on data to be forwarded by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2761/1999(5) states that for year n, account is to be taken of expenditure effected by the Member States from 16 October of year n-1 to 15 October of year n. As a consequence, expenditure incurred by the EAGGF Guarantee Section on measures under Regulations (EEC) No 2078/92, (EEC) No 2079/92 and (EEC) No 2080/92 since 16 October 1999 fall within the 2000 budget year and must be taken into account under the allocation for the period 2000 to 2006. Furthermore, payments made by the paying agencies from 16 October to 31 December 2006 are to be charged against the 2007 budget year.\n(5) It also transpires that the table in the Annex to the Decision laying down the initial allocations to the Member States does not allow the annual budget ceilings to be calculated accurately. That table should accordingly be replaced by a more detailed table setting out the amounts not to be exceeded by each Member State per year,", "main_body": ["Decision 1999/659/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
