In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.\n(2) Gyrodactylus salaris is an external parasite of salmonids which is able to cause serious mortalities in Salmo salar.\n(3) Experience has shown that the disease can spread from infected regions to previously uninfected regions through commercial transfers of salmon and other salmonids. The disease can also spread between rivers through natural migration of salmonids.\n(4) It is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease from regions in the Community possibly infected with Gyrodactylus salaris.\n(5) The introduction of the parasite into regions with salmon stocks which are highly susceptible to Gyrodactylus salaris could lead to important losses of such salmon. It is therefore necessary to lay down the measures necessary to prevent such introduction.\n(6) Procedures should be established in order to protect regions with highly susceptible salmon stocks or which are presumably free of Gyrodactylus salaris.\n(7) The Member States to which protective measures with regard to Gyrodactylus salaris apply, have a testing and surveillance programme for Gyrodactylus salaris in place. The results thereof should be regularly communicated to the Commission.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The introduction into the regions referred to in Annex I of live salmonids originating from outside these regions shall not be allowed.", "The introduction of salmonid ova for breeding purposes into the regions referred to in Annex I originating from outside these regions, shall be subject to the application to the ova of disinfection procedures ensuring the elimination of parasites belonging to the species Gyrodactylus salaris.", "1.
