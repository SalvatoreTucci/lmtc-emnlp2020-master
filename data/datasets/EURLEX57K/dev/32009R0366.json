That objection is based on points (a), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation. In its statement of objection, Sweden took the view that the conditions for registration referred to in Article 2 of that Regulation are not met, that registration of the name in question is injurious to names, trade marks or existing goods and that the name in question is generic.\n(3) The Commission considered that objection to be admissible and, by letter of 4 August 2008, asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.\n(4) An agreement, notified to the Commission on 27 February 2009, was concluded between Finland and Sweden within six months. Under that agreement, Sweden does not have an objection to registration of the name \u2018Lapin Poron liha\u2019. It was agreed that the detailed rules for the labelling of reindeer meat or products based on reindeer meat originating in Swedish Lapland should be made in compliance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.\n(5) That agreement does not amend the information published pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The name \u2018Lapin Poron liha\u2019 should therefore be registered in accordance with Article 7(4) of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The name contained in the Annex to this Regulation is hereby entered in the register.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 May 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 19, 25.1.2008, p. 22.\nANNEX\nAgricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty:\nClass 1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fresh meat (and offal)\nFINLAND\nLapin Poron liha (PDO)"}
