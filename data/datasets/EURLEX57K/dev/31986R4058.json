whereas the Member States affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as being an essential feature of the dry and liquid bulk trades and are convinced that the introduction of cargo-sharing in these trades will have a serious effect on the trading interests of all countries by substantially increasing transportation costs;\nWhereas the restriction of access to bulk cargoes would adversely affect the merchant fleets of the Member States, as well as substantially increasing the transportation costs of such cargoes, and would thereby have a serious effect on the trading interests of the Community;\nWhereas the Community should be enabled to provide for coordinated action by Member States if the competitive position of Member States' merchant fleets or Member States' trading interests are adversely affected by cargo reservation to shipping companies of third countries or if required by an international agreement;\nWhereas Council Decision 77/587/EEC\u00a0(3) provides, inter alia, for consultation on the various aspects of developments which have taken place in relations between Member States and third countries in shipping matters;\nWhereas Council Decision 83/573/EEC\u00a0(4) provides, inter alia, for concertation by Member States of any countermeasures they may take in relation to third countries and for the possibility of a decision on the joint application by Member States of appropriate countermeasures forming part of their national legislation;\nWhereas it is necessary to elaborate and refine the machinery provided for in these Decisions with a view to providing for coordinated action by Member States in certain circumstances at the request of a Member State or Member States or on the basis of an international agreement,", "main_body": ["The procedure provided for by this Regulation shall be applicable when action by a third country or by its agents restricts or threatens to restrict free access by shipping companies of Member States or by ships registered in a Member State in accordance with its legislation to the transport of:\n\u2014 liner cargoes in Code trades, except where such action is taken in accordance with the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences;\n\u2014 liner cargoes in non-Code trades;\n\u2014 bulk cargoes and any other cargo on tramp services;\n\u2014 passengers;\n\u2014 persons or goods to or between offshore installations.\nThis procedure shall be without prejudice to the obligations of the Community and its Member States under international law.", "For the purposes of this Regulation:\n\u2014 \u2018home-trader\u2019 means a shipping company of a third country which operates a service between its own country and one or more Member States;\n\u2014 \u2018cross-trader\u2019 means a shipping company of a third country which operates a service between another third country and one or more Member States.", "Coordinated action may be requested by a Member State.\nThe request shall be made to the Commission;
