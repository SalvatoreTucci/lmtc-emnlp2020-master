According to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters, duty free imports of goods of the CN codes 2202\u00a010\u00a000 and ex\u00a02202\u00a090\u00a010 originating in Norway are to be permitted only within the limits of a duty free quota while a duty is to be paid for imports outside the quota allocation.\n(4) Furthermore, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters requires that the products in question be granted unlimited duty-free access to the Union if the tariff quota has not been exhausted by 31 October of the previous year. According to data provided to the Commission, the annual quota for 2013 for the waters and beverages in question opened by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1085/2012\u00a0(7) had not been exhausted by 31 October 2013. Therefore, the products in question should be granted unlimited duty free access to the Union from 1 January to 31 December 2014.\n(5) It is therefore necessary not to apply for 2014 the temporary suspension of the duty free regime applied under Protocol No 2 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway of 14 May 1973.\n(6) For reasons of legal certainty, it is appropriate to repeal provisions of Union law which no longer produce legal effects with regard to present or future situations. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1085/2012 should therefore be repealed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 January to 31 December 2014, the goods classified under CN codes 2202\u00a010\u00a000 (waters, including mineral waters and aerated waters, containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured) and ex\u00a02202\u00a090\u00a010 (other non-alcoholic beverages containing sugar (sucrose or invert sugar)) originating in Norway shall be granted unlimited duty free access to the Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the goods referred to in paragraph 1 shall be those set out in Protocol No 3 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway of 14 May 1973.", "Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1085/2012 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 370, 17.12.2004, p. 70.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 27.6.1973, p. 2.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 140/2001 of 23 November 2001 amending Protocols 2 and 3 to the EEA Agreement, concerning processed and other agricultural products (OJ L 22, 24.1.2002, p. 34).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 138/2004 of 29 October 2004 amending Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement, concerning products referred to in Article 8(3)(b) of the Agreement (OJ L 342, 18.11.2004, p. 30).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 370, 17.12.2004, p. 72.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1085/2012 of 20 November 2012 opening the tariff quota for the year 2013 for the importation into the European Union of certain goods originating in Norway resulting from the processing of agricultural products covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 (OJ L 322, 21.11.2012, p. 2)."}
