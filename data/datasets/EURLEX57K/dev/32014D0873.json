It is therefore no longer necessary to test each consignment, in particular, with a view to detecting the presence of chloramphenicol.\n(7) Decision 2002/249/EC should therefore be repealed accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/249/EC is hereby repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a031, 1.2.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2002/249/EC of 27 March 2002 concerning certain protective measures with regard to certain fishery and aquaculture products intended for human consumption and imported from Myanmar (OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 73)."}
