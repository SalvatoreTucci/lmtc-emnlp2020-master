Member States may request the Commission to add species to that Annex.\n(3) Before the entry into force of that Regulation, certain Member States requested the addition of certain species to Annex IV. France has proposed, in respect of its outermost regions, the addition of certain species to be included in a separate part of that Annex.\n(4) The Commission convened a group of experts on 7 November 2007 and on 30 and 31 January 2008, in order to assess the eligibility of those species to be included in Annex IV to that Regulation. A new list of species was therefore established to that end.\n(5) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 28.6.2007, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX IV\nList of species foreseen by Article 2(5)\nPART A \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nAcipenser baeri\n\u00a0(1), Siberian sturgeon\nA. gueldenstaeti\n\u00a0(1), Russian sturgeon\nA. nudiventris\n\u00a0(1), Fringebarbel sturgeon\nA. ruthenus\n\u00a0(1), Sterlet sturgeon\nA. stellatus\n\u00a0(1), Starry sturgeon\nA. sturio\n\u00a0(1), Atlantic sturgeon\nAristichthys nobilis, Big head carp\nCarassius auratus, Goldfish\nClarias gariepinus, African catfish\nCoregonus peled, Northern Whitefish\nCrassostrea gigas, Pacific cupped oyster\nCtenopharyngodon idella, Grass carp\nCyprinus carpio, Common carp\nHuso huso\n\u00a0(1), Beluga sturgeon\nHypophthalmichthys molitrix, Silver carp\nIctalurus punctatus, Channel catfish\nMicropterus salmoides, Large-mouth bass\nOncorhynchus mykiss, Rainbow trout\nRuditapes philippinarum, Japanese or Manila clam\nSalvelinus alpinus, Arctic char\nSalvelinus fontinalis, Brook trout\nSalvelinus namaycush, Great lake trout\nSander lucioperca, Pikeperch\nSilurus glanis, European catfish\nPART B \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0French overseas departments\nMacrobrachium rosenbergii, Giant river prawn\nOreochromis mossambicus, Mozambique tilapia\nO. niloticus, Nile tilapia\nSciaenops ocellatus, Red drum\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Hybrids of sturgeon species.\u0219"}
