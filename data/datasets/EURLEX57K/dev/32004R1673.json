Commission Regulation (EEC) No 410/90 of 16 February 1990 setting quality standards for kiwifruit\u00a0(2) has been amended several times. For the sake of clarity, Regulation (EEC) No 410/90 should therefore be repealed and replaced, as from 1 October 2004, by a new Regulation.\n(2) To that end, and in the interest of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the UN/ECE standard FFV-46 concerning marketing and quality control of kiwifruit recommended by the Working Party on Agricultural Quality Standards of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).\n(3) Application of the new standards should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve profitability.\n(4) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause some degree of deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch.\n(5) As products in the \u2018Extra\u2019 class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged, only lack of freshness and turgidity should be taken into account in their case.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The marketing standards applicable to kiwifruit falling within CN code 0810\u00a050 shall be as set out in the Annex.\nThe standards shall apply to all marketing stages under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\nHowever, at stages following dispatch, products may show, in relation to the requirements of the standard:\n(a) a slight lack of freshness and turgidity;\n(b) for products graded in classes other than the \u2018Extra\u2019 class, slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish.", "Regulation (EEC) No 410/90 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply as from 1 October 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 September 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.
