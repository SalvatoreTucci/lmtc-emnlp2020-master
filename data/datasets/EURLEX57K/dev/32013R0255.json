The submission of a notification requires completion of the notification and movement documents as set out in Annexes IA and IB to that Regulation. Wastes listed in Annex IIIA, IIIB or IVA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 can be identified in Block 14 of Annex IA or Annex IB, under subheading (vi) \u2018Other (specify)\u2019. Annex IC to that Regulation, providing specific instructions for completing either Annex IA or IB needs to be amended in order to clarify how those wastes should be indicated in Annex IA or IB.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 also specifies under which conditions wastes listed in Annexes IIIA and IIIB to that Regulation need to be accompanied by the document contained in Annex VII to that Regulation when these wastes are intended for shipment. As Block 10 of Annex VII does not provide the option to identify wastes listed in Annexes IIIA and IIIB, such wastes cannot be properly identified in Annex VII. The inclusion of wastes in Annexes IIIA and IIIB necessitates the expansion of the options listed in Block 10 of Annex VII.\n(3) At the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal which took place from 17 to 21 October 2011, technical guidelines and guidance documents on environmentally sound management were adopted. Following their adoptions, Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 needs to be updated accordingly.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) Annex IC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation;\n(2) Annex VII is replaced by the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n(3) Annex VIII is replaced by the text set out in Annex III to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 190, 12.7.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3.\nANNEX I\nAnnex IC to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 is amended as follows:\n(a) In point 25(c), the second sentence is deleted.\n(b) In point 25(d), the second sentence is deleted.\n(c) In point 25(e), the following paragraph is added:\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX VII\nINFORMATION ACCOMPANYING SHIPMENTS OF WASTE AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 3(2) AND (4)\nANNEX III\n\u2018ANNEX VIII\nGUIDELINES ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MANAGEMENT (ARTICLE 49)\nI.
