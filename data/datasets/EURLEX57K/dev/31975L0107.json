P. FOURCADE\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No C 56, 2. 6. 1972, p. 35.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No C 123, 27. 11. 1972, p. 7.\nANNEX I\n1. Measuring container bottles shall be characterized by the following capacities which are always specified for a temperature of 20oC:\n1.1. the nominal capacity Vn is the volume which is marked on the bottle; it is the volume of liquid which the latter is deemed to contain when it is filled in the conditions of use for which it is intended;\n1.2. the brim capacity of a bottle is the volume of liquid it contains when filled to the brim;\n1.3. the actual capacity of a bottle is the volume of liquid it in fact contains when it is filled exactly under the conditions corresponding theoretically to the nominal capacity;\n2. There are two methods of filling measuring container bottles:\n(1) to a constant level,\n(2) to a constant vacuity.\n3. In order to make it possible, allowing for the usual uncertainties in filling, to measure the volume of the contents of measuring container bottles with sufficient accuracy, and in particular with the accuracy required by the Directives on prepackages, the maximum permissible errors (positive or negative) in the capacity of a measuring bottle container, i.e. the greatest differences permitted (positive or negative) at a temperature of 20oC and under the control conditions laid down in Annex II, between the actual capacity and the nominal capacity Vn shall be in accordance with the following table:\nNominal capacity Vn in millilitres Maximum permissible errors\nas a % of Vn in millilitres\nfrom 50 to 100 \u2014 3\nfrom 100 to 200 3 \u2014\nfrom 200 to 300 \u2014 6\nfrom 300 to 500 2 \u2014\nfrom 500 to 1\u00a0000 \u2014 10\nfrom 1\u00a0000 to 5\u00a0000 1 \u2014\n4. In practice, the actual capacity of a measuring container bottle shall be checked by determining the quantity of water at 20oC which the bottle actually contains when filled to the level theoretically corresponding to the nominal capacity. It may also be checked indirectly by a method of equivalent accuracy.\n5. Every manufacturer of measuring container bottles shall submit for the approval of the competent department a mark by which he can be identified.\n6. The competent departments of the Member States shall check that the measuring container bottles comply with the provisions of this Directive by sampling at the place of manufacture or, if this is not practicable, on the premises of the importer or his agent established in the Community.\n7. This Directive shall not preclude any checks that may be carried out by the competent departments of the Member States in the course of trade.\n8. A measuring container bottle shall bear the following indelible, easily legible and visible indications:\n8.1. on its side, on the bottom rim or on the bottom:\n8.1.1. an indication of its nominal capacity in litres, centilitres or millilitres in figures at least 6 mm high, if the nominal capacity is greater than 100 cl, 4 mm high if it is from 100 cl down to but not including 20 cl and 3 mm high if it is not more than 20 cl, followed by the symbol for the unit of measurement used or, where appropriate, by the name of the unit in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive No 71/354/EEC\u00a0(3) of 18 October 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement, as amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties;\n8.1.2. the manufacturer's identifying mark prescribed in the first paragraph of Section 5;\n8.1.3. the sign prescribed in the third paragraph of Section 5;\n8.2. On the bottom or on the bottom rim, in such a manner as to avoid confusion with the previous indication, in figures of the same minimum height as those expressing the corresponding nominal capacity, according to the method or methods of filling for which the bottle is intended:\n8.2.1. an indication of the brim capacity expressed in centilitres and not followed by the symbol cl,\n8.2.2. and/or an indication of the distance in millimetres from the brim level to the filling level corresponding to the nominal capacity, followed by the symbol mm.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 202, 6. 9. 1971, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 73, 27. 3. 1972, p. 14.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 243, 29. 10. 1971, p. 29.\nANNEX II\nThis Annex lays down the procedures for the statistical checking of measuring container bottles in order to meet the requirements of Article 2 of the Directive and of Section 6 of Annex I.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0METHOD OF SAMPLING\nA sample of measuring container bottles of the same design and the same manufacture shall be drawn from a batch corresponding, in principle, to an hour's production.\nIf the result of the check on a batch corresponding to an hour's production is not satisfactory, a second test can be carried out, based either on another sample from a batch corresponding to a longer period of production or, where production has been subject to a check recognized by the competent departments of the Member State, on the results recorded on the manufacturers' check-cards.\nThe number of measuring container bottles constituting the sample shall be 35 or 40, depending on which of the two methods of applying the results, detailed in Section 3 below, has been chosen by each Member State.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MEASURING THE CAPACITY OF THE MEASURING CONTAINER BOTTLES CONSTITUTING THE SAMPLE\nThe measuring container bottles shall be weighed empty.\nThey shall be filled with water at 20oC of a know density, up to the filling level appropriate to the method of checking used.\nThey shall then be weighed in full.\nThe check shall be carried out by means of a legal measuring instrument, suitable for effecting the necessary operations.\nError in measuring the capacity shall not be great er than one-fifth of the maximum permissible error corresponding to the nominal capacity of the measuring container bottle.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0APPLICATION OF THE RESULTS\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use of the standard deviation method\nThe number of measuring container bottles in the sample is 35.\n3.1.1.
