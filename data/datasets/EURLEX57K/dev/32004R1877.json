It is important at this stage to support the political and economic reforms undertaken in this state and to keep the country well on track towards the European Union\u2019s Stabilisation and Association process.\n(3) Improving trade opportunities for Serbia and Montenegro in areas in which the country possesses comparative economic advantages is of great importance to underpin the country\u2019s economic and political reforms and to further its integration into European structures.\n(4) The proposed increase is part of an overall process of promoting closer trade relations with Serbia and Montenegro, which includes the negotiations on a textiles agreement with Serbia and Montenegro to achieve bilateral liberalisation.\n(5) It is therefore important to improve market access specifically for textiles and to review the quotas currently applicable on imports of textile products originating in Serbia and Montenegro. This further improvement reflects the overall progress achieved so far in the technical talks leading to the negotiation of a textile agreement, and the Agreed Minutes signed on 15 June 2004.\n(6) Further imports within the EU of certain categories of textile products are presently no longer possible because the respective quotas have been exhausted. Serbia and Montenegro, as well as Member States, has requested that the quotas be increased.\n(7) It is appropriate to increase the levels of quotas for Serbia and Montenegro in order to absorb pending import requests for categories 6, 7 and 15, and for category 16 where the quantitative limits are nearly exhausted.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textiles Committee, as referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["Annex IIIB to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 is replaced as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nPascal LAMY\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 1, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2309/2003 (OJ L 342, 30.12.2003, p. 21).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX III B\nAnnual Community quantitative limits referred to in the fourth indent of Article 2(1)\nSerbia and Montenegro\nCategory Unit Quantity\n1 tonnes 2\u00a0350\n2 tonnes 2\u00a0853\n2a tonnes 645\n3 tonnes 312\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0326\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces 713\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces 386\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0109\n9 tonnes 292\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces 552\n16 1\u00a0000 pieces 279\n67 tonnes 244\u2019"}
