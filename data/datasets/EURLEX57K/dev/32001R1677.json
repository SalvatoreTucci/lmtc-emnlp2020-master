PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\n(1) On 31 August 1996, by means of two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(3) and an anti-subsidy proceeding(4) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway.\n(2) These proceedings resulted in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(5) and 1891/97(6) in September 1997 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation.\n(3) In parallel to this, by Decision 97/634/EC(7), the Commission accepted undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters and imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway (\"the product concerned\") exported to the Community by these companies were exempted from the said anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\n(4) The form of the duties was later reviewed and Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and (EC) No 1891/97 were replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(8).\nB. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING\n(5) The undertakings offered by the Norwegian companies oblige them, inter alia, to provide the Commission with detailed quarterly reports of their sales to the Community of the product concerned. These reports should be received by the Commission no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter in question.\n(6) For the fourth quarter of 2000, two Norwegian companies, Marstein Seafood AS (UT No 1/93, TARIC additional code 8197 ) and Westmarine AS (UT No 1/192, TARIC additional code 8625 ), failed to present their sales reports within the prescribed time limit, offering no explanation whatsoever for this failure. The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Commission Decision 2001/644/EC of 20 July 2001 amending Decision 97/634/EC accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings concerning imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway(9).\n(7) As breaches of the undertakings have been found to have occurred, acceptance of the undertakings has been withdrawn by the Commission. Definitive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties should therefore be imposed forthwith against the two companies concerned.\nC. NEW EXPORTERS AND CHANGES OF NAME\n(8) Two Norwegian companies, Atlantis AS and Cape Fish AS, claimed that they are \"new exporters\" within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 in conjunction with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, and have offered undertakings. Having investigated the matter, it was established that the applicants fulfilled the conditions for being considered as new exporters and, accordingly, the undertakings offered have been accepted by the Commission. The exemption to the anti-dumping and countervailing duties should therefore be extended to these companies.\n(9) A Norwegian exporter with an undertaking advised the Commission that the group of companies to which it belongs had been re-organised and that another company within the group was now responsible for exports to the Community. The company therefore requested that its name be replaced on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC and on the list of companies which benefit from an exemption to the anti-dumping and countervailing duties in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999.\n(10) Two other exporters advised the Commission that their names had changed and also requested that the lists of companies mentioned in the previous recital be amended.\n(11) Having verified the nature of these requests, the Commission considered them all to acceptable since the changes do not entail any substantive changes requiring a re-assessment of dumping, nor do they affect any of the considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking was based. The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Commission Decision 2001/644/EC.\nD. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999\n(12) In view of all the above, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 which lists the companies exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 shall be replaced by the Annex hereto.", "1.
