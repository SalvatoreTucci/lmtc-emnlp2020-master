That Strategy underlined that, in order to minimise the risk posed by the illicit trade in and excessive accumulation of SALW, particular attention should be paid to the enormous accumulations of SALW stockpiled in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, and the ways by which they are disseminated in conflict zones.\n(2) The EU SALW Strategy identifies among its objectives the fostering of effective multilateralism so as to forge mechanisms, whether international, regional or within the Union and its Member States, for countering the supply and destabilising spread of SALW and their ammunition. In its Action Plan, the Strategy singles out the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as one of the regional organisations with which cooperation should be developed. In particular it contains dedicated provisions on the support to be provided to the OSCE action to combat the illicit trade in SALW and their ammunition and the destruction of OSCE Participating States' (\u2018Participating States\u2019) surplus stocks.\n(3) On 24 November 2000, the Participating States adopted the OSCE SALW Document that committed them to establishing and implementing effective national controls on transfers of SALW, including export and brokering controls. That Document also emphasises the destabilising effects that the excessive accumulation of SALW and poor stockpile management and security can have on national, regional and international security. It identifies destruction as the preferred method for the disposal of surplus SALW.\n(4) On 26 May 2010, Participating States adopted the OSCE Plan of Action on SALW, where reference is made, inter alia, to the need to establish or reinforce the legal framework of Participating States for lawful brokering activities, to strengthen commitments on the stockpile management and security of SALW, and to strengthen Participating States\u2019 commitment to destroy surplus and illicit SALW, and means to improve their capacity for the destruction of surplus and illicit SALW.\n(5) On 23 June 2003, the Council adopted Common Position 2003/468/CFSP on the control of arms brokering\u00a0(1), requiring Member States to take all necessary measures, including a clear legal framework for lawful brokering activities, to control brokering activities taking place within their territory, and encouraging them to consider controlling brokering activities outside of their territory carried out by brokers of their nationality resident or established in their territory.\n(6) On 8 December 2008, the Council adopted Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment\u00a0(2). Common Position 2008/944/CFSP establishes a set of criteria that guide Member States in the assessment of conventional arms export, re-export and brokering applications. It requires Member States to use their best endeavours to encourage other States, which export military technology or equipment, to apply the criteria of that Common Position,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of promoting peace and security, and effective multilateralism at global and regional levels, the Union shall pursue the following objectives:\n\u2014 enhancing peace and security in the neighbourhood of the Union, by reducing the threat posed by the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW in the OSCE\u00a0region,\n\u2014 supporting effective multilateralism at regional level by encouraging the action of the OSCE to prevent the excessive accumulation of, and the illicit trade in, SALW and their ammunition.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to achieve the objective referred to in paragraph 1, the Union shall undertake the following projects:\n\u2014 organising a regional training workshop for relevant Participating States' officials responsible for brokering controls on SALW,\n\u2014 security upgrades to SALW stockpile storage sites in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan,\n\u2014 the destruction of surplus SALW in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan to prevent their diversion to illegal trade,\n\u2014 the introduction of a SALW inventory management application to improve stockpile, record keeping, and tracing of SALW and conventional ammunition in several Participating States.\nA detailed description of these projects is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The technical implementation of the projects referred to in Article 1(2) shall be carried out by two implementing agencies:\n(a) the OSCE Secretariat shall implement:\n\u2014 the regional training workshop for relevant Participating States' officials on brokering controls on SALW,\n\u2014 the security upgrades to stockpile depots of conventional weapons and ammunition in Kyrgyzstan,\n\u2014 the destruction of surplus SALW in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan to prevent their diversion to illegal trade, and\n\u2014 the introduction of SALW inventory software to improve stockpile management, record keeping and tracing of weapons;\n(b) the United Nations Development Programme Office in Belarus (UNDP Belarus Office) shall implement security upgrades to stockpile depots of conventional weapons and ammunition in Belarus.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The OSCE Secretariat and the UNDP Belarus Office shall perform their tasks under the responsibility of the HR.

This Decision also aims at promoting effective multilateralism at regional level by supporting the action of the OSCE to prevent the excessive accumulation of, and the illicit trade in, SALW and their ammunition. Such activities include the destruction of SALW surpluses in the OSCE region, improvement of security and management of weapons stockpiles, development of appropriate tools for record keeping of weapons, and enhancement of conventional arms transfer controls, in particular brokering.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the projects\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organisation of a regional training workshop for relevant Participating States\u2019 officials on brokering controls on SALW\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objective of the project\n\u2014 To raise awareness and improve implementation by Participating States of existing international and regional commitments in the field of SALW brokering controls;\n\u2014 To analyse best practices and lessons learnt from other countries/regions and identify their applicability to participants\u2019 needs.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\n\u2014 Organisation by the OSCE Secretariat of a three-day regional workshop for relevant state officials from up to 15 Participating States.\nRepresentatives of relevant international and regional organisations, and other experts, including experts from the Union, will participate in the event. Up to 70 participants will attend the event.

All activities except those related to upgrades of SALW storage sites in Belarus will be implemented by the OSCE Secretariat. In Belarus, the activities will be implemented by the UNDP Belarus Office because the OSCE does not have an appropriate representation and legal status in Belarus and also because the implementation of this part of the project by the UNDP Belarus Office is more cost-effective in comparison to a Vienna-based project management by the OSCE. The role of the OSCE in the overall project coordination and implementation oversight related to the selection of storage sites and safety and security measures to be implemented, annual work plans, quality control of completed works and the national contribution of the government of Belarus will remain.
