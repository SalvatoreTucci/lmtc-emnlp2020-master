Experience has shown the need to provide for an expiry date for the suspensions listed in Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 to ensure that account is taken of technological and economic changes. This should not exclude the premature termination of certain measures or their continuation beyond this period, if economic reasons are submitted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Commission Communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas\u00a0(2).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(7) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 July 2007, it should enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation, together with the corresponding rates of duty and validity periods, shall be inserted;\n2. the products for which CN and TARIC codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation, together with the corresponding rates of duty and validity periods, shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 25 June 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
