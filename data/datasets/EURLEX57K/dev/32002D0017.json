Furthermore, seed should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the seed in question.\n(6) Any Member State should furthermore be authorised to permit, in its territory, the marketing of seed which satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of provenance, if the marketing of such seed has been authorised in Spain or France under this Decision.\n(7) Commission Decision 2001/765/EC(3) should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2001/765/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. under the columns headed \"Abies alba, kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of Spain and are replaced by \"70\" and \"EC (E/OEP)\";\n2. under the columns headed \"Larix leptolepis, kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of Spain and are replaced by \"15\" and \"CN, JP\";\n3. under the columns headed \"Pinus strobus, kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of Spain and are replaced by \"3\" and \"US\";\n4. under the columns headed \"Picea sitchensis, kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of Spain and are replaced by \"30\" and \"US\";\n5. under the columns headed \"Pseudotsuga taxifolia, kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of Spain and are replaced by \"280\" and \"EC (E/OEP), US (California, Oregon, Washington)\";\n6. under the columns headed \"Larix decidua Mill., Provenance\" in the entry in respect of France, \"CZ (Sudeten), CZ and SK (origin Polish)\" is replaced by \"CZ (Sudeten), SK (Sudeten) and PL (central Poland)\";\n7. under the columns headed \"Quercus pedunculata Ehrh., kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of France and are replaced by \"1500\" and \"EC (F/OEP)\";\n8. under the columns headed \"Quercus sessiliflora Sal., kg, Provenance\" in the entry in respect of France and are replaced by \"5200\" and \"EC (F/OEP)\".", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2326/66.\n(2) OJ L 87, 17.4.1971, p. 14.\n(3) OJ L 288, 1.11.2001, p. 40."}
