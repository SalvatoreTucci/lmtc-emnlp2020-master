In the case of seed of the category ''certified seed\", the percentage by weight of inert matter shall not exceed 0,5. In the case of pelleted seed of both categories, the satisfaction of the relevant condition shall be examined on samples drawn, pursuant to Article 7 (1), from processed seed which has undergone partial decortication (rubbing or grinding) but has not yet been pelleted, without prejudice to the official examination of the minimum analytical purity of the pelleted seed.'\n2.
