On 6 June 2011, the International Grains Council decided to extend the Grains Trade Convention 1995 until 30 June 2013.\n(4) At the 103rd session of the Food Aid Committee on 14 December 2010, its members agreed to begin the formal process of renegotiating the FAC with a series of negotiation sessions.\n(5) As the new Food Assistance Convention, which will succeed the FAC, enters into force only on 1 January 2013, there is a gap of six months between the expiry of the FAC and the entry into force of the new Food Assistance Convention.\n(6) At the 105th session of the Food Aid Committee on 30 November 2011, Parties to the FAC agreed that an overlap with the new Food Assistance Convention should be avoided and that a six-month gap was preferable to an extension of the FAC.\n(7) The European Commission, which represents the European Union in the Food Aid Committee, should therefore be authorised to oppose a consensus in the Food Aid Committee favouring an extension,", "main_body": ["The position of the European Union within the Food Aid Committee shall be to oppose a consensus in the Food Aid Committee, pursuant to Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the Food Aid Committee, favouring an extension of the Food Aid Convention.", "The Commission is hereby authorised to express this position within the Food Aid Committee.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 7 June 2012.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
