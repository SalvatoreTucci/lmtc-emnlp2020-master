This Regulation lays down the special additional detailed rules necessary for implementing the invitation to tender, in particular those relating to the lodging and release of the security to be lodged by operators to ensure compliance with their obligations and, in particular the obligation to process or use the imported product on the Spanish market.\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 1706/98 of 20 July 1998 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 715/90(5), provides in particular for a reduction of 60 % in the duty applicable to grain sorghum up to a quota of 100000 tonnes per calendar year and of 50 % in excess of that quota. If that benefit is combined with the reduction provided for under this Regulation, this is likely to disturb the Spanish market for cereals. Such combined benefits should be ruled out for the sake of the satisfactory functioning of the invitation to tender.\n(4) In the light of current market needs in Spain an invitation to tender for the reduction in the duty on imports of sorghum should be opened in the framework of these special arrangements for imports.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1. An invitation to tender is hereby opened for the reduction in the import duty referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on sorghum to be imported into Spain.\n2.
