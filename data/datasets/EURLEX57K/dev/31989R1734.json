Quantities shall be charged against the ceilings as and when products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation, accompanied by a movement certificate.\nProducts may be charged against a ceiling only if the movement certificate is submitted before the date on which the collection of customs duties is re-established.\nThe extent to which a ceiling is used up shall be determined at Community level on the basis of the imports charged against it, in the manner specified in the preceding subparagraphs.\nMember States shall inform the Commission, at the intervals and within the time limits specified in paragraph 4, of imports effected in accordance with the above procedures.\n3. As soon as a ceiling has been reached, the Commission may adopt a regulation re-establishing, until the end of its period of validity, the customs duties applicable to third countries.\n4. Member States shall send the Commission statements of the quantities charged for the preceding month no later than the 15th day of each month.
