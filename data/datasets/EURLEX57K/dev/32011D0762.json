In that report it came to the conclusion that yeast beta-glucans were acceptable as a novel food ingredient provided that the product specifications and intended use levels are maintained and that the range of foodstuffs is limited to those presented in the application dossier.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 18 January 2010.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) Therefore, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 2 July 2010.\n(6) On 8 April 2011, EFSA in the \u2018Scientific Opinion on the safety of \u201cYeast beta-glucans\u201d as a novel food ingredient\u2019\u00a0(2) came to the conclusion that yeast beta-glucans were safe under the proposed conditions of use. EFSA opinion did not address in its opinion the safety for children below 1\u00bd years.\n(7) On the basis of the EFSA scientific assessment and taking into account Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements\u00a0(3), Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods\u00a0(4), Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses\u00a0(5), Commission Directive 1999/21/EC of 25 March 1999 on dietary foods for special medical purposes\u00a0(6), Commission Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children\u00a0(7), it is established that yeast beta-glucans comply with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) beta-glucans as specified in Annex I may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient for the uses defined and at the maximum levels established in Annex II, and without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 and Directive 2009/39/EC.", "The designation of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) beta-glucans authorised by this Decision for the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) beta-glucans\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Biothera Incorporated, 3388 Mike Collins Drive, Eagan, Minnesota, USA, 55121."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(5):2137 [22 pp.].\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p. 51.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 26.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 124, 20.5.2009, p. 21.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 29.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 339, 6.12.2006, p. 16.\nANNEX I\nSPECIFICATIONS OF YEAST (SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE) BETA-GLUCANS\nDescription\nBeta-glucans are complex, high molecular mass (100\u2013200 kDa) polysaccharides, found in the cell wall of many yeasts and cereals. The chemical name for \u2018yeast beta-glucans\u2019 is (1-3), (1-6)-\u00df-D-glucans.\nThis novel food is available both in an insoluble and soluble form, isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The insoluble products contain at least 70\u00a0% carbohydrate in the form of beta-glucans; the soluble product contains at least 75\u00a0% beta-glucans.\nThe tertiary structure of the glucan cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of chains of \u00df-1,3-linked glucose residues, branched by \u00df-1,6-linkages, forming a backbone to which are linked chitin via \u00df-1,4- bonds, \u00df-1,6-glucans and some mannoproteins.\nChemical characteristics yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) beta-glucans\nSoluble form Insoluble form\nTotal carbohydrate More than 75\u00a0% More than 70\u00a0%\nBeta-glucans (1,3/1,6) More than 75\u00a0% More than 70\u00a0%\nAsh less than 4\u00a0% Less than 5\u00a0%\nMoisture Less than 8\u00a0% Less than 8\u00a0%\nProtein less than 3,5\u00a0% Less than 10\u00a0%\nFat Less than 10\u00a0% Less than 20\u00a0%\nANNEX II\nFood category Use level\nFood supplements, as defined in Directive 2002/46/EC 375\u00a0mg\nFoods for particular nutritional uses (Parnuts), as defined in Directive 2009/39/EC excluding infant and follow on formula 600\u00a0mg\nBeverages based on fruit juices 130\u00a0mg/100\u00a0ml\nFruit-flavoured drinks 80\u00a0mg/100\u00a0ml\nOther beverages 80\u00a0mg/100\u00a0ml (RTD)\nCereal bars 600\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nCookie-type biscuits 670\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nCracker-type biscuits 20\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nBreakfast cereals 670\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nWholegrain and high fibre instant hot breakfast cereals 150\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nProducts based on yoghurt, fresh cheese and other dairy desserts 160\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nSoups and soup mixes 90\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g (RTE)\nChocolate and confectionery 400\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nProtein bars and powders 600\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nAbbreviations: RTD = ready to drink; RTE = ready to eat."}
