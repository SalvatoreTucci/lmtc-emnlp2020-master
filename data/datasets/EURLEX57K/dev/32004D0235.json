General rules\nThe flock of origin must be isolated for 15 days.\nThe microbiological test must be carried out during the 10 days before forwarding of the consignment.\nThe microbiological test must include the following invasive serotypes:\n- Salmonella gallinarum,\n- Salmonella pullorum,\n- Salmonella enteritidis,\n- Salmonella berta,\n- Salmonella typhimurium,\n- Salmonella thompson,\n- Salmonella infantis.\n2. Sampling method\nComposite faeces samples, each sample being composed of separate samples of fresh faeces, each weighing at least one gram, must be taken randomly at a certain number of points in the building in which the birds are being kept or, when the birds have free access to more than one building on a holding, taken in each group of buildings on the holding in which the birds are kept.\n3. Number of samples to be taken\nThe number of samples must make it possible to detect with 95 % reliability a 5 % presence of salmonella.\n4. Microbiological methods for examination of the samples\n- Microbiological testing of the samples for salmonella should be carried out to the latest edition of the standard of the International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 6579, or by the latest edition of the method described by the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis (NMKL method No 71).\n- Where the results of analysis are contested between Member States the latest edition of the standard of the International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 6579 should be regarded as the reference method.\nANNEX II\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004072EN.008902.TIF\">\nANNEX III\nRepealed Decision with its amendment\n>TABLE>\nANNEX IV\nCorrelation table\n>TABLE>"}
