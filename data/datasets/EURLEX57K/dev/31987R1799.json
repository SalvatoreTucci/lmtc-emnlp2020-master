The annual quantities referred to in Article 1 shall be reduced, according to procedures to be determined, by any quantities of maize gluten, brewers' grains and citrus pulp imported into Spain from third countries.

The amount of the reduction shall be fixed, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, at a level enabling disturbance of the Spanish market to be avoided. The reduction can also be fixed by a tender procedure.\nThe reduction can be differentiated for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain under Regulation (EEC) No 486/85.\n3. The reduction shall be applied to imports of maize and sorghum effected into Spain on the basis of a licence valid only in that Member State.", "1. With a view to effecting the imports referred to in Article 1, it may be decided, under the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, that the Spanish intervention agency shall purchase directly on the world market quantities of maize and sorghum to be determined, and shall place them under customs warehousing procedure as provided for in Directive 69/74/EEC (3).\n2.
