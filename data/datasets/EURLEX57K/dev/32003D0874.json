Description\nUnder the Intergovernmental Agreement of September 2000 between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, each side will dispose of 34 tonnes of weapon-grade plutonium. Both sides have declared their intention to convert this plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) and to load it in existing reactors.\nIt is proposed that, as done since the adoption in 1999 of the Joint Action establishing a European Union cooperation programme for non-proliferation and disarmament in the Russian Federation, the EU continues to support two types of activities which are placed on the critical path of this programme in Russia:\n- safety regulations: regulatory documents developed by the Russian nuclear safety authority (Gosatomnadzor, abridged GAN) to cover the use of ex-weapons plutonium in Russian reactors,\n- MOX demonstration: studies and experiments for MOX fuel demonstration and licensing which are part of a programme also called the 3-LTA programme (for lead test assemblies).\n1.1. Safety regulations\nIn the Russian Federation, it is the role of the independent Russian Nuclear Safety Authority, the Gosatomnadzor (GAN), to set their requirements and to verify that they are met, before the licence can be issued to allow the start of the operations.\nUnder the Joint Action EUR 500000 (Joint Action 1999/878/CFSP) and EUR 1300000 (Council Decision 2001/493/CFSP) have already been allocated to support the start of the development by the GAN of first priority documents needed for the activities of plutonium disposition. The project was implemented under the French-German-Russian Agreement of 1998, by the CEA (Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique), who passed contracts with the GAN and its advisers (IBRAE) to draft such regulatory documents, and also with experienced EU safety experts (grouped under Risk-Audit) for reviewing these documents.\nThere was a basic agreement between the European Commission and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the United States Department of Energy (DoE) to share the financial support of the GAN activities in such tasks.\nBy mid 2003, 12 regulatory documents, from a total of 16, had been drafted and six of them reviewed. The second, improved version of three documents was ready for final review prior to official publication.\nThe present project covers the financing of three further documents written by the GAN and its advisers, and the review of Russian work by EU safety experts. It will be implemented on the basis of a new French-Russian Agreement. This will be done again in close cooperation with the American NNSA.\nThe three documents planned to be developed by the GAN and its technical advisers will cover the use of ex-weapons plutonium in nuclear reactors in Russia as follows:\n- one further regulatory document on fire safety in nuclear fuel cycle facilities,\n- review of design documentation on construction of a fuel fabrication facility at NIIAR site for the three lead test assemblies to be loaded in a VVER-1000 reactor; certification of the related equipment,\n- review of VNIINM design documentation on process modernisation for testing MOX fuel fabrication process using Russian materials, and certification of the related equipment.\nThe GAN expert reviews prepare the licensing of these activities, which are part of the MOX demonstration programme. In addition to reviewing the three GAN documents quoted, the EU safety experts will also review, in parallel to their US counterparts, the general safety regulations for nuclear fuel cycle facilities, a document under revision at GAN.\n1.2. MOX Demonstration\nUnder the Joint Action, EUR 1300000 and EUR 1500000 have already been allocated to support the start of this development by the Joint Action 1999/878/CFSP and Council Decision 2001/493/CFSP, respectively. The basis is mainly given by an overall programme for MOX demonstration elaborated in 2000 by the Bochvar Institute, approved by Minatom and accepted by GAN. This programme is made of a sequence of many steps leading finally to the loading of three MOX fuel assemblies (lead test assemblies, LTA) into a VVER-1000 reactor at Balakovo. It is thus also referred to as the 3-LTA programme.\nThe project has been implemented under the French-German-Russian Agreement of 1998, by the CEA (Commissariat \u00e0 l'energie atomique), who passed direct contracts with the Russian institutes designated by the Minatom. By mid 2003, 12 contracts, from a total of 15, covering as many steps of the programme, were being executed at five different institutes of Minatom. The present project covers the financing of four further steps of the MOX demonstration programme (3-LTA programme).\nThe safe, secure and technologically sound implementation of the disposition of the ex-weapons plutonium in Russia is a priority issue. This project is necessary in this perspective, as it is placed on the critical path. It will be implemented on the basis of a new French-Russian Agreement. The choice of the steps selected is done in common with the French and Russian partners, and it will also be communicated to the US DoE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).\nThe identified further steps in the 3-LTA programme cover:\n- modernisation of a processing line for fabrication of MOX ampoules (short rods),\n- development of a post-irradiation programme in test reactors,\n- fuel performance codes updating for ampoules and MOX fuel rod design,\n- modernisation and adaptation of the VVER plant equipment to allow MOX loading.\nIt is worth noting that in 2002 Minatom designated TVEL as integrator for all MOX fuel activities in the programme, to coordinate the tasks of the various institutes depending of Minatom (like VNIINM Bochvar). On the other hand, RosEnergoAtom is responsible for the operations in its power plants, like the VVERs-1000 at Balakovo. The three first steps mentioned above involve TVEL and Minatom institutes, while the last one involves RosEnergoAtom/Balakovo.\n2. Objectives\nOverall objective: to develop the capacity for the safe disposition of ex-weapons plutonium in the Russian Federation.\nProject purposes\nFor 1.1: on the basis of regulatory documents written by the GAN, to license some steps of the new fuel cycle needed, implying the use of MOX fuel.\nFor 1.2: to perform studies and experiments allowing the use of MOX fuel, and the loading of three lead test assemblies in a VVER-1000 reactor at Balakovo.\nProject results\nFor 1.1: expert reviews produced by the GAN and commented by EU safety experts; certificates from pre-licensing of some steps of the fuel cycle.\nFor 1.2: output of the different steps described above (reports, installed equipment).\n3. Duration\nThe expected duration of the implementation is two years.\nAn evaluation of the work is proposed six months after signature of the first contracts.\n4. Beneficiaries\nFor 1.1: the GAN is the Russian entity benefiting from the outcome of the project.\nFor 1.2: the Minatom is the Russian entity benefiting from the outcome of the project.\nBoth GAN and Minatom will nominate from their organisations high ranking official contact persons for the project, having sufficient capacity and responsibility for ensuring an efficient cooperation with the Member State entity entrusted with implementation of the projects.\n5. Member State entity to be entrusted with the implementation of the projects\nFor 1.1 and 1.2 alike:\n- Member State: France, represented by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\n- Implementing Agency: Commissariat de l'\u00e9nergie atomique (CEA).\n6. Third party participants\nFor the purpose of implementation of the tasks of the projects, the CEA may establish:\n- for 1.1: direct contracts with the GAN/advisers (still to be designated) staff for the work to be done in Russia and with the experienced EU safety experts of Risk-Audit for the review work,\n- for 1.2: direct contracts with the Russian institutes designated by Minatom to do the work in Russia.\nThe CEA, assisted by experts, will supervise the execution of the Russian tasks and will be responsible to ensure full coherence with activities financed by other bodies, in particular under US-RF bilateral programmes.\nContacts will be established with US DoE (NNSA) representatives to ensure that this project be complementary to US activities.\n7. Estimated required means\n7.1. Safety Regulations\nAbout 70 % of the amount is covering Russian expenses, which are primarily labour costs, plus some travel and equipment costs. The remaining about 30 % are foreseen for the nuclear safety experts reviewing GAN's work.\nThe rates will be based on the estimates given in the following GAN document:\n\"List of the federal standards and rules and other regulations in the field of nuclear energy use to be developed within the framework of the project on weapon-grade plutonium disposition\",\nof April 2001.\n7.2.
