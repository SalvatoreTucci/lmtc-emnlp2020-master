These negotiations led to the adoption of a text of a draft convention prepared by the Working Party, which was confirmed by the Council at its meeting on 27 and\u00a028\u00a0May 1999.\n(3) Subsequent negotiations within the Council on the basis of this text led to the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a044/2001 of 22\u00a0December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\u00a0(4), which modernised the rules of the Brussels Convention and made the system of recognition and enforcement swifter and more efficient.\n(4) In the light of the parallelism between the Brussels and the Lugano Convention regimes on jurisdiction and on recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the rules of the Lugano Convention should be aligned with the rules of Regulation (EC) No\u00a044/2001 in order to achieve the same level of circulation of judgments between the EU Member States and the EFTA States concerned.\n(5) In accordance with the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the application of measures pursuant to Title\u00a0IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In order for the rules of the Lugano Convention to apply to Denmark, Denmark should therefore participate as a Contracting Party to a new convention covering the same subject matter.\n(6) By Decision of 27\u00a0September 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate with a view to the adoption of a new Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.\n(7) The Commission negotiated such a convention, on behalf of the Community, with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Denmark. This Convention was signed, on behalf of the Community, on 30\u00a0October 2007 in accordance with Council Decision 2007/712/EC\u00a0(5), subject to its conclusion at a later date.\n(8) At the time of the adoption of Decision 2007/712/EC the Council agreed to examine in the framework of the discussions on the conclusion of the new Lugano Convention the possibility of making a declaration in accordance with Article\u00a0II(2) of Protocol 1 to the Convention. The Community should make such a declaration at the time of conclusion of the Convention.\n(9) During the negotiations of the Convention the Community committed itself to making a declaration, at the time of ratification of the Convention, to the effect that when amending Regulation (EC) No\u00a044/2001 the Community would clarify the scope of Article\u00a022(4) of the said Regulation with a view to taking into account the relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities with respect to proceedings concerned with the registration or validity of intellectual property rights, thereby ensuring its parallelism with Article\u00a022(4) of the Convention. In this context, regard should be had to the results of the evaluation of the application of Regulation (EC) No\u00a044/2001.\n(10) In accordance with Article\u00a03 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(11) In accordance with Articles\u00a01 and\u00a02 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(12) The Convention should now be concluded,", "main_body": ["The conclusion of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, which will replace the Lugano Convention of 16\u00a0September 1988, is hereby approved on behalf of the Community.\nWhen depositing its instrument of ratification, the Community shall make the declarations set out in Annexes\u00a0I and\u00a0II to this Decision.\nThe text of the Convention is attached to this Decision.", "The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to deposit on behalf of the Community the instrument of ratification in accordance with Article\u00a069(2) of the Convention."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27\u00a0November 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
