revised Community eco-label award scheme\u00a0(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,\nAfter consulting the European Union Eco-labelling Board,\nWhereas:\n(1) Commission Decision 2002/747/EC of 9 September 2002 establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to light bulbs and amending Decision 1999/568/EC\u00a0(2) expires

amending Decision 1999/427/EC\u00a0(3) expires on 31 December 2008.\n(3) Commission Decision 2005/342/EC of 23 March 2005 establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community

the related assessment and verification requirements for the award of the Community eco-label to lubricants\u00a0(6) expires on 31 May 2009.\n(6) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 a timely review has been carried out of the ecological criteria, as well as of the related assessment and verification requirements, established by those Decisions.\n(7) Given the different stages of the revision process for these Decisions it is appropriate to prolong the period of validity of the ecological criteria and the requirements for Decisions 2003/31/EC, 2005/342/EC and 2005/344/EC for a period of 24 months, and Decision 2002/747/EC and Decision 2005/360/EC for a period of 14 months.\n(8) Since the review obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 concerns only the ecological criteria and assessment and verification requirements, it is appropriate that Decisions 2002/747/EC, 2003/31/EC, 2005/342/EC, 2005/344/EC and 2005/360/EC remain in effect.\n(9) Decisions 2002/747/EC,
