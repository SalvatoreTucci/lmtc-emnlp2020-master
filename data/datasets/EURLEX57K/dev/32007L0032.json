It consists of checking that the subsystem is in conformity with the provisions of Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC and with the other applicable regulatory provisions and that it can be placed into service, in particular by checking the interfaces with the other subsystems in operational conditions.\n(5) However, there are tests which the manufacturer can carry out on the isolated interoperability constituent (IC) or subsystem, independently of the final environment in which the IC or subsystem will be installed and will be exploited. These \u2018stand alone\u2019 tests, useful and final, are independent of the rail network on which the product will be put into service.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to provide in Annex VI to both Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC the possibility for the manufacturer to apply for first step (design or production phase) assessments, which will lead to Intermediate Statements of Verification (ISV) issued by the notified body. On the basis of those ISV, the main contractor or the manufacturer will be able to draw up an \u2018EC declaration of intermediate IC or subsystem conformity\u2019 for the relevant phase.\n(7) Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 21 of Council Directive 96/48/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex VI to Directive 96/48/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "Annex VI to Directive 2001/16/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed to comply with this Directive before 2 December 2007.

Directive as last amended by Directive 2004/50/EC.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX VI\nVERIFICATION PROCEDURE FOR SUBSYSTEMS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INTRODUCTION\n\u201cEC\u201d verification is the procedure whereby a notified body checks and certifies that a subsystem:\n\u2014 complies with the Directive\n\u2014 complies with the other regulations deriving from the Treaty, and may be put into operation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STAGES\nThe subsystem is checked at each of the following stages:\n\u2014 overall design,\n\u2014 production: construction of subsystem, including, for example civil-engineering activities, manufacturing, constituent assembly, overall adjustment,\n\u2014 final testing of the subsystem.\nFor the design phase (including the type tests) and for the production phase the main contractor (or the manufacturer) or its authorised representative established within the Community may apply for an assessment as a first step.\nIn this case, this (these) assessment(s) lead to intermediate statement verification(s) (ISV) issued by the Notified Body chosen by the main contractor (or the manufacturer). This one in turn draws up an \u201cEC declaration of intermediate subsystem conformity\u201d for the relevant phase(s).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CERTIFICATE\nThe Notified Body responsible for the \u201cEC\u201d verification draws up the certificate of verification intended for the contracting entity or its authorised representative established within the Community, which in turn draws up the \u201cEC\u201d declaration of verification intended for the supervisory authority in the Member State in which the subsystem is located and/or operates.\nThe Notified Body responsible for \u201cEC\u201d verification assesses the design and production of the subsystem.\nIf available, the Notified Body takes into account the \u201cIntermediate Statements of Verification\u201d (ISV(s)), and, in order to issue the \u201cEC\u201d certificate of verification, it:\n\u2014 Checks that the subsystem:\n\u2014 is covered by relevant design and production ISVs delivered to the main contractor (or the manufacturer) if it has asked the Notified Body for these two phases,\n\u2014 or corresponds as produced to all aspects covered by the design ISV delivered to the main contractor (or the manufacturer) if it has asked the Notified Body only for the design phase,\n\u2014 Verifies that they cover correctly the requirement of the TSI and assesses the design and production elements that are not covered by the design and/or production ISV(s) delivered to the main contractor (or the manufacturer).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TECHNICAL FILE\nThe technical file accompanying the declaration of verification must be made up as follows:\n\u2014 for the infrastructure: engineering-structure plans, approval records for excavations and reinforcement, testing and inspection reports on concrete, etc.,\n\u2014 for the other subsystems: general and detailed drawings in line with execution, electrical and hydraulic diagrams, control-circuit diagrams, description of data-processing and automatic systems, operating and maintenance manuals, etc.,\n\u2014 list of interoperability constituents, as referred to in Article 3, incorporated into the subsystem,\n\u2014 copies of the \u201cEC\u201d declarations of conformity or suitability for use with which the above mentioned constituents must be provided in accordance with Article 13 of the Directive accompanied, where appropriate, by the corresponding calculation notes and a copy of the records of the tests and examinations carried out by the notified bodies on the basis of the common technical specifications,\n\u2014 if available, the intermediate statement(s) of verification (ISV) and, in such a case, the \u201cEC\u201d declaration(s) of intermediate subsystem conformity, that accompany the \u201cEC\u201d certificate of verification, including the result of verification by the Notified Body of their validity,\n\u2014 certificate from the Notified Body responsible for \u201cEC\u201d verification, accompanied by corresponding calculation notes and countersigned by itself, stating that the project complies with this Directive and mentioning any reservations recorded during performance of the activities and not withdrawn; the certificate should also be accompanied by the inspection and audit reports drawn up by the same body in connection with its task, as specified in sections 5.3 and 5.4.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MONITORING\n5.1. The aim of \u201cEC\u201d monitoring is to ensure that the obligations deriving from the technical file have been met during production of the subsystem.\n5.2. The Notified Body responsible for checking production must have permanent access to building sites, production workshops, storage areas and, where appropriate, prefabrication or testing facilities and, more generally, to all premises which it considers necessary for its task. The contracting entity or its authorised representative within the Community must send it or have sent to it all the documents needed for that purpose and, in particular, the implementation plans and technical documentation concerning the subsystem.\n5.3. The Notified Body responsible for checking implementation must periodically carry out audits in order to confirm compliance with the Directive. It must provide those responsible for implementation with an audit report. It may require to be present at certain stages of the building operations.\n5.4. In addition, the Notified Body may pay unexpected visits to the worksite or to the production workshops. At the time of such visits the Notified Body may conduct complete or partial audits. It must provide those responsible for implementation with an inspection report and, if appropriate, an audit report.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBMISSION\nThe complete file referred to in paragraph 4 must be lodged with the contracting entity or its authorised agent established within the Community in support of the certificate of verification issued by the Notified Body responsible for verification of the subsystem in working order. The file must be attached to the \u201cEC\u201d declaration of verification which the contracting entity sends to the supervisory authority in the Member State concerned.\nA copy of the file must be kept by the contracting entity throughout the service life of the subsystem. It must be sent to any other Member States which so request.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PUBLICATION\nEach Notified Body must periodically publish relevant information concerning:\n\u2014 requests for \u201cEC\u201d verification received;\n\u2014 intermediate statements of verification (ISVs) issued or refused;\n\u2014 certificates of verification issued or refused.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LANGUAGE\nThe files and correspondence relating to the \u201cEC\u201d verification procedures must be written in an official language of the Member State in which the contracting entity or its authorised representative within the Community is established or in a language accepted by the entity.\u2019"}
