Article 24 provides that the primary requirements for the tendering security are fulfilled by taking over of the butter within the time limit laid down in Article 24f(2). Article 24f(3) refers to the removal of butter in connection with the forfeiture of the security.\n(2) The provisions concerning the release or forfeiture of the security have to be clarified in the light of the experience gained. In particular it needs to be made clear that the security should not be forfeited in cases where the tender amount has been paid. Furthermore, provision should be made for the retroactive application of such rule in order to, in cases of doubt, allow operators to benefit from revised rules.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Milk and milk Products Management Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
