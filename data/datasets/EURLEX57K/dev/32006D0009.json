Therefore for a transitional period until 31 December 2006 and pending a Commission mission to these countries, transit through these countries of consignments of live animals referred to in Decision 79/542/EEC for direct slaughter may be allowed coming from the acceding countries of Bulgaria and Romania and destined to a Member State. This transitional period should apply only for Bulgaria and Romania in view of their intended accession.\n(4) In order to ensure the health status of the individual consignments additional conditions such as sealing of the lorries and stamping of the certificate must be laid down.\n(5) Part 1 of Annex I to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex I to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 12 January 2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 321, as corrected by OJ L 226, 25.6.2004, p. 128.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 14.6.1979, p. 15.
