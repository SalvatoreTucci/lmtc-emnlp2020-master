Article 3a (1) shall be replaced by the following:\n\"1. Each year, when the prices referred to in Article 3 (1) are fixed, the Council shall, under the same procedure, fix a guarantee threshold:      - for durum wheat,\n- for the other cereals.\nShould actual average production over the three most recent preceding marketing years exceed the guarantee threshold fixed for the year in question, the common single intervention price for common wheat, rye, barley, maize and sorghum, the reference price for common wheat and the single intervention price for durum wheat shall be reduced by 1 % for the following marketing year for:      - each 50 000 tonnes in excess, up to a maximum of 5 % in the case of durum wheat,\n- each million tonnes in excess, up to a maximum of 5 % in the case of the other cereals.\nIf, however, imports by the Community of the products listed in Annex D exceed 15 million tonnes in the marketing year preceding the fixing of the guarantee threshold, the difference between the volume of these imports and 15 million tonnes shall be added to the guarantee threshold fixed for cereals other than durum wheat.\"\n5.

In respect of common wheat, durum wheat, barley, maize, rye and sorghum, a threshold price shall be fixed for the Community in such a way that the selling price for the imported product on the Duisburg market shall be the same as the target price, differences in quality being taken into account.

For a standard quality of each of the products listed in Article 1 (a) but not mentioned in paragraph 1 above, except the products falling within subheading 10.07 D I of the Common Customs Tariff, a threshold price shall be fixed for the Community in such a way that the price for the cereals mentioned in paragraph 1 which are in competition with those products reaches the target price on the Duisburg market.\"\n7.
