(1)OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 13. (2)See page 12 of this Official Journal.\n3. Such authorization:    (a) shall not be granted until the United Kingdom has forwarded to the Commission documents proving that the requirements referred to in Article 2 have been satisfied;\n(b) shall be maintained only so long as the conditions referred to in Article 25 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 and Articles 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 of this Regulation continue to be fulfilled.", "1. In order to establish the degree of representativeness referred to in Article 25 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, each MMB shall organize a poll under the supervision of the competent United Kingdom authority.\n2. The poll, which shall be secret, shall be on the question whether the voter is in agreement with maintaining the MMB carrying on the activities and exercising the rights resulting from this Regulation.\n3. All the milk producers established in the region of the MMB concerned, including the producer retailers referred to in Article 8 but excluding producers who, during the 12 months preceding the poll have not sold their milk unprocessed, shall be invited to take part in the poll.\n4. Each voter shall have a number of votes as follows:    (a) one vote by virtue of being an individual producer (producer vote),\n(b) a number of other votes calculated by dividing by 10 the total number of milk cows the voter possesses on a date which shall be determined by the competent United Kingdom authority and which shall fall within a period of six months preceding the poll, with any remainder counting for one vote (production vote).\n5.

However, no request for a new poll shall be accepted before the expiry of a period of five years following the earlier poll.\n3. The United Kingdom shall immediately inform the Commission of:    - any valid request for a new poll,\n- the results of that poll.\nIf, under Article 2 (5), the result of the poll does not confirm the degree of representativeness of an MMB as referred to in Article 25 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, the Commission shall withdraw the authorization for the MMB in question and shall, where necessary, adopt provisional measures to take account of the new situation.", "1. For the purpose of examining whether the authorization referred to in Article 1 (2) should be maintained, the values referred to in Article 25 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 shall be established on the basis of the three year average of the quantities concerned.\n2.

In accordance with rules to be laid down, the United Kingdom shall periodically inform the Commission of trends in human consumption of whole milk and of fresh products, as referred to in paragraph 2, in relation to milk production in the United Kingdom.\n4. Where it is established that the conditions referred to in Article 25 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 are no longer being satisfied and that this situation is likely to continue, the Commission shall examine the reasons for it and, if appropriate, shall make recommendations to the United Kingdom taking account of trends in its national milk sector. Should it prove impossible to redress the situation, the Commission shall withdraw the authorization granted to the United Kingdom.", "The authorization referred to in Article 1 (2) shall contain special conditions to ensure compliance with the following provisions:    1. Any operations of the MMBs in the processing of milk for direct human consumption and the manufacture of milk products shall be subject to a separate system of financial management and administration with a view to placing their processing undertakings on an equal footing with other independent undertakings, particularly as regards supplies, prices charged and credit terms ; MMBs may grant their undertakings loans or other financial transfers only on prevailing market terms.\n2. The profits made by MMBs shall be limited to the absolute minimum necessary to enable it to carry out its statutory functions, with the exception of the activities referred to in paragraph 1, and the relevant funds may be used for this purpose only.\n3. MMB contributions from producers shall:      (a) be authorized only in so far as is necessary for the performance of their statutory functions;\n(b) be proportional to the services rendered in the case of contributions from producer retailers who have sent the MMB the declaration referred to in Article 8 (2) (c).", "1.

The authorization granted to the United Kingdom may be provisional in order to enable the United Kingdom and the MMBs to adapt, within a period to be determined, to the provisions of this Regulation.\nTITLE II Conditions governing the exercise of special rights", "1. The rights referred to in Article 25 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 shall not apply to the quantities of milk which the producer withholds from sale to the MMB either by agreement with that organization or with a view to:    (a) marketing, in either unprocessed or processed form, in another Member State or in a third country, or\n(b) conversion into butter or skimmed-milk powder to be sold to the intervention agency, where it is established that the price paid to the producer by the MMB has fallen, over a period to be determined, below the level which would have resulted from the intervention prices applicable during the same period, taking account of the market situation.\n2. Producers may form groups and/or resort to intermediaries to carry out the operations referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (b).\n3. The rules for implementing this Article shall specify in particular the supervision measures to be introduced.", "1. The rights referred to in Article 25 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 shall not apply to:    (a) quantities of milk produced by a producer retailer as defined in paragraph 2;\n(b) quantities of milk sold to a producer retailer by other producers within the limits referred to in paragraph 3 (b).\n2. A producer retailer within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be an individual producer:    (a) whose total production has not exceeded an average annual quantity of 100 000 kilograms over a period of three calendar years preceding the date of lodging of the declaration referred to in (c);\n(b) who sells the milk of his cows kept on his holding directly to the final consumer in the form of liquid milk, and\n(c) who has declared to the MMB concerned that he wishes to be exempted from all obligations and to forgo all rights to sell to the MMB for a period of at least five years.\n3. The producer retailer may, however:    (a) sell up to 25 % of his annual production to buyers other than the final consumer;\n(b) sell to the final consumer, in the form of liquid milk, a quantity of milk bought from other producers which shall not exceed 25 % of his own annual production.", "With regard to the selling prices applied by the MMBs to milk sold by them, the following shall apply:    1. Prices shall be identical for all buyers concerned and may be differentiated only:      (a) on the basis of the use intended by the buyer;\n(b) on the basis of other criteria established in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4.\n2. Differentiation on the basis of intended use may not have the effect of causing distortion of competition on the United Kingdom market between milk products from other Member States and local products.\n3. To obviate this risk, no selling price applied by the MMBs for milk which they sell may fall below a price corresponding to the lowest price applied on the United Kingdom market for the milk product concerned imported into the United Kingdom from other Member States.\n4. All selling prices actually applied by an MMB shall, in accordance with the provisions referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, be established on the basis of negotiations at which the MMBs and their milk purchasers are represented on an equal footing.\n5. The United Kingdom shall:      (a) take the necessary steps to obtain advance information on the selling prices applied by MMBs on the basis of the various uses for which the milk is intended;\n(b) communicate such prices to the Commission prior to their application.\nThe Commission shall communicate the prices concerned to the other Member States and shall embody them in an examination to be undertaken by the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products, in accordance with Article 31 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68.\nTITLE III Final provisions", "0\n1. The United Kingdom shall take the necessary measures for continuing supervision of compliance by the MMBs with Community principles and rules and with the special conditions governing the authorization.\n2. The United Kingdom shall adapt national rules governing the MMBs to bring them into line with Community regulations. This adaptation shall involve inter alia:    (a) abolishing the power of the MMBs to hinder, by means of a licensing system, the free establishment of processing undertakings in the area concerned;\n(b) abolishing the rights of the MMBs to recall to the United Kingdom liquid milk market milk allocated to buyers, if it is intended for export in unprocessed or processed form.", "1\nWhere transitional measures are required to facilitate the transition of the MMBs to the arrangements introduced in this Regulation, they shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68.\nThese measures shall not affect the principles referred to in the first indent of Article 25 (3) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68. They shall not apply beyond a period of four months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation, as regards Article 9, nor beyond a period of one year as regards the other provisions of this Regulation.", "2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 20 June 1978.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
