whereas public buying in and consumption aid have been abolished, the private storage aid scheme has been overhauled and the control mechanisms and priorities have had a change of focus; whereas it is accordingly necessary to introduce transitional measures to ensure smooth passage between the schemes in force before and after 1 November 1998;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3089/78 of 19 December 1978 laying down general rules in respect of aid for the consumption of olive oil (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1582/96 (4), is repealed from 1 November 1998; whereas the rules need to be laid down as regards applying for, checking and granting consumption aid in respect of quantities entitled to such aid before that date;\nWhereas the checks on the quantities eligible for consumption aid before 1 November 1998, laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 of 24 September 1985 laying down implementing rules in respect of the system of consumption aid for olive oil (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 887/96 (6), may continue for a certain period after the abolition of this aid and relate to increasingly smaller quantities and sums; whereas, to redirect olive oil controls towards oil mills, the extent of each check on consumption aid applications should be reduced; whereas the checks on consumption aid can be done to a great extent using the stock records of the approved plants; whereas the securities for imported olive oil can be released from 1 November 1998 once it is demonstrated that the quantity in question did not also benefit from consumption aid;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 94/98 of 14 January 1998 on the storage contracts for olive oil for the 1997/98 marketing year (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 597/98 (8), includes a definition of oil placed on the market which must be adjusted in the light of the abolition of the consumption aid scheme;\nWhereas Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 deletes Article 12 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, with effect from 1 November 1998, relating in particular to the conditions under which olive oil is bought in and the period in which a tender can be submitted; whereas, with a view to clarity, the buying-in arrangements laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3472/85 of 10 December 1985 on the buying in and storage of olive oil by intervention agencies (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2187/98 (10), should apply to olive oils offered for intervention in the period in question;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 of 30 October 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of production aid for olive oil for the 1998/99, 1999/2000 and 2000/01 marketing years (11) provides for several mechanisms to improve the level of information on and checking of olive oil production and its component parts; whereas it is necessary to specify clearly the situation as regards stocks of olive oil from preceding marketing years still held by producers and mills;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 683/85 (12) should be repealed because they are no longer applicable;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["The measures laid down in Articles 9(3), 10 and 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 shall apply to consumption aid applications submitted before 1 November 1998.\nThe deadlines for recognising entitlement to the aid in the case of the applications referred to in the preceding paragraph and laid down in Articles 9(3) and 11(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 are hereby extended by one month if they expire in November or December 1998.", "In the case of quantities of olive oil for which no consumption aid application was submitted before 1 November 1998 aid applications shall be submitted no later than 31 December 1998 and the measures laid down in Article 9(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 shall apply, except for the on-the-spot checks provided for in Article 9(3).", "1.
