In particular, all Syrian Government Ministers should be designated in view of their collective responsibility for the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.\n(7) The restrictive measures should be maintained against former ministers of the Syrian Government since they may still be considered to be associated with the regime and its violent repression against the civilian population.
