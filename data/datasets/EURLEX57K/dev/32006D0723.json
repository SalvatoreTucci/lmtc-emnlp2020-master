The report came to the conclusion that maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter proposed as a food ingredient at a daily intake of 2 g per day would make it possible to supplement vitamin E intake and also concluded that the levels of phytosterol were not sufficient to reduce cholesterolaemia.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 18 February 2002.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was therefore consulted on 30 January 2004.\n(6) On 6 December 2005, EFSA adopted the \u2018Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter as a novel food ingredient\u2019.\n(7) The opinion came to the conclusion that the proposed use level of 2\u00a0g per day of \u2018maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter\u2019 was safe.\n(8) It is recognised that \u2018maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter\u2019 at the intended use level of 2\u00a0g per day is a safe source of Vitamin E. For labelling and presentation Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements\u00a0(2) applies.\n(9) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that \u2018maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter\u2019 complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["\u2018Maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter\u2019, as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient for use in food supplements.", "The maximum amount of \u2018maize-germ oil high in unsaponifiable matter\u2019 present in a portion recommended for daily consumption by the manufacturer shall be 2\u00a0g.", "The designation of the novel food ingredient shall be \u2018maize-germ oil extract\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Laboratoires Expanscience, Si\u00e8ge Social, 10, Avenue de l\u2019Arche, F-92419 Courbevoie Cedex."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.
