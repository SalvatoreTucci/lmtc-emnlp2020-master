In addition, Article 4 of this Directive provides that \u2018The transport of dangerous goods between Member States and third countries shall be authorised in so far as it complies with the requirements of the ADR, RID or ADN, unless otherwise indicated in the Annexes.\u2019 Thus, the Union has exercised its competence in this subject-matter.\n(4) The Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods set up in accordance with Article 13.1(d) of the COTIF Convention, at its 53rd session due to take place on 22 May 2014, is expected to decide upon certain amendments to the RID Annex. These amendments, which concern technical standards or uniform technical prescriptions, have the objective to ensure safe and efficient transport of dangerous goods whilst taking into account scientific and technical progress in the sector and the development of new substances and articles that pose danger during their transport.\n(5) The committee on the transport of dangerous goods established by Article 9 of Directive 2008/68/EC has carried out preliminary discussions on these amendments.\n(6) Most of the proposed amendments are justified and beneficial, and should therefore be supported by the Union. Two proposed amendments need to be further assessed in the light of technical and scientific progress. In particular, the European Railway Agency, in cooperation with the relevant bodies, should continue to work on the identification of a sustainable solution to detect derailments and mitigate their effects, including the future implementation of this solution. Therefore, should the latter amendments be approved at this point, the Union should formulate an objection following the procedure established in Article 35\u00a74 of Title VII of the COTIF Convention,", "main_body": ["Position of the European Union\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The position to be taken by the European Union at the 53rd session of the Committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods in the framework of the Convention concerning international carriage by rail shall be in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minor changes to the documents mentioned in the Annex to this Decision may be agreed by the representatives of the Union in the above-mentioned body without further decision of the Council.", "After its adoption the Decision of the abovementioned body shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "Entry into force\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
