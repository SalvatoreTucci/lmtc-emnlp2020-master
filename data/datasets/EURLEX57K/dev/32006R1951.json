Steps should therefore be taken to extend the use of the terms referred to in Annex X of Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 to types of wood other than oak, provided that the relevant indications are correct and not misleading. To prevent any distortion of competition between producers, appropriate labelling rules should be laid down.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
