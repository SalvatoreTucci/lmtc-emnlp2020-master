The Regulation provides that, prior to determination of the BSE status, transitional measures are to be adopted for a maximum period of two years.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1326/2001 of 29 June 2001(5) provides for transitional measures which are to apply for a maximum period of two years from 1 July 2001.\n(4) Certain problems have been encountered in using the criteria laid down in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 to determine BSE status. The Commission has discussed with Member States possible amendments to those criteria in order to produce a better alignment of BSE status and risk. The outcome of those discussions may be significantly influenced by developments in the BSE Chapter in the International Animal Health Code of the International Office of Epizootics.\n(5) It is necessary to prolong the period of application of the transitional measures to allow those discussions to be concluded.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, the second subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\"In accordance with that procedure, transitional measures shall be adopted for a period ending on 1 July 2005 at the latest, to permit the changeover from the current arrangements to the arrangements established by this Regulation.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 16 June 2003.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nP.
