In addition, that attestation certifies either that there has been no outbreak of HPAI for at least the previous 30 days within a 10\u00a0km radius of that establishment or that the egg products were processed in accordance with one of the treatments set out in that certificate.\n(5) In 2012 several outbreaks of HPAI of the subtype H7N3 were confirmed in the State of Jalisco in Mexico, in an area with a high density of poultry holdings. Mexico applied a stamping-out policy and carried out emergency vaccination against avian influenza to control the outbreaks.\n(6) The latest HPAI outbreak of that epidemic was confirmed at the end of September 2012 and Mexico declared the outbreaks as eradicated in December 2012.\n(7) On 8 January 2013, Mexico notified the Commission of two HPAI outbreaks of the H7N3 subtype in poultry on its territory in the State of Aguascalientes. The disease has also spread to the States of Jalisco and Guanajuato.\n(8) In view of the confirmation of the HPAI outbreaks, the territory of Mexico may no longer be considered as free from that disease.\n(9) The recurrence of HPAI outbreaks raises concerns as to the effectiveness of the measures including vaccination applied in Mexico to control HPAI.\n(10) Imports of egg products processed in accordance with one of the treatments set out in the relevant certificate referred to in column 4 of the table in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, originating in third countries, territories, zones or compartments that are not free from HPAI, are considered to pose a negligible risk for virus introduction into the Union.\n(11) However, given the rapid spread of the disease HPAI and the risk that the HPAI outbreaks may not be detected in time by the Mexican competent authority, imports into or transit through the Union of egg products from Mexico should be temporarily prohibited until satisfactory guarantees can be provided by that country.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0226, 23.8.2008, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for Mexico is replaced by the following:\n\u2018MX-Mexico MX-0 Whole country SPF\nEP  P2 17 May 2013\u2019"}
