This concerns in particular those who played a leading role in the mutiny of 1 April 2010 and the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 12 April 2012 and whose actions continue to be aimed at undermining the rule of law and the primacy of civilian power. These measures include the freezing of funds and economic resources of the natural or legal persons, entities and bodies listed in the Annex to that Decision.\n(2) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, in particular with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States, regulatory action at the level of the Union is necessary in order to implement them.\n(3) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably the right to an effective remedy, the right to a fair trial and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(4) The power to amend the list in Annex I to this Regulation should be exercised by the Council, in view of the specific threat to international peace and security posed by the situation in Guinea-Bissau and in order to ensure consistency with the procedure for amending and reviewing the Annex to Decision 2012/237/CFSP.\n(5) The procedure for amending the list in Annex I to this Regulation should include providing designated natural or legal persons, entities or bodies with the grounds for the listing so as to give them an opportunity to submit observations. Where observations are submitted, or substantial new evidence is presented, the Council should review its decision in the light of those observations and inform the person, entity or body concerned accordingly.\n(6) For the implementation of this Regulation, and in order to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen in accordance with this Regulation should be made public. Any processing of personal data should respect Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(7) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018funds\u2019 means financial assets and benefits of every kind, including but not limited to:\n(i) cash, cheques, claims on money, drafts, money orders and other payment instruments;\n(ii) deposits with financial institutions or other entities, balances on accounts, debts and debt obligations;\n(iii) publicly- and privately-traded securities and debt instruments, including stocks and shares, certificates representing securities, bonds, notes, warrants, debentures and derivatives contracts;\n(iv) interest, dividends or other income on or value accruing from or generated by assets;\n(v) credit, right of set-off, guarantees, performance bonds or other financial commitments;\n(vi) letters of credit, bills of lading, bills of sale;\n(vii) documents evidencing an interest in funds or financial resources;\n(b) \u2018freezing of funds\u2019 means preventing any move, transfer, alteration, use of, access to, or dealing with funds in any way that would result in any change in their volume, amount, location, ownership, possession, character, destination or other change that would enable the funds to be used, including portfolio management;\n(c) \u2018economic resources\u2019 means assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, which are not funds but can be used to obtain funds, goods or services;\n(d) \u2018freezing of economic resources\u2019 means preventing the use of economic resources to obtain funds, goods or services in any way, including, but not limited to, by selling, hiring or mortgaging them;\n(e) \u2018territory of the Union\u2019 means the territories to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in the Treaty.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by natural or legal persons, entities and bodies who, in accordance with Article 2(1) of Decision 2012/237/CFSP, have been identified by the Council as either (i) engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the peace, security or stability of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau or (ii) being associated with such persons, entities or bodies, as listed in Annex I, shall be frozen.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No funds or economic resources shall be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of the natural or legal persons, entities or bodies listed in Annex I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Participation, knowingly and intentionally, in activities the object or effect of which is, directly or indirectly, to circumvent the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be prohibited.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex I shall include the grounds for listing of listed persons, entities and bodies.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex I shall also include, where available, information necessary to identify the natural or legal persons, entities and bodies concerned.
