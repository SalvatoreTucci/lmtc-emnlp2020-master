For Bulgaria and Romania gross national electricity consumption is based on 2001 data.

The possibility of reaching this indicative target is highly dependent upon the total annual rainfall, timing of rainfall during the year and inflow as well as other climatic factors heavily affecting the level of hydropower production and utilization of solar and wind energy. Furthermore, the RES utilization is limited by the relevant environmental and related national legislation corresponding to the respective EU\u00a0legislation.\u2019."}
