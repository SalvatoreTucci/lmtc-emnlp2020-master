The relevant Certification Specifications were however adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) only in December 2013. As a consequence, it will not be possible for operators to equip new aircraft with the new functionalities ADS-B \u2018Out\u2019 and Mode S Enhanced by 8 January 2015. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1207/2011 should therefore be amended, so as to provide the operators concerned with sufficient additional time for this purpose.\n(3) Delays in certification and in availability of required equipment, as well as industrial capacity constraints for equipping aircraft, affect the smooth retrofitting of existing fleet. A number of aircraft, mainly for trans-Atlantic operations, are also to be equipped with ADS-B \u2018Out\u2019 functionality by 1 January 2020 as mandated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The retrofit date for ADS-B \u2018Out\u2019 and Mode S Enhanced should therefore be postponed and brought more closely into line with the deadline for the FAA ADS-B requirements.\n(4) State aircraft operators should benefit from similar postponements in implementation dates as other operators of aircraft. The deadline for retrofitting for state aircraft with the new ADS-B \u2018Out\u2019 and Mode S Enhanced functionalities should therefore also be postponed.\n(5) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1207/2011 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee, established by Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1207/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n(a) aircraft operating flights referred to in Article 2(2) with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued on or after 8 January 2015 are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex II;\n(b) aircraft with a maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5\u00a0700 kg or having a maximum cruising true airspeed capability greater than 250 knots, operating flights referred to in Article 2(2), with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued on or after 8 June 2016 are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having, in addition to the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex II, the capabilities set out in Part B of that Annex;\n(c) fixed wing aircraft with a maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5\u00a0700 kg or having a maximum cruising true airspeed capability greater than 250 knots, operating flights referred to in Article 2(2), with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued on or after 8 June 2016 are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having, in addition to the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex II, the capabilities set out in Part C of that Annex.\u2019\n(b) Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n(a) by 7 December 2017 at the latest, aircraft operating flights referred to in Article 2(2), with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued before 8 January 2015, are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex II;\n(b) by 7 June 2020 at the latest, aircraft with a maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5\u00a0700 kg or having a maximum cruising true airspeed capability greater than 250 knots, operating flights referred to in Article\u00a02(2), with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued before 8 June 2016 are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having, in addition to the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex\u00a0II, the capabilities set out in Part B of that Annex;\n(c) by 7 June 2020 at the latest, fixed wing aircraft with a maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5\u00a0700 kg or having a maximum cruising true airspeed capability greater than 250 knots, operating flights referred to in Article 2(2), with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued before 8 June 2016 are equipped with secondary surveillance radar transponders having, in addition to the capabilities set out in Part A of Annex II, the capabilities set out in Part C of that Annex.\u2019\n(2) In Article 8, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(3) In Article 14, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a096, 31.3.2004, p.\u00a026.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1207/2011 of 22 November 2011 laying down requirements for the performance and the interoperability of surveillance for the single European sky (OJ L\u00a0305, 23.11.2011, p.\u00a035)."}
