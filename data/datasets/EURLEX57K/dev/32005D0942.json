The Commission\u2019s analysis shows that this material offers equivalent guarantees to those applicable to forest reproductive material produced in the Community in accordance with Directive 1999/105/EC.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Member States are authorised to decide in respect of the third countries listed in the Annex, and in respect of the species, categories and types of basic material set out therein whether forest reproductive material produced in those countries affords the same assurances as regards the approval to its basic material and the measures taken for its production with a view to marketing as does forest reproductive material produced within the Community and complying with the provisions of Directive 1999/105/EC.\nForest reproductive material imported from those third countries shall be accompanied by a master certificate or an official certificate issued by the country of origin and records which shall contain details of all consignments to be exported, to be provided by the supplier in the third country.", "Member States shall immediately notify the Commission and other Member States of any decisions taken pursuant to this Decision, and of any withdrawal of such decisions.", "The authorisation provided for in Article 1 shall apply from 1 January 2006 and shall expire 31 December 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 11, 15.1.2000, p. 17.\nANNEX\nCountry of origin Species Category Type of basic material\nBelarus Picea abies Karst.
