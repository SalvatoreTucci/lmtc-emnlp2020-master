The surveillance programme, which included sampling of slaughter groups at the abattoir and voluntary measures in farms, showed some success in reducing the prevalence of Campylobacter in the slaughter groups of broilers.\n(7) The Swedish authorities presented on 31 May 2000, with a view to obtaining financial support from the Community, a multiannual national surveillance programme of Campylobacter in broilers, and a revised programme on 13 October 2000, to estimate the baseline prevalence both in primary production and in the food chain, and to progressively reinforce implementation of hygienic measures in farms with a view to lowering the prevalence at farm level and subsequently along the food chain. The programme started on 1 July 2001.\n(8) The said programme can provide technical and scientific information potentially valuable for the development of Community veterinary legislation.\n(9) In the light of the importance of Campylobacter as a zoonosis, it is useful to provide financial assistance for an appropriate period of time within a maximum of four years, to cover certain costs incurred by Sweden and to collect valuable technical and scientific information. For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year. By Commission Decision 2001/29/EC(3), the Community provided financial assistance for the second semester of the year 2001.\n(10) The Swedish authorities presented on 31 May 2001 a programme for Community financial assistance during 2002, and a revised programme on 26 July 2001 and 19 October 2001. The financial assistance provided for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 shall be up to a maximum of EUR 160000.\n(11) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(12) A financial contribution from the Community shall be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
