More specifically, the fifth indent of Article 13(1) exempts substances which are for exclusive use in other product sectors for which Community notification or approval procedures exist and for which the requirements for data submission are equivalent to those laid down in Directive 67/548/EEC. Therefore, the Commission is required to establish a list of those pieces of Community legislation which contain such notification or approval procedures.
