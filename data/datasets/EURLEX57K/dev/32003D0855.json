That investigation was based on Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 (the \"TPSSM investigation\") and also on Council Regulations (EC) No 519/94 and (EC) No 3285/94 (the general erga omnes safeguard investigation).\n(8) On 8 November 2003, the Commission published Regulation (EC) No 1964/2003(4) imposing provisional safeguard measures against imports of certain prepared or preserved citrus fruits (namely mandarins, etc.) on the basis of its preliminary findings in the general erga omnes safeguard investigation. The general erga omnes safeguard investigation is continuing with a view to establishing whether or not definitive safeguard measures are justified, and, if so, the form and content of such measures. As the provisional measures imposed in the context of the general erga omnes safeguard investigation were considered sufficient to protect the Community industry, no provisional measures were imposed on the basis of the TPSSM investigation.\n(9) The Commission considers it is not in the Community interest to continue with two proceedings which are different in their conditions and their possible outcome.\n(10) Therefore, continuing the investigation with a view to taking a safeguard measure under Council Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 is not appropriate and therefore not necessary. No objection having been raised within the Advisory Committee, the Commission considers that the TPSSM investigation should be terminated without measures,", "main_body": ["The safeguard investigation under Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 initiated by the Commission on 11 July 2003 is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2003.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 65, 8.3.2003, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 89, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 (OJ L 65, 8.3.2003, p. 1).\n(3) OJ L 349, 31.12.1994, p. 53, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2474/2000 (OJ L 286, 11.11.2000, p. 1).\n(4) OJ L 290, 8.11.2003, p. 3."}
