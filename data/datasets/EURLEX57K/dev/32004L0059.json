They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.\n(5) Information on essential uses in the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC has been notified to the Commission for bromopropylate. The information provides an adequate basis for an assessment of the intake by European consumers.\n(6) Authorisations of bromopropylate are to be withdrawn by 31 July 2007 at the latest. Taking into account the time it takes for residues of bromopropylate to leave the food chain it is appropriate that temporary MRLs related to these essential uses be reviewed by 31 December 2008 at the latest.\n(7) The lifetime exposure of consumers to bromopropylate via food products that may contain residues of that pesticide, has been assessed and evaluated. It has been calculated that the MRLs as amended will ensure that the acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.\n(8) The acute exposure of consumers to bromopropylate via each of the food products that may contain residues of this pesticide has been assessed and evaluated. It has been calculated that the MRLs as amended will ensure that the acute reference dose is not exceeded.\n(9) Therefore it is appropriate to amend the maximum levels for residues of bromopropylate.\n(10) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The maximum pesticide residue levels for bromopropylate in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC are replaced by those in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
