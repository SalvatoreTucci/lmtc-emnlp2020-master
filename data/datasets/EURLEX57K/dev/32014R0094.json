That list includes iodine.\n(2) Iodine has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 1, human hygiene biocidal products, product-type 3, veterinary hygiene biocidal products, product-type 4, food and feed area disinfectants, and product-type 22, embalming and taxidermist fluids, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which correspond respectively to product-types 1, 3, 4 and 22 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) The data submitted for the purpose of the evaluation allowed conclusions to be also drawn on polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine.\n(4) Sweden was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with recommendations, to the Commission on 20 April 2011 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(5) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 December 2013, in an assessment report.\n(6) It appears from that report that biocidal products used for product-types 1, 3, 4 and 22 and containing iodine may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC, provided that the conditions specified in the Annex to this Regulation are satisfied.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to approve iodine, including polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine, for use in biocidal products for product-type 1, 3, 4 and 22.\n(8) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(9) The evaluation did not address the incorporation of biocidal products containing iodine in materials and articles intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4). Such materials may require the establishment of specific limits on the migration into food, as referred to in Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. The approval should therefore not cover such use unless the Commission has established such limits or it has been established pursuant to that Regulation that such limits are not necessary.\n(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Iodine, including polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine, shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-types 1, 3, 4 and 22, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (OJ L 338, 13.11.2004, p. 4).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Identification Numbers Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nIodine (including polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine) IUPAC Name: 995\u00a0g/kg of iodine 1 September 2015 31 August 2025 1 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n3 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n4 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1) For products that may lead to residues in food or feed, the need to set new or to amend existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 or Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 shall be verified, and any appropriate risk mitigation measures shall be taken to ensure that the applicable MRLs are not exceeded.\n(2) Products containing iodine shall not be incorporated in materials and articles intended to come into contact with food within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, unless the Commission has established specific limits on the migration of iodine into food or it has been established pursuant to that Regulation that such limits are not necessary.\n22 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not adressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The purity indicated in this column was the minimum degree of purity of the active substance used for the evaluation made in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
