Portugal has taken measures in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC to control the spread of that disease.\n(3) Portugal has carried out a risk assessment and identified that holdings keeping mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) intended for re-stocking supplies of game (mallard ducks), are at an increased risk of infection from avian influenza viruses, in particular by contact with wild birds and that a significant and immediate threat of spread of avian influenza exists.\n(4) Early detection systems and biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of avian influenza to poultry flocks are in place in Portugal in the areas that have been defined by that Member State as high risk areas pursuant to Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk\u00a0(2).\n(5) In relation to trade in poultry intended for re-stocking supplies of game, additional measures have been taken by Portugal pursuant to Commission Decision 2006/605/EC of 6 September 2006 on certain protection measures in relation to intra-Community trade in poultry intended for re-stocking of wild game supplies\u00a0(3).\n(6) Portugal has by letter dated 25 January 2008, submitted an emergency vaccination plan to the Commission for approval and a revised version of that plan was submitted on 31 January 2008.\n(7) According to that emergency vaccination plan, Portugal intends to introduce emergency vaccination on one holding in the region of Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Ribatejo Norte, Vila Nova da Barquinha keeping valuable breeding mallard ducks and using a bivalent vaccine directed against avian influenza virus of subtypes H7 and H5 which is to be applied until 31 July 2008.\n(8) In its scientific opinions on the use of vaccination to control avian influenza issued by the European Food Safety Authority in 2005\u00a0(4) and 2007\u00a0(5), the Animal Health and Welfare Panel stated that emergency and preventive vaccination against avian influenza is a valuable tool to complement the control measures for that disease.\n(9) In addition, the Commission has examined the emergency vaccination plan submitted by Portugal, together with the Portuguese authorities, and after its amendment is satisfied that it conforms with relevant Community legislation. In view of the epidemiological situation as regards low pathogenic avian influenza in Portugal, the type of holding to be vaccinated and the limited scope of the vaccination plan, it is appropriate to approve the emergency vaccination plan submitted by Portugal to supplement the control measures already taken by that Member State.\n(10) For the purposes of the emergency vaccination to be carried out by Portugal, only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(6) or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency\u00a0(7) should be used.\n(11) In addition, surveillance and monitoring in the holding keeping the vaccinated mallard ducks and in unvaccinated poultry holdings, as set out in the emergency vaccination plan, should be carried out.\n(12) It is also appropriate to introduce certain restrictions on the movement of vaccinated mallard ducks, their hatching eggs and mallard ducks derived from vaccinated poultry. Due to the small number of mallard ducks present on the holding where emergency vaccination is to be carried out, as well as for reasons of traceability and logistics, vaccinated birds should not be moved from that holding.\n(13) In order to reduce the economic impact on the holding concerned certain derogations from movement restrictions for mallard ducks derived from vaccinated mallard ducks should be provided for, since such movements do not pose a specific risk for spread of disease and provided that surveillance and monitoring measures are carried out and that the specific animal health requirements for intra-Community trade are complied with.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision lays down certain measures to be applied in Portugal where emergency vaccination of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) intended for re-stocking supplies of game (mallard ducks) is carried out in a holding, which is at particular risk for introduction of avian influenza.
