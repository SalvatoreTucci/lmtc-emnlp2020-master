As a result of problems in applying the cotton production aid scheme in Greece in the first marketing year following the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the information required to assess actual production in Greece is not yet fully available. Until that information becomes available and has been analysed, actual production of unginned cotton in Greece and the resultant reduction in the guide price should therefore not be fixed.\n(4) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1051/2001 stipulates that, if actual production in Spain and Greece exceeds 1031000 tonnes, the guide price referred to in Article 3(1) of that Regulation is to be reduced in each Member State where production exceeds its guaranteed national quantity (GNQ). Such reduction is calculated differently depending on whether the GNQ is exceeded both in Greece and Spain or only in one of those Member States.\n(5) In the 2001/02 marketing year there is an overshoot of the guaranteed national quantity in Spain, as there certainly will be in Greece based on the information already available. Moreover, actual production in Spain is at a level below that of its guaranteed national quantity increased by 113000 tonnes. As a result, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the reduction in the guide price in Spain is 50 % of the rate of overshoot referred to in paragraph 3 of that Article. This reduction is therefore fixed at the level indicated below.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,", "main_body": ["1. For the 2001/02 marketing year, actual production of unginned cotton is fixed at 336984 tonnes for Spain and 612 tonnes for Portugal.\n2.
