The standard supersedes the previous version EN 13525:2005+A1:2007, the reference of which was first published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 6 November 2007\u00a0(3).\n(3) The formal objection is based on the failure of the provisions 4.2.4 Infeed stop control and 4.3.3 Hazards related to infeed components and chipping components of the standard, to sufficiently cover the essential health and safety requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC, since it does not take properly into account the possibility that the operators can be caught up in and pulled towards dangerous moving parts of the machine, without being able to activate the emergency stop function.\n(4) Having examined the standard EN 13525:2005+A2:2009 together with the representatives of the committee established by Article 22 of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Commission concluded that the standard fails to meet the essential health and safety requirements provided for in points 1.3.7 Risks related to moving parts and 1.3.8.2 Moving parts involved in the process of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC, for the reason that the machines designed to comply with those requirements present major risks for operators and third parties, fatal accidents having been already encountered.\n(5) Taking into consideration the need to improve the safety aspects of the standard EN 13525:2005+A2:2009, the reference of that standard should be withdrawn from the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 13525:2005+A2:2009 \u2018Forestry machinery \u2014 Wood chippers \u2014 Safety\u2019 shall be withdrawn from the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0157, 9.6.2006, p.\u00a024.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0316, 14.11.2012, p.\u00a012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0264, 6.11.2007, p.\u00a01."}
