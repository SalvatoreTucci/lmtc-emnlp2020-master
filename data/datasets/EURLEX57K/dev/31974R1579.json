altered during the month unless the variation in the levy on basic products reaches a certain limit to be fixed;\nWhereas, with a view to the implementation of Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No

on the quantities of such products used for calculating the variable component;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 15 (3) of Regulation 120/67/EEC and Article 13 (3) of Regulation No 359/67/EEC, the

by Regulation (EEC) No 1052/68, the levy in force for 100 kg of the basic product exceeds by 0\u00b725 unit of account the average levy, adjusted in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 2 (1) of that Regulation, on the same quantity during the first 25 days of the preceding month, the variable component of the levy on the processed product shall be increased by an amount equal to the ascertained excess, rounded to 0\u00b725 unit of account or to the nearest multiple of 0\u00b725 unit of account, the amount of such excess then being multipled by the coefficient shown in column 4 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1052/68.\nThis increase shall apply on the day following ascertainment of the excess.\nWhere, subsequently during the same month, the levy in force differs by not less than 0\u00b725 unit of account per 100 kg of basic product from the variable component increased as specified above (prior to multiplication by the abovementioned), that variable component shall be increased or reduced by an amount equal to the ascertained difference, rounded to 0\u00b725 unit of account or to the nearest multiple of 0\u00b725 unit of account, the rounded differences being then multiplied by the abovementioned coefficient.\nHowever, the amount of the levy may in no case be reduced below the level fixed on the first day of the month.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the application

of the levy, without prejudice to the possible application of the second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) of Regulation No 120/67/EEC.\nThis adjustment shall be made by increasing or reducing the levy
