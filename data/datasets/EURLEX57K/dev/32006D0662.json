Such information is not at hand and a special survey should therefore be carried out to monitor the prevalence of salmonella in turkeys over a suitable period in order to take account of possible seasonal variations.\n(4) The survey is to provide technical information necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation. Given the importance of collecting comparable data on the prevalence of salmonella in turkeys in the Member States, they should be granted a Community financial contribution for implementing the specific requirements of the survey. It is appropriate to reimburse 100\u00a0% of the costs incurred on the laboratory testing, subject to a ceiling. All other costs such as sampling, travel, administration, etc should not be eligible for any Community financial contribution.\n(5) A financial contribution from the Community should be granted provided that the survey is carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of Community law and subject to compliance with certain other conditions.\n(6) A financial contribution from the Community should be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(7) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of payment applications submitted in national currencies as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro\u00a0(3).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Objective of the survey and general provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A survey shall be carried out to assess the prevalence of Salmonella spp. across the Community in\n\u2014 flocks of fattening turkeys sampled within three weeks of leaving the selected holding for slaughter;\n\u2014 flocks of breeding turkeys within 9 weeks before depopulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results of the survey shall be used to set Community targets as provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The survey shall cover a one-year period commencing on 1 October 2006.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Decision, \u2018competent authority\u2019 shall be the authority or authorities of a Member State as designated under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.", "Sampling frame\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling for the purpose of the survey in flocks of turkeys shall be organised by the Member States and shall be performed from 1 October 2006 on holdings containing at least 500 fattening birds or 250 breeding birds.
