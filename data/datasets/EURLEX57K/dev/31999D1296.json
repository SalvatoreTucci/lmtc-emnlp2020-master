ACTIONS TO IMPROVE INFORMATION ON POLLUTION-RELATED DISEASES\nObjective:\nto contribute towards a better understanding of the role of pollutants in the causation and aggravation of diseases in the Community.\n1. Establishing priorities for the identification of those diseases in which specific pollutants are thought to play a role, inter alia by comparing the prevalence and/or incidence of such diseases with data on environmental factors in the different parts of the Community in order to establish any relationship between them, and by making this information known to the public.\n2. Examining the quality of epidemiological data for these diseases and identifying where data are lacking, with the aim of contributing to improving the existing basis for developing further European cooperation in the epidemiological field and encouraging the continuation of Community research, taking into account work carried out at international level, including any WHO studies.\n3. Reviewing data currently available on the toxicology of pollutants involved in these diseases and identifying gaps in knowledge which it would be important to address, taking into account long-term effects and possible synergies between pollutants.\nII. ACTIONS TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF POLLUTION-RELATED DISEASES\nObjective:\nTo improve the level of knowledge and understanding of the assessment and management of pollution-related health risks.\n1. Contributing to improve the comparability of data used in preventive actions against pollution-related diseases, through exchanges of information.\n2. Supporting the exchange of information aimed at achieving better public understanding of pollution-related health risks.\n3. Promoting actions and exchanges of information on the methods of increasing the level of knowledge of the general public and opinion-formers about pollution-related risks to health, their assessment and management; promoting work on the public perceptions of pollution-related risks to health throughout the Community and and of the impact on pollution and health of the various policies; promoting, initially via professionals, knowledge of behaviour patterns, ways of life and eating habits that could reduce the health risks caused by various types of pollution."}
