Sampling indicated a serious and recurring aflatoxin contamination of peanuts originating in or consigned from Egypt;\n(3) The Scientific Committee for Food has noted that aflatoxins, in particular Aflatoxin B1, are carcinogenic substances and even at low doses, cause cancer of the liver and in addition are genotoxic;\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1525/98(3) amending Regulation (EC) No 194/97 sets maximum levels for certain contaminants and in particular aflatoxins in foodstuffs. These limits have been exceeded to an excessive amount in samples of peanuts originating in or consigned from Egypt. The limits for Aflatoxin B1 in ground nuts which are intended for direct consumption, and those which may be sorted or subject to further processing, are set in this Regulation at two and eight parts per billion (ppb) respectively. Contamination of Aflatoxin B1 at levels as high as 485 ppb have been detected in peanuts from Egypt;\n(5) Egypt is a major exporter of peanuts to the Community and the exposure of the population to peanuts or peanut products contaminated with aflatoxin constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community;\n(6) An examination of conditions of hygiene in Egypt has been undertaken and revealed that improvements in hygiene practices and the traceability of peanuts are required. Commitments have been received from the Egyptian authorities in particular in relation to improvements in production, handling, sorting, processing, packaging and transport practices. It is therefore appropriate to subject peanuts or products derived from peanuts originating in or consigned from Egypt to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health;\n(7) It is necessary that peanuts and products derived from peanuts have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygienic practices. It is necessary to establish the levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving Egypt;\n(8) It is necessary for documentary evidence to be provided by the Egyptian authorities to accompany each consignment of peanuts originating in or consigned from Egypt, relating to the conditions of production, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport and the results of laboratory analysis of the consignment for levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin;\n(9) It is necessary to submit for analyses at the port of entry into the Community in a systematic manner, lots of peanuts originating in or consigned from Egypt in order to determine the levels of contamination of peanuts of Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin,", "main_body": ["1.
