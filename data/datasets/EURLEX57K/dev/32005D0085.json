Directive 93/43/EEC will be repealed as from 1 January 2006 by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\u00a0(4). This Regulation does no longer contain the legal basis for a safeguard measure.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides that where it is evident that food or feed originating in the Community or imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health and the environment, measures are to be adopted.\n(4) Pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran have been found, in many cases, to be contaminated with excessive levels of Aflatoxin B1.\n(5) The Scientific Committee for Food has noted that Aflatoxin B1 is a potent genotoxic carcinogen and, even at extremely low doses, contributes to the risk of liver cancer.\n(6) The import of pistachios from Iran therefore constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community and it is imperative to adopt protective measures at Community level.\n(7) An examination of conditions of hygiene in Iran was undertaken by the Commission\u2019s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) for the first time in 1997 and revealed that improvements in hygiene practices and the traceability of pistachios were required. The mission team was unable to check all stages of the handling of pistachios prior to exportation. Commitments were received from the Iranian authorities in particular in relation to improvements in production, handling, sorting, processing, packaging and transport practices. It was therefore appropriate to subject pistachios and certain pistachio products from Iran to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health. Follow up missions have been organised in 1998 and 2001. Although during these missions substantial improvements in hygiene practices and the traceability have been observed, there is a continued need imposing special conditions on pistachios and certain pistachio products from Iran to protect public health.\n(8) Pistachios and certain pistachio products from Iran may be imported, provided that special conditions are applied.\n(9) One of those conditions is that it is necessary to provide that pistachios and products derived from pistachios have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygienic practices. It is necessary to establish the levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving Iran.\n(10) It is furthermore necessary for documentary evidence to be provided by the Iranian authorities to accompany each consignment of pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, relating to the conditions of production, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport and the results of laboratory analysis of the consignment for levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin.\n(11) In the interests of public health, Member States will keep the Commission informed through periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of pistachios and certain pistachio products from Iran. Such reports shall be in addition to the notification obligations under the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(12) It is important to ensure that the sampling and analysis of consignments of pistachios and pistachio products from Iran are performed in a harmonised manner throughout the Community.\n(13) Checks carried out in 2003 and 2004 revealed that a large number of consignments of pistachios from Iran exceeded the maximum level of aflatoxins. It is therefore necessary to restrict the validity of the health certificate in order to limit the duration of transport and storage, when aflatoxins can be formed.\n(14) The operation of this Decision should be kept under review in the light of information and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of Iran and of the results of the tests carried out by Member States in order to assess whether the special conditions provide a sufficient level of protection of public health within the Community and whether they are still needed.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Decision have a significant impact on the control resources of the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to require that all costs resulting from sampling, analysis, storage and all costs resulting from official measures taken as regards non-compliant consignments are to be borne by the importers or food business operators concerned.\n(16) Decision 97/830/EC should accordingly be repealed.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may import\n\u2014 pistachios falling within CN code 0802\u00a050\u00a000, and\n\u2014 roasted pistachios falling within CN codes 2008\u00a019\u00a013 and 2008\u00a019\u00a093,\noriginating in, or consigned from Iran, only where the consignment is accompanied by the results of official sampling and analysis, and the health certificate in Annex I, completed, signed and verified by a representative of the Iranian Ministry of Health.
