That information was also made public by electronic means.\n(4) Within the period of 3 months from those publications, a number of companies indicated an interest in taking over the role of participant for the substances and product-types concerned. However, those companies subsequently failed to submit a complete dossier.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the substances and product types concerned should therefore not be included in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) In the interest of legal certainty, the date should be specified after which biocidal products containing active substances for the product-types indicated in the Annex to this Decision should no longer be placed on the market.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["The substances indicated in the Annex to this Decision shall not be included for the product-types concerned in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.", "For the purposes of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, biocidal products containing active substances for the product-types indicated in the Annex to this Decision shall no longer be placed on the market with effect from 1 July 2012.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJanez POTO\u010cNIK\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nSubstances and product types not to be included in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC\nName EC number CAS number Product-type Rapporteur Member State\nFormaldehyde 200-001-8 50-00-0 1 DE\nFormaldehyde 200-001-8 50-00-0 5 DE\nFormaldehyde 200-001-8 50-00-0 9 DE\nFormaldehyde 200-001-8 50-00-0 23 DE\n2-chloroacetamide 201-174-2 79-07-2 3 EE\n2-chloroacetamide 201-174-2 79-07-2 6 EE\n2-chloroacetamide 201-174-2 79-07-2 13 EE\nThiabendazole 205-725-8 148-79-8 2 ES\nThiabendazole 205-725-8 148-79-8 13 ES\n2,2'-dithiobis[N-methylbenzamide] 219-768-5 2527-58-4 13 PL\nSulphur dioxide 231-195-2 7446-09-5 1 DE\nSulphur dioxide 231-195-2 7446-09-5 2 DE\nSulphur dioxide 231-195-2 7446-09-5 5 DE\nSulphur dioxide 231-195-2 7446-09-5 6 DE\nSulphur dioxide 231-195-2 7446-09-5 13 DE\nReaction product of dimethyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, dimethyl succinate with hydrogen peroxide/Perestane 432-790-1 \u2014 4 HU\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 1 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 1 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 5 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 5 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 6 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 6 FR\nOligo(2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethylguanidinium chloride) Polymer 374572-91-5 13 FR\nPoly(hexamethylendiamine guanidinium chloride) Polymer 57028-96-3 13 FR"}
