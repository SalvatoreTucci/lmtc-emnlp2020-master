In view of this, it is therefore appropriate to grant aid for private storage.\n(3) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that a private storage aid maybe granted for pigmeat and that aid shall be fixed by the Commission in advance or by means of tendering procedure.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products\u00a0(2) has established common rules for the implementation of the private storage aid scheme.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 an aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provides for in Chapter III of that Regulation.\n(6) In order to facilitate the management of the measure, the pigmeat products are classified in categories according to similarities with regard to the level of storage cost.\n(7) The closing date for the submission of applications should depend on market situation and should be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(8) In order to facilitate the administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts, the minimum quantities of products each application must provide for should be fixed.\n(9) A security should be fixed in order to ensure the operators fulfil their contractual obligations and that the measure will have its desired effect on the market.\n(10) Exports of pigmeat products contribute to the restoring of the balance on the market. Therefore, provisions of Article 28(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should apply when the storage period is shortened where products removed from storage are intended for export. Daily amounts to be applied for the reduction of the amount of the aid as referred to in that Article should be fixed.\n(11) For the purpose of application of the first subparagraph of Article 28(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 and for reason of consistency and clarity for operators, it is necessary to express in days the period of 2 months referred therein.\n(12) Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 provides for the information that the Member States have to notify to the Commission. It is appropriate to specify the rules on the notifications within the framework of the present Regulation.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation provides for private storage aid for pigmeat as referred to in Article 31(1)(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The list of categories of products eligible for aid and the relevant amounts are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Applicable rules\nRegulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall apply save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "Submission of applications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 01.02.2011 applications for private storage aid for the categories of pigmeat products eligible for aid under Article 1 of this Regulation may be lodged.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications shall relate to a storage period of 90, 120 or 150 days.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each application shall refer to only one of the categories of products listed in the Annex to this Regulation, indicating the relevant CN code within that category.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The closing date for the submission of applications will be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each application shall cover a minimum quantity of at least 10 tonnes for boned products and 15 tonnes for other products.", "Securities\nThe amount of the security to be lodged in accordance with Article 16(2)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall equal to 20% of the amounts of the aid fixed in columns 3 to 5 of the Annex to this Regulation.", "Removal from storage of product intended for export\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of application of the first sub-paragraph of Article 28(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 the expiry of a minimum storage period of 60 days shall be required.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of application of the third subparagraph of Article 28(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, the daily amounts are set in column 6 of the Annex to this Regulation.", "Communications\nMember States shall notify the Commission each Monday and Thursday by 12:00 (Brussels time) the quantities of products for which applications to conclude contracts have been submitted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 January 2011.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p.1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 223, 21.8.2008, p. 3.\nANNEX\nCategories of products Products in respect of which aid is granted Amount of aid for a storage period of Daily amounts\n90 days 120 days 150 days\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nCategory 1\nex\u00a00203\u00a011\u00a010 Half-carcases without the forefoot, tail, kidney, thin skirt and spinal cord\u00a0(1) 376 398 420 0,74\nCategory 2\nex\u00a00203\u00a012\u00a011 Hams 416 435 455 0,65\nex\u00a00203\u00a012\u00a019 Shoulders\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a011 Fore-ends\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a013 Loins, with or without the neck-end, or neck-ends separately, loins with or without the chump\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(3)\nCategory 3\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Legs, shoulders, fore-ends, loins with or without the neck-end, or neck-ends separately, loins with or without the chump, boned\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(3) 459 479 499 0,67\nCategory 4\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a015 Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut 343 362 381 0,65\nCategory 5\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut, without rind and ribs 369 389 408 0,66\nCategory 6\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Cuts corresponding to \u2018middles\u2019, with or without rind or fat, boned\u00a0(4) 373 395 416 0,73\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The aid may also be granted for half-carcases presented as Wiltshire sides, i.e. without the head, cheek, chap, feet, tail, flare fat, kidney, tenderloin, blade bone, sternum, vertebral column, pelvic bone and diaphragm.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Loins and neck-ends may be with or without rind but the adherent layer of fat may not exceed 25\u00a0mm in depth.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The quantity contracted may cover any combination of the products referred to.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Same presentation as for products falling within CN code 0210\u00a019\u00a020."}
