In the event of an epizootic, no animal may leave a production unit if the competent veterinary authorities decide to prohibit any movement from the production unit, except for the purpose of slaughter. Such animals are taken into account for the purpose of determining the holding's stocking density and the producer could therefore be excluded from eligibility for the extensification payment. So as not to penalise a diligent producer for circumstances beyond his control, a flat-rate correcting coefficient should be applied, from the time of the introduction of the new premium schemes, to the number of livestock units recorded on the holding during the period in question, increased by a certain number of days to permit disposal of the animals, with a view to determining the stocking density, on condition that the producer fulfils certain obligations and without otherwise affecting the principle of extensification.\n(2) Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 of 28 December 1992 establishing an additional levy in the milk and milk products sector(4), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 749/2000(5), and Article 16(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1670/2000(7), mention the word \"available\" when referring to the individual reference quantity of milk. In contrast, Article 32(8)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 uses the word \"allocated\" in referring to the same criterion. For the purposes of legal clarity the same word should always be used when referring to the same criterion. That matter of wording should therefore be settled, to apply from the time of the introduction of the new premium schemes.\n(3) Under the slaughter premium, the maximum time limit of six months for submission of the \"livestock\" aid application provided for in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 has proved inadequate because of problems in managing the measure in its first year of application linked to the operation of the computerised database. Consequently, for animals slaughtered or exported during the first few months of 2000, Member States should be granted the possibility of extending that time limit, from the time of the introduction of the new premium schemes, and to set a final date for that extension.\n(4) For the special, suckler cow and slaughter premiums, Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 provides for the possibility of paying producers an advance of a certain percentage of the aid amount. That possibility is not available for the additional payments referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999. To facilitate correct administration of the payment of those amounts Member States should be allowed to pay a maximum advance on the additional payments.\n(5) Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 lays down the rule applicable to conversion into national currency of the amounts of premiums and of the extensification payment. For reasons of clarity and consistency in the booking of the additional payments to the budget, that rule should also be applied to them.\n(6) The number of dairy cows eligible for the extensification payment in favour of producers whose holdings are located in mountain areas as provided for in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 is fixed by Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999. Pursuant to that Article, that number is equivalent to the number of dairy cows needed to produce the individual milk reference quantity allocated to the producer on 31 March preceding the beginning of the 12-month period of application of the additional levy scheme beginning in the calendar year concerned. Producers located in mountain areas who have both dairy cows eligible for the extensification payment and animals eligible for other direct payments may be forced to refer to two different dates for determination of their individual milk reference quantities. In that case, special measures should be laid down, in accordance with Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, to simplify the administration of that scheme and its application by such producers. The Member States concerned should be given the possibility, as already provided for under Article 44a of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 under other circumstances, to make 1 April the reference date for the number of dairy cows needed to produce the individual milk reference quantity allocated to the producer. That measure applies from 2001 until the end of 2004, the actual date of application of direct payments in the milk and milk products sector.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
