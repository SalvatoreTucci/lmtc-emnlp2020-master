The aim is to improve the statistical data on areas, productions and uses of crops, in particular fruit and vegetables, livestock, and productions and uses of the animal products, particularly milk production.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statistics on the structure of the farms\nStatistics on the structure of the farms are of great importance for the monitoring of the potential of agricultural production. In 2003, therefore before joining the European Union, the 10 adherent countries have carried out a survey on the structure of the agricultural holdings, but they were not obliged to transmit the individual data to Eurostat. The second phase of the TAPAS 2004 annual action plan will enable them to prepare this transmission and to consolidate these statistics. It will also allow methodological work and the implementation of Community typology of the agricultural farms.\nTABLE A\nTechnical action plan 2004, phase 2\nEU-15\nMaximum financial contribution of the Community in incurred expenditure\n(in thousands of euro)\nCOUNTRY BE DK DE EL ES FR IE IT LU NL AT PT FI SE UK TOTAL\nPhysical data  12 20     111        143\nTOTAL  12 20     111        143\nTABLE B\nTechnical action plan 2004, phase 2\nCountries which adhered to the European Union on 1 May 2004\nMaximum financial contribution of the Community in incurred expenditure\n(in thousands of euro)\nCOUNTRY CZ EE CY LV LT HU MT PL SI SK TOTAL\nPhysical data 40 29,7  21,096 14 30,5 28,6  11,25 38 213,146\nStatistics on the structure of the farms  13,95      54 9,9 36 113,850\nTOTAL 40 43,65  21,096 14 30,5 28,6 54 21,15 74 326,996"}
