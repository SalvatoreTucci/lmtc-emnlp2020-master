The fixing of such a maximum amount of aid would lead to the global quantity provided for in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 111/2012 being exceeded. Consequently, in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, the Commission is fixing an allocation coefficient for tenders which have been introduced at the maximum aid level in order to comply with the global quantity laid down.\n(4) In order to send the market a swift signal and ensure that the measure is managed efficiently, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(5) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the tendering sub-period ending on 21 February 2012 under the tendering procedure opened by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 111/2012, the maximum amount of aid for olive oil is hereby fixed in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An allocation coefficient of 84,00456\u00a0% shall apply to tenders introduced at the maximum aid level.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2012.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nJos\u00e9 Manuel SILVA RODR\u00cdGUEZ\nDirector-General for Agriculture and Rural Development\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 10.2.2012, p. 55.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 223, 21.8.2008, p. 3.\nANNEX\nProduct Maximum amount of aid\nExtra virgin olive oil 0,00\nVirgin olive oil 0,65"}
