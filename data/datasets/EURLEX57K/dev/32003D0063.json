However, that Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.\n(2) The early growing in Cuba of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, from seed potatoes supplied by Member States has become an established practice. Part of the early supply of potatoes in the Community has been ensured by imports of such potatoes from Cuba.\n(3) Since 1987 by a succession of Decisions, the most recent being Commission Decision 2001/99/EC(3), derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC, in respect of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in certain provinces of Cuba, have been authorised for limited periods and subject to specific conditions.\n(4) The circumstances justifying those derogations are still valid. There is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.\n(5) The Member States should therefore be authorised to grant derogations, for certain limited periods and subject to specific conditions.\n(6) That authorisation to grant derogations should be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in this Decision are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into the Community or have not been complied with.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["By derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC with regard to the prohibitions referred to in Part A, point 12 of Annex III, Member States may permit the introduction into their territory of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in Cuba, under the conditions laid down in the Annex to this Decision.", "The Member States of importation shall inform the other Member States and the Commission by means of the notification referred to in point 2(b) of the Annex of any use made of the authorisation provided for in Article 1.\nThe Member States of importation shall provide the Commission and the other Member States, before 1 September 2003, 1 September 2004 and 1 September 2005, with the information on the quantities imported pursuant to this Decision and with a detailed technical report of the official examination referred to in point 2(f) of the Annex.
