The programmes are designed to enable the Member State subsequently to initiate the procedures for a zone, or a farm situated in a non-approved zone, to obtain the status of approved zone or of approved farm situated in a non-approved zone, as regards one or more of the fish diseases viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN).\n(2) By letter dated 5 September 2002, Italy applied for approval of the programme to be applied in the farm Incubattoio ittico de valle in the region of Piemonte. At the date of application the farm had been under surveillance since January 2000. However, fish had been introduced from farms which, at the time of introduction, were not approved according to Article 5 or Article 6 of Directive 91/67/EEC.\n(3) The application submitted has been found to comply with Article 10 of Directive 91/67/EEC and should therefore be approved, and Annex II to Decision 2003/634/EC amended accordingly. Due to introduction of fish from non-approved areas, the programme should run for four years from the date of approval.\n(4) By letter dated 20 October 2003, Finland asked for an amendment to the programme listed in Annex I, point 6.2 to Decision 2003/634/EC. Due to an outbreak of VHS in rainbow trout on the west coast of Finland, the authorities have decided to apply eradication measures in that new area, similar to those measures applied in the areas described in Annex I, point 6.2 to Decision 2003/634/EC. The amendment to the programme should therefore be approved.\n(5) Some of the programs approved by Decision 2003/634/EC as regards France and Germany have been finalised. The areas have achieved approved status and been included in Annex I to Commission Decision 2002/308/EC(3). Those areas should therefore be deleted from Annex I to Decision 2003/634/EC.\n(6) Decision 2003/634/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
