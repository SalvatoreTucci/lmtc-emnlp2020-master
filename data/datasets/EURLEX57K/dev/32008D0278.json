No Member State has used this possibility.\n(4) The United Kingdom, as rapporteur Member State, has indicated to the Commission that a detailed examination of the dossier revealed that several additional items of data were still required under Annexes II and III of Directive 91/414/EEC. Accordingly, the dossier can no longer be considered to be complete.\n(5) The notifier for aviglycine HCl informed the United Kingdom and the Commission of its intention not to support the ongoing evaluation any further and not to submit further data. As a result, it is clear that the dossier will be not completed and that it will thus be impossible for the rapporteur Member State to draft an assessment report concerning aviglycine HCl and distribute it to the Commission, the European Food Safety Authority and the other Member States. The possibility of granting provisional authorisations should therefore be withdrawn.\n(6) No period of grace for disposal, storage, placing in the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing aviglycine HCl is necessary as no Member State has granted a provisional authorisation for this active substance.\n(7) Decision 2006/589/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/589/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done in Brussels, 26 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.
