That quota is divided into three subquotas.\n(2) Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1067/2008 divides subquota III (order number 09.4125) into four quarterly subperiods and has fixed the quantity at 594\u00a0597 tonnes for subperiod 3, for the period from 1 July to 30 September 2011.\n(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EC) No 632/2011\u00a0(4) derogates from Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1067/2008 for 2011 by merging subperiods 3 and 4 of subquota III (order number 09.4125) and fixes the quantity at 1\u00a0189\u00a0193 tonnes for subperiod 3, which runs from 1 July to 31 December 2011.\n(4) The notification made under Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1067/2008 shows that the applications lodged between 1 July 2011 at 13:00 and 8 July 2011 at 13:00 (Brussels time), in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) of that Regulation, exceed the quantities available.
