This Directive does not apply to:\n(a)  regenerated cellulose film which, on the side intended to come into contact with foodstuffs or  which, by virtue of its purpose does come into such contact, has a coating exceeding 50 mg/dm2;\n(b)  synthetic casings of regenerated cellulose.", "1.  Only those substances or groups of substances listed in Annex II may be used for  the manufacture of regenerated cellulose film and only under the conditions laid down therein.\n2.  By way of derogation from paragraph 1, substances other than those listed in Annex II may be  used when these substances are employed as colouring matter (dyes and pigments) or as adhesives,  provided that there is no trace of migration of the substances into or onto foodstuffs, detectable  by a validated method.", "Printed surfaces of regenerated cellulose film shall not come into contact with the  foodstuffs.", "1.  At the marketing stages other than the retail stages, materials and articles made  of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs shall be accompanied by  a written declaration in accordance with Article 6 (5) of Directive 89/109/EEC.\n2.  Paragraph 1 does not apply to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film which  by their nature are clearly intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.\n3.

To meet  technical requirements, suitable substances may be added either in the mass or on the surface.  Regenerated cellulose film may be coated on one or both sides.\nANNEX II\nLIST OF SUBSTANCES AUTHORIZED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF REGENERATED CELLULOSE FILM\nNB -  The percentages in this Annex, first and second parts, are expressed in weight/weight (w/w) and  are calculated in relation to the quantity of anhydrous uncoated regenerated cellulose film.\n-  The usual technical denominations are given in square brackets.\n-  The substances used shall be of good technical quality as regards the purity criteria.\nFIRST PART\nUNCOATED REGENERATED CELLULOSE FILM\n>TABLE>\nSECOND PART\nCOATED  REGENERATED CELLULOSE FILM\n>TABLE>\nANNEX III\nCORRELATION TABLE\n>TABLE>"}
