The persisting difficult market situation compromises the financial stability of many farms. The temporary removal of pigmeat from the market seems necessary in order to re-establish market balance and increase of prices. Therefore, it is appropriate to grant aid for private storage for pigmeat and to fix the amount of aid in advance.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008\u00a0(3) has established common rules for the implementation of private storage aid schemes.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in Chapter III of that Regulation.\n(5) In order to facilitate the management of the measure, the pigmeat products should be classified in categories according to similarities with regard to the level of storage cost.\n(6) In order to facilitate the administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts, the minimum quantities of products to be covered by each application should be fixed.\n(7) A security should be fixed in order to ensure the operators fulfil their contractual obligations and that the measure will have its desired effect on the market.\n(8) Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 provides for the information that the Member States have to notify to the Commission. It is appropriate to lay down some specific rules on the frequency of the notifications as regards the quantities applied for within the framework of this Regulation.\n(9) The Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation provides for private storage aid for pigmeat as referred to in point (h) of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The list of categories of products eligible for aid and the relevant amounts are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall apply, save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.", "Submission of applications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 9 March 2015 applications for private storage aid for the categories of pigmeat products eligible for aid referred to in Article 1 may be lodged.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications shall relate to a storage period of 90, 120 or 150 days.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each application shall refer to only one of the categories of products listed in the Annex, indicating the relevant CN code within that category.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each application shall cover a minimum quantity of at least 10 tonnes for boned products and 15 tonnes for other products.", "Securities\nThe amount of the security, by tonne of product, to be lodged in accordance with Article 16(2)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall be equal to 20 % of the amounts of the aid set out in columns 3, 4 and 5 of the table in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Frequency of notifications of the quantites applied for\nMember States shall notify the Commission twice a week the quantities for which applications to conclude contracts have been submitted, as follows:\n(a) each Monday by 12.00 (Brussels time) the quantities for which applications have been submitted on Thursday and Friday of the preceding week;\n(b) each Thursday by 12.00 (Brussels time) the quantities for which applications have been submitted on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the same week.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0346, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products (OJ L\u00a0223, 21.8.2008, p.\u00a03).\nANNEX\nCategories of products Products in respect of which aid is granted Amount of aid for a storage period of\n90 days 120 days 150 days\n1 2 3 4 5\nCategory 1  230 243 257\nex\u00a00203\u00a011\u00a010 Half-carcases without the forefoot, tail, kidney, thin skirt and spinal cord\u00a0(1)\nCategory 2  254 266 278\nex\u00a00203\u00a012\u00a011 Hams\nex\u00a00203\u00a012\u00a019 Shoulders\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a011 Fore-ends\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a013 Loins, with or without the neck-end, or neck-ends separately, loins with or without the chump\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(3)\nCategory 3  281 293 305\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Legs, shoulders, fore-ends, loins with or without the neck-end, or neck-ends separately, loins with or without the chump, boned\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(3)\nCategory 4  210 221 233\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a015 Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut\nCategory 5  226 238 254\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut, without rind and ribs\nCategory 6  228 241 254\nex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 Cuts corresponding to \u2018middles\u2019, with or without rind or fat, boned\u00a0(4)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The aid may also be granted for half-carcases presented as Wiltshire sides, i.e. without the head, cheek, chap, feet, tail, flare fat, kidney, tenderloin, blade bone, sternum, vertebral column, pelvic bone and diaphragm.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Loins and neck-ends may be with or without rind but the adherent layer of fat may not exceed 25 mm in depth.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The quantity contracted may cover any combination of the products referred to.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Same presentation as for products falling within CN code 0210\u00a019\u00a020."}
