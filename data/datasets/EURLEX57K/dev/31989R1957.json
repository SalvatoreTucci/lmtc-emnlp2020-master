whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the  minimum price to be paid to producers, the non-member country price and, if necessary, the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis; whereas, in respect of tomato concentrates, preserved whole peeled tomatoes and tomato juices the volume  of imports makes the non-member country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid for these products must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price;\nWhereas Article 1 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 989/84 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2246/88 (7), fixed as the guarantee threshold for each year a quantity of processed tomato products corresponding to 4 700 000 tonnes of fresh  tomatoes; whereas Community production calculated in accordance with Article 2 (2) of that Regulation does not exceed the threshold for the 1988/89 marketing year and the production of each group of tomato-based products is not higher than the quantity  specified in the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of the same Regulation;\nWhereas the minimum price to be paid to producers in Spain and Portugal and the production aid for the products obtained shall be determined as provided for in Articles 118 and 304 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas the  representative period for determining the minimum price for tomatoes intended for certain uses is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 461/86 of 25 February laying down, on account of the accession of Spain and Portugal, rules on the production aid  system in respect of processed fruit and vegetables (8); whereas as a consequence of Article 1 (2) of that Regulation no production aid can be paid during the transitional period for preserved whole peeled tomatoes and frozen whole tomatoes obtained  from the San Marzano variety grown in Portugal;\nWhereas Articles 118 (3) (b) and 304 (3) (b) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal provide that the grant of production aid to tomato-based products is to be limited to specific quantities; whereas to ensure equitable allocation of raw material  to each of the production regions of the Community, it should be laid down that tomatoes grown in a specific region only attract production aid when processed in that region;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables", "main_body": ["For the 1989/90 marketing year:\n(a) the minimum price referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 to be paid to producers for the products listed in Annex I;
