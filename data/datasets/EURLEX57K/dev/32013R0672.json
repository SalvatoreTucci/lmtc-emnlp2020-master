Article 37 of that Regulation provides for actions to be taken against fishing vessels included in that list.\n(2) The Union list of IUU fishing vessels was established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 468/2010\u00a0(2) and subsequently amended by Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 724/2011\u00a0(3) and (EU) No 1234/2012\u00a0(4).\n(3) According to Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the Union list should comprise fishing vessels included in the IUU vessel lists adopted by regional fisheries management organisations.\n(4) All regional fishery management organisations adopted the principle of publishing an IUU vessel list and update their respective list at their annual meetings\u00a0(5).\n(5) According to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, upon the receipt from regional fisheries management organisations of the lists of fishing vessels presumed or confirmed to be involved in the IUU fishing, the Commission shall update the Union list.\n(6) The Commission has received the updated lists from the annual meetings of the regional fisheries management organisations.\n(7) Considering that the same vessel might be listed under different names and/or flags depending on the time of its inclusion on the regional fisheries management organisations lists, the updated Union list should include the different names and/or flags as established by the respective regional fisheries management organisations.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Part B of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 131, 29.5.2010, p. 22.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 26.7.2011, p. 14.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 350, 20.12.2012, p. 38.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Last updates: CCAMLR: 2012 IUU list as adopted at annual meeting CCAMLR-XXXI 24 October-1 November 2012 and updated on 3 April 2013; SEAFO: SEAFO includes in its IUU list CCAMLR, NEAFC-B and NAFO lists; ICCAT: 2013 IUU List as adopted at annual meeting in November 2012 (Recommendation 11-18); IATTC: 2012 list as adopted in 83rd meeting of IATTC in June 2012; NEAFC: IUU B list AM 2012-8rev1 as adopted at 31st annual meeting 12-16 November 2012; NAFO: At its 34th Annual meeting on 17-21 September 2012, NAFO reviewed its IUU vessel list and noted that there were no necessary changes to the list.
