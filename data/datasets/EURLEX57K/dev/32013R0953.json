Monitors other than those of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data-processing system of heading 8471 are classified under HS subheading 852859.\n(2) In accordance with established case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u00a0(2), the classification of monitors under either HS subheading 852851 or 852859 has to be based on an overall assessment of the objective characteristics and properties of each particular monitor.\n(3) Due to the convergence of digital technologies, it has become very difficult to determine, by reference to mere technical characteristics, whether or not a particular monitor is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data-processing system of heading 8471. In particular, ensuring the correct and uniform classification of flat panel displays which can display, with an acceptable level of functionality, signals from both automatic data-processing systems and other sources, has become technically impossible.\n(4) In order to ensure a rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the territory of the Union and to promote trade between Member States and third countries, it is in the interest of both Union consumers and Union industry to provide for a duty-free treatment for the above-mentioned monitors.\n(5) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amendments to the CN subheadings provided for in this Regulation shall be applicable as TARIC subheadings until 31 December 2013.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 September 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
