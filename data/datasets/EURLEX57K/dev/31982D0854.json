Subcontracts exclusively with parties in one or more Member States shall be automatically included in the cover which may be granted to the principal contractor where the amount of such subcontracts is equal to or less than:\n\u2014 40 % for contracts of a value less than 7\u00a0500\u00a0000 ECU,\n\u2014 3\u00a0000\u00a0000 ECU for contracts of a value between 7\u00a0500\u00a0000 and 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 ECU,\n\u2014 30 % for contracts of a value over 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 ECU.\n2. Where export contracts involve subcontracting both in Member States and in non-member countries, subcontracting in Member States shall be automatically included, in so far as total subcontracting in all countries does not exceed the percentages and limits fixed in paragraph 1 by reference to the value of the contract.\n3. Cover shall be granted to the principal contractor, under the same conditions, whether he has recourse to national subcontracting or to subcontracting in other Member States.\nSECTION III\nFinancing of subcontracts which have been included in cover\nWithout prejudice to application of the customary criteria used in banking matters, treatment equal to that applicable to export contracts comprising exclusively national supplies shall be granted, as regards financing, in respect of export contracts which include subcontracts incorporated in accordance with the provisions of Section II.\nSECTION IV\nExchange of information\n1. A subsequent exchange of information shall take place within the framework of the Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits as regards individual contracts in respect of which subcontracting in non-member countries exceeds 30 % and, in respect of mixed subcontracting both in Member States and in non-member countries, where the total value exceeds that percentage.\n\u2014 such individual contracts are to be considered as exceptional,\n\u2014 a study may at any time be made within the Coordination Group of the difficulties which may arise in connection with certain individual contracts reported within the framework of the subsequent exchange of information,\n\u2014 if experience shows that the subsequent exchange of information procedure is unsatisfactory, the Commission and the Member States may request that ways and means be sought of remedying those aspects that are found to be unsatisfactory.\n3. Where a Member State proposes to conclude with a non-member country an agreement relating to inclusion of subcontracts on a reciprocal basis, the Member State concerned shall submit a preliminary notification to be followed by consultations within the framework of the Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits. The percentages relating to automatic inclusion allowable in such agreements may not \u2014 unless the Council decides otherwise \u2014 exceed 30 % irrespective of whether the subcontracting is in the non-member country with which the agreement has been made or whether subcontracting in other countries is involved.\nSECTION V\nBasis of calculation\nThe percentages and amounts referred to shall be calculated in accordance with the following rules:\n\u2014 costs incidental to export i. e. transport and insurance, are included in the total amount of the contract on which these percentages and amounts are calculated,\n\u2014 financing costs are totally excluded from the amount of the contract, whether itemized or not,\n\u2014 the non-repatriable portion of incidental local expenditure on supplies is not normally deducted from the amount of the contract, it being understood, however, that if this portion exceeds 15 % of the amount of the contract less the costs of financing, the excess will be deducted."}
