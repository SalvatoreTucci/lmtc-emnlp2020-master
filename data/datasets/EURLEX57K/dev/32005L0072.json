That list includes chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl (under the spelling chlorpyriphos and chlorpyriphos-methyl) mancozeb, maneb and metiram.\n(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the Rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92\u00a0(3), the following Rapporteur Member States were designated, which submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. For chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl the Rapporteur Member State was Spain, and all relevant information was submitted on 16 September 1997 and 7 May 1999. For mancozeb, maneb and metiram Italy was designated as Rapporteur Member State and all relevant information was submitted on 3 October 2000, 29 November 2000 and 22 August 2000 respectively.\n(3) The assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The reviews were finalised on 3 June 2005 in the format of the Commission review reports for chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, mancozeb, maneb and metiram.\n(4) The reviews of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, mancozeb, maneb and metiram did not reveal any open question to be addressed by the Scientific Committee on Plants or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which has taken over the role of that Committee.\n(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made, that plant protection products containing chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, mancozeb, maneb and metiram may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that, in all Member States, the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(6) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, mancozeb, maneb and metiram should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for some non-target organisms and in case of maneb, and mancozeb also for developmental toxicity, and that such studies should be presented by the notifiers.\n(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(8) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, mancozeb, maneb or metiram to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(9) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 December 2006 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
