Fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n(4) The total allowable catch (TACs) should be established on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors.\n(5) Preliminary advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimates that the Bay of Biscay anchovy 2014 spawning stock biomass, at the time of spawning, is 66\u00a0158 tonnes. In 2009, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation establishing a long-term plan for the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock. On the basis of that proposal, it is appropriate to fix a TAC of 20\u00a0100 tonnes for the 2014/15 fishing season corresponding to an approximate increase of 18 % compared to the previous TAC.\n(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96\u00a0(2), it is necessary to establish to what extent the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay is subject to the measures laid down in that Regulation.\n(7) From 1 January 2015, the fishery for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay will be subject to the landing obligation provided for in point (a) of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Therefore, under the conditions specified in that Regulation, catches of anchovies in this fishery are to be brought and retained on board the fishing vessels, and are to be recorded, landed and counted against the quotas.\n(8) In view of the start of the 2014/15 fishing season and for the purpose of the annual reporting of catches, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible after its publication and should apply from 1 July 2014,", "main_body": ["Fishing opportunities for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay\nThe total allowable catch (TAC) and its allocation between Member States for the fishing season running from 1 July 2014 until 30 June 2015 for the stock of anchovy in ICES Subarea VIII, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 218/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), shall be as follows (in tonnes live weight):\nSpecies: Anchovy ICES Zone: VIII\nSpain 18\u00a0090 Analytical TAC\nFrance 2\u00a0010\nEU 20\u00a0100\nTAC 20\u00a0100", "Special provisions on allocations of fishing opportunities\nThe allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States as set out in Article 1 shall be without prejudice to:\n(a) exchanges made pursuant to Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(b) deductions and reallocations made pursuant to Article 37 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\u00a0(4);\n(c) reallocations made pursuant to Article 10(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\u00a0(5);\n(d) additional landings allowed under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(e) quantities withheld in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(f) deductions made pursuant to Articles 105, 106 and 107 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009;\n(g) quota transfers and exchanges pursuant to Article 20 of Council Regulation (EU) No 43/2014\u00a0(6).", "Year-to-year management\nThe stock referred to in Article 1 shall be considered subject to an analytical TAC for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 847/96.
