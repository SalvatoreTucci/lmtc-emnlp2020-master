Information provided by the Portuguese authorities, in particular the figures on licences already issued and consignments of soft drinks to the Azores, suggests that the quantity of 6200 tonnes may be insufficient to cover Madeiras licence needs. The quantity should therefore be increased to 6800 tonnes.\n(3) The forecast supply balance for rice per calendar year provides for an annual quantity of 13000 tonnes for the Canary Islands. Information provided by the Spanish authorities shows that this quantity of 13000 tonnes will be insufficient to cover the rice requirements of the Canary Islands. The quantity should therefore be increased to 13700 tonnes.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees for sugar and cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 is amended as follows:\n1. in Annex II - \"MADEIRA - THE AZORES\" - Part 6 is replaced by the table in Annex I to this Regulation;\n2. in Annex III - \"CANARY ISLANDS\" - Part 2 is replaced by the table in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 26.\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 45.\n(3) OJ L 293, 29.10.2002, p. 11.\n(4) OJ L 8, 11.1.2002, p. 15.\n(5) OJ L 337, 13.12.2002, p. 15.\n(6) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\nANNEX I\n\"Part 6\nSugar\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX II\n\"Part 2\nRice\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\""}
