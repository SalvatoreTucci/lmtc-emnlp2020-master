whereas in consequence those producers were not allocated a reference quantity;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 of 31 March 1984 adopting general rules for the application of the levy referred to in Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 in the milk and milk products sector (3) has been amended successively in favour  of those producers by Regulations (EEC) No 764/89 (4) and (EEC) No 1639/91 (5);\nWhereas the Court of Justice in its Judgment of 3 December 1992 in Case C 224/90 declared invalid the second indent of Article 3a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 as provided for in the abovementioned Regulations (EEC) No 764/89 and (EEC) No 1636/91 in  so far as it excludes from the allocation of a special reference quantity the transferees of a premium granted pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1078/77 of 17 May 1977 introducing a system of premiums for the non-marketing of milk and milk  products and for the conversion of dairy herds (6), whereas the transferees have already obtained a reference quantity for another holding pursuant to Article 2 or 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84;\nWhereas the Court of Justice was thereafter minded, in a Judgment handed down on 19 May 1993 in the Case C-81/91, to give an interpretation on the principle of and arrangements for allocating a special reference quantity in the case of a partial  transfer of a holding on which such a quantity was already available pursuant to Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 of 28 December 1992 establishing an additional levy in the milk and milk products sector (7) repealed Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 with effect from 1 April 1993; whereas the inferences should be drawn from the  abovementioned Judgments by adopting a new regulation, having as its object that of allocating, under certain conditions, a special reference quantity to the transferee of all or part of a holding and who had been excluded from such an allocation;\nWhereas in order to take fully into account the decisions of the Court of Justice, it is necessary to adopt provisions that vary depending on whether all or part of the holding has been transferred and in the latter case, whether the holding had or had  not already received a special reference quantity pursuant to Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84;\nWhereas pursuant to Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 the special reference quantity is provisionally, and subsequently definitively, allocated subject to compliance with certain conditions; whereas the said conditions specify in particular that  the applicant concerned must effectively recommence activity as a milk producer which he had to abandon completely; whereas in the present case the transferees concerned are active milk producers, in accordance with Article 9 (c) of Regulation (EEC) No  3950/92; whereas, therefore, for the allocation of the special reference quantity they cannot be subject to conditions that are identical with those laid down in Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84;\nWhereas if the holding, of which part has been transferred, has already received a special reference quantity pursuant to Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 857/84, the said quantity should be shared, in accordance with the Judgment of the Court of  Justice of 19 May 1993, between the transferor and transferee and the necessary rules for such sharing should be drawn up, without prejudice, however, to the possibility of the Member States to have recourse to the national reserve, in cases of  necessity;\nWhereas, should recourse be had to the national reserve, either by way of obligation or option, it should be stipulated that this reserve is to be replenished particularly for that purpose, following the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 and, if  need be, in accordance with Article 5 and the first indent of Article 8 of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.

To this end, the Member States shall determine the criteria to be taken into consideration.", "Until 31 December 1997, where Member States authorize the producers defined in Article 1 to make temporary transfers as referred to in Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92, the special reference quantity shall be transferred to for  the duration of the period concerned to the national reserve.\nIf the event of participation before 1 October 1996 in any measure regarding the definitive abandonment of reference quantities the special reference quantity shall revert to the national reserve referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92,  and compensation shall be paid for the quantity transferred less the said special quantity.\nWhere all or part of the holding formed by the holding acquired plus the other production units operated by the producer is sold or leased before 1 October 1996, the special reference quantity concerned shall revert to the national reserve referred to  in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92, in proportion to the area sold or leased.", "A producer who has received a special reference quantity pursuant to this Regulation shall not be liable for the additional levy for quantites produced before 1 April 1993 which do not exceed the reference quantity he possesses already plus  the said special reference quantity.\nThe producer whose special reference quantity has been reduced pursuant to Article 1 (2), shall not be liable for the levy in respect of milk quantities marketed before 1 April 1994 which do not exceed the quantity which the possessed as at 1 April  1993.", "The provisions of this Regulation shall likewise apply if the holding concerned has been obtained by the producer referred to in Article 1 by way of inheritance or similar means.", "Producers shall submit an application for the allocation of a special reference quantity to the competent authority in the Member State before 1 November 1993.", "Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 1993.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
