whereas certain quantities have therefore already been awarded for importation in 1997; whereas, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95, those quantities must be fully booked under the quantities allocated for 1997 in the Annexes to that Regulation; whereas the quotas laid down in the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 should therefore be adjusted for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 and detailed implementing rules should be laid down for those quantities;\nWhereas Protocol 4 to the Europe Agreements has been amended; whereas the new protocol provides that proof of origin of products imported into the Community may be established by means of a declaration by the exporter, under certain conditions, or by presentation of an EUR.1 movement certificate; whereas, therefore, the new provisions on release for free circulation of imported products should be included in this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2512/96 should be adjusted;\nWhereas, in order for these criteria to be verified, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the applicant is registered for VAT purposes;\nWhereas, in order to ensure orderly importation of the quantities laid down for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, they should be staggered over the year;\nWhereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences;

whereas, moreover, it should be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and, where necessary, after application of a uniform percentage reduction;\nWhereas, in order to ensure efficient management of the arrangements, a security against import licences of ECU 12 per 100 kilograms should be required; whereas, given the risk of speculation inherent in the arrangements, detailed conditions for access to the quotas should be laid down;\nWhereas experience has shown that importers do not always inform the authorities which have issued the import licences of the quantity and origin of the beef and veal imported under the quotas concerned;
