This situation resulted in the suspension of imports of sugar from Mauritius following the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 647/2004 of 6 April 2004 on granting of import licences for cane sugar for the purposes of certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements(5), because licence applications exceeded the delivery obligation concerned for the 2003/04 delivery period.\n(4) So that the obligations provided for in Protocol No 3 on ACP sugar(6) can be complied with for the 2003/04 delivery period, the delivery obligation fixed for Mauritius for the 2003/04 delivery period should be amended.\n(5) Transferring 25376 tonnes of preferential sugar from Mauritius's delivery obligation for 2004/05 to its delivery obligation for 2003/04 will not disturb the supply arrangement referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, and the transferred quantity will be booked for the 2004/05 delivery period subject to verification that the lost licence was never actually used.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The delivery obligations for imports of products falling within CN code 1701 expressed as white sugar equivalent originating in countries which are parties to the ACP Protocol and the India Agreement, for the 2003/04 delivery period and for each exporting country as fixed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 737/2004 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.
