whereas such structural development may be encouraged by appropriate measures supported with Community financial aid;\nWhereas such measures should help to create a fishing fleet that is adapted to likely medium-term catch opportunities in both Community and non-Community waters; whereas these measures should, in particular, be based on an attempt to ensure balanced exploitation of international resources in Community waters;\nWhereas the measures implemented under the Community rules adopted for the decade from 1987 to 1997 are a continuation of the efforts made since 1983 to improve the structural situation up to 31 December 1986 through common measures to restructure, modernize and develop the fisheries sector; whereas, therefore, the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decision 85/281/EEC (1), constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the effort still needed to ensure that the Community objectives are achieved;\nWhereas the objectives of the guidance programme for 1986 have not been fully achieved; whereas the current or likely situation as regards availabilities in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned do not allow for any adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved;

GENERAL REMARKS\nThe programme relates to the whole of the French metropolitan fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Metropolitan France.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n1. The programme must achieve:\n(a) a reduction in the metropolitan fleet in relation to the level anticipated in the previous programme, i.e. the global capacity at 31 December 1991, for the global active fleet (defined as the registered fleet with the exception of boats laid up for more than two years) corresponding to a level of 187 023 GRT and 895 720 kW (1) as set out in the table in point 3;\n(b) a stabilization of the oceanic tuna fleet at the level fixed by the previous programme, i.e. 26 tuna senner freezers representing 61 198 kW in power and a tonnage of 23 410 GRT. No modification of this objective can be made except in the light of concrete possibilities of exploitation in the South Pacific or as a result of significant and enduring modifications to the stock situation.\nIn order to assure, in case of need, the full utilization of tuna availability resulting from existing fishing agreements between the Community and third countries the fishing capacity of the fleet will be adjusted for each season within the maximum limit of 30 oceanic tuna boats, providing that this development does not conflict with the objectives of the programme. This adjustment will be made on the initiative of the Commission without, nevertheless, legitimising an increase in the objective of 26 tuna boats fixed above;\n(c) the modernization of existing vessels;\n(d) a better framework of fishing operations and evolution of the fishery.\n2. With the aim of ensuring compliance with the reduction in actual overall capacity, no capacity transfers between fleets operating in the Mediterranean, in Community waters and other areas will be permitted.\n3. The development of the metropolitan fleet (active vessels) during the period covered by the programme should be within the following limits:\n(Tonnage (GRT))\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // Objective of programme 2908/83 (1)   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987 (1)   // Objective at 31. 12. 1991   //    //   //   //   // Less than 12 m: O.A.   // 31 019   // 30 523   // 30 399   // 12 to 16 m: O.A.   // 19 277  // 19 361   // 19 361   // 16 to 38 m: O.A.   // 71 385  // 68 448   // 68 448   // Over 38 m: O.A.   // 71 126  // 72 696   // 68 815   // Of which:   //   //   //   // - Oceanic tuna fleet (2)   // 26: (23 410)   // 30: (27 142)   // 26: (23 410)   // - Others:   // (47 716)   // (45 554)   // (45 405)  //    //   //   //   // Total  // 192 807   // 191 028 established.

No changes of statistical assessment can be allowed to produce, on the effort of reducing the capacity of the fleet, an effect different from that envisaged in this Decision. France must confirm these data within six months to count from the date of this Decision, or modify them in agreement with the Commission. In case of modification, the objective fixed for 31 December 1991 will be adapted in consequence.\n(2) See the provisions of point II (1) (b) of this Annex.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES\nIn order to attain the measures set out above:\n1. Modernization measures will be restricted to work aimed primarily at improving on-board working, safety conditions, the rationalization of fishing activities, better fish conservation and fuel economies. These modernization actions shall not involve an increase in the individual power and tonnage of the boats in question.\nHowever, for the coastal artisanal fleet, certain modernization measures that result in a limited increase in engine power may be considered if they are aimed at conserving coastal waters by enabling fishing activities to be transferred to more distant waters provided they do not threaten the balance of existing stocks in those waters. In such cases, and within the coastal fleet in question, any possible increase in capacity must be matched by the withdrawal of at least an equivalent amount of working capacity. Moreover, the resultant reduction in fishing activities in coastal waters that are the subject of conservation measures cannot be taken up by other vessels.\n2. Encouragement of definitive laying-up of certain fishing vessels.\nIV. COMMENTS\n1. The overall objective referred to in point II (1) (a) above and the objective for each category of the fleet set out in the above tables may only be revised on the basis of detailed scientific assessments that show the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. Monitoring of the development of the fleet by the French authorities in agreement with the Commission should allow for, where appropriate, the establishment of a relationship between the objectives fixed by this Decision and those which may result from the use of a different statistical basis.\n3. The six-monthly reporting of entries and of withdrawals from the fleet, forseen in Article 2, must take separately into account the withdrawals of boats not operating for two years at least.\n4. At least 10 % of the programme targets should be achieved by the end of 1988, at least 30 % by the end of 1989 and at least 80 % by the end of 1990.\n5. The Commission recalls that any structural financial measures taken by the national, regional or local authorities in respect of the sector concerned must henceforth lie within the scope of this programme.  // 187 023   //    //   //   //\n(1) This objective will be adapted in the case where, in agreement with the Commission, there is a modification of the data derived from the statistical assessment basis on which the objective, in GRT and kW, of the 'programme 2908/83' is"}
