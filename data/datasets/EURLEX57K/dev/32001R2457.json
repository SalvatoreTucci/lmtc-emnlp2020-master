A cumulation of reductions under the different regimes should be avoided.\n(4) The amount of the reduction in the duty applicable to imports of sorghum into Spain must be set at a level that enables the quantities provided for in the Agreement on Agriculture to be imported whilst avoiding disturbance of the Spanish cereals market. In view of the present situation as regards international prices for sorghum and cereals prices on the Spanish market, the amount of the reduction should be set so as to cancel out the import duty currently in force, up to the end of the import period laid down in the Agreement on Agriculture and covering a total maximum quantity of 250000 tonnes.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The reduction in the duty on imports of sorghum into Spain provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 shall be equal to the amount of the import duty in force when the declaration of release for free circulation is made, up to a total volume of 250000 tonnes of sorghum, provided that the declaration is made before 31 December 2001.", "Applications for import licences under this Regulation shall be accepted until the quantity referred to in Article 1 has been reached and, in any event, up to 20 December 2001.\nWhere the total of the quantities for which import licences have been applied for on a particular day exceeds the quantity available on that day, when issuing licences the competent Spanish authority shall apply a reduction coefficient to the quantities covered by applications.\nThe competent Spanish authority shall inform the Commission of the import licence applications submitted each day under this Regulation and of licences issued each day under this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 177, 28.7.1995, p. 4.\n(4) OJ L 256, 10.10.2000, p. 13.\n(5) OJ L 215, 1.8.1998, p. 12."}
