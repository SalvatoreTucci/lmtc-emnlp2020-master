regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2009/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) In the production of European Statistics there should be a balance between the needs of the users and the burden on respondents.\n(2) A technical analysis of the existing data collected under the European legislation on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea and of the dissemination policy has been carried out at European level in order to propose possible technical solutions to simplify, as much as possible, the various activities necessary for the statistical production, while keeping the final output in line with present and foreseeable users\u2019 needs.\n(3) As a result of this analysis, the existing quarterly statistics on passenger transport in the main European ports and the existing quarterly statistics on vessel traffic in the main European ports should be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) and disseminated on an annual basis, while the variable related to the classification dimension \u2018nationality of registration of vessels\u2019 in the existing quarterly statistics on passenger transport in the main European ports should be collected by Member States on a voluntary basis.\n(4) The nomenclature on the maritime coastal areas and the nomenclature on the nationality of registration of vessels need to be adapted to technical developments.\n(5) Directive 2009/42/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee, set up by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Annexes IV, V and

FOR STATISTICAL DATA SETS\nThe data sets specified in this Annex define the periodicity for the maritime transport statistics required by the Community. Each data set defines a cross classification of a limited set of dimensions at different levels of the nomenclatures, aggregated across all other dimensions, for which statistics of good quality are required.\nThe conditions for collecting data set B1 shall be decided by the Council on a proposal from the Commission in the light of the results of the pilot study carried out during a 3-year transitional period, as provided for in Article 10 of Directive 95/64/EC and concerning the feasibility and the cost to Member States and to the respondents of collecting those items of information.\nSUMMARY AND DETAILED STATISTICS\n\u2014 The data sets to be provided for selected ports for goods and passengers are A1, A2, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1 and/or F2.\n\u2014 The data sets to be
