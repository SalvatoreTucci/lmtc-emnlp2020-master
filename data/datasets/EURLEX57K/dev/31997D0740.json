whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13 (4), the intervention of an approved certification body is therefore required;\nWhereas Article 13 (4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;\nWhereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13 (3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;\nWhereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for harmonized standards.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 1997.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30. 8. 1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nMasonry and related products\n- Masonry units of category II to be used in walls, columns and partitions,\n- special masonry units of category II with incorporated thermal insulating materials to be used in walls and partitions and not included in Annex II,\n- factory-made prescribed masonry mortars to be used in walls, columns and partitions,\n- factory-made rendering/plastering mortars to be used in wall, column, partition and ceiling finishes, and\n- ties, tension straps, joist hangers, brackets, support angles, bed joint reinforcement and lintels to be incorporated in masonry walls, columns and partitions.\nANNEX II\nMasonry and related products\n- Masonry units of category I to be used in walls, columns and partitions,\n- special masonry units of category I or II with incorporated thermal insulating materials classified under one of the Euroclasses A, B or C for which the reaction to fire performance either is susceptible to change during the production process (in general, those made with combustible raw materials) or is altered by means of incorporation of certain agents, like fire retardants, to be used in walls and partitions subject to reaction to fire regulations, but only where this material is susceptible to be exposed to fire in its end situation, and\n- factory-made designed masonry mortars to be used in walls, columns and partitions.\nANNEX III\nPRODUCT FAMILY MASONRY AND RELATED PRODUCTS (1/3)\nSystems of attestation of conformity\nFor the product(s) and intended use(s) listed below, CEN/Cenelec are requested to specify the following system(s) of attestation of conformity in the relevant harmonized standard(s):\n>TABLE>\nThe specification for the system should be such that it can be implemented even where performance does not need to be determined for a certain characteristic, because at least one Member State has no legal requirement at all for such characteristic (see Article 2 (1) of Directive 89/106/EEC and, where applicable, clause 1.2.3 of the interpretative documents).
