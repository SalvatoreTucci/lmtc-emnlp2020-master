This derogation expires on 31 December 2007.\n(2) Experience shows that this derogation is broadly applied by the operators. The use of the same production line for organic and non-organic feedingstuffs production separated in time requires the application of appropriate cleaning measures to guarantee the integrity of organic feedingstuffs production. Evidence has been provided that such measures, when rigorously applied under strict control, can be effective.\n(3) Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91\u00a0(2) provides for the production of processed organic feed to be separated from production of processed non-organic feed either in time or space.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to prolong the derogation until Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 enters into application from 1 January 2009.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["In Part E of Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, in the second paragraph of point 3 the date \u201831 December 2007\u2019 is replaced by the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
