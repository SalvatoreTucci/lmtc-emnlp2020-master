This is the first reported outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country since 1994 and the first ever in relation to the serotype of the virus identified in the OIE Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Pirbright, United Kingdom.\n(3) The competent authorities in Libya have taken measures to contain the disease by the stamping out of infected animals, isolation of herds, movement restrictions and surveillance.\n(4) The Community does not allow imports of live animals of susceptible species or their products from Libya. Importation of animals to the Community primarily relates to re-entry of registered horses in accordance with Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(3).\n(5) However, transport vehicles used for transport of animals on arrival from Libya to the European Union may cause a potential risk of harbouring virus. It is therefore necessary to rapidly adopt certain protection measures at Community level which take into account the survival of the foot-and-mouth disease virus in the environment and potential routes of virus transmission.\n(6) Consequently, the presence of foot-and-mouth disease in Libya is liable to constitute a serious risk to the susceptible livestock population of the Community.\n(7) Proper cleansing and disinfection of animal transport vehicles is the most appropriate way to reduce the risk of rapid virus transmission over large distances.\n(8) Taking into account the significant delay between the first suspect on 1 May 2003 and the confirmation of the disease, a spread of the disease to neighbouring countries cannot be fully excluded and may require an extension of the geographical scope of this Decision.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision \"livestock vehicle\" means any motor vehicle being used or which has been used for transport of animals.", "1.

The documentation shall provide information on cleansing and disinfection equivalent to that shown in Annex II to this Decision.\n2.
