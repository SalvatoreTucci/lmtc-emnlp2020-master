whereas those areas are listed in Annex III to that Regulation and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 (3) which determines the mountain areas in which the premium may be granted;\nWhereas Article 5 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the possibility of the premium being granted to producers keeping female sheep of certain mountain breeds other than ewes which are eligible for the premium in certain areas;\nWhereas those ewes and areas are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3524/85 (5);\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the loss of income represents, per 100 kilograms of carcase weight, any difference there may be between the basic price and the arithmetical mean of the market prices recorded for each region;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the amount of the premium payable per ewe and per region is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in paragraph 2 by a coefficient representing, for each region, the normal average annual production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase weight;\nWhereas, however, for region 5, this loss of income must be reduced by the weighted average of the variable premiums actually granted for the 1985 marketing year, such average being obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of that Article;\nWhereas Article 5 (3) also fixes the amount of the premium payable per female goat at 80 % of the premium per ewe;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (9), the amount of the premium per female sheep, other than a ewe which is eligible for the premium, is also fixed at 80 % of the premium per ewe;\nWhereas, by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3728/86 (7), the Member States were authorized to pay an advance to producers located in less-favoured agricultural areas; whereas such an advance was paid during the 1986 marketing year to the producers in question;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 4 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3007/84 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1514/86 (9), the Member States in region 1 are not authorized to make a payment on account of the premium referred to in Article 5 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80; whereas, however, in view of the current quite exceptional situation on the markets in region 1, and the fact that a large number of lambs have not been slaughtered but kept on holdings, Greece and Italy were authorized, by way of derogation from Article 4 (4), to make a payment on account of the said premium;\nWhereas the French Government has decided to come to the assistance of farmers whose holdings are located in areas which are not less-favoured; whereas, to that end, the French Government has proposed making an advance to them also, but out of national funds, of an amount corresponding to 75 % of the ewe premium which such farmers may claim at the end of the marketing year, namely March 1987;\nWhereas the French Government has notified the Commission of this planned national aid in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the Treaty;\nWhereas the Council decided by Decision 86/648/EEC (10) to regard the national aid in the form of a payment on account of the premium for ewes, granted by the French Government to French sheepmeat producers whose holdings are located in areas of France which are not less-favoured, as being compatible with the common market, up to a rate of 75 % of the estimated premium and until the end of the 1986 marketing year;\nWhereas the premium payable per eligible animal is paid only if the amount fixed per ewe is one ECU or more;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1873/80, the amount of the definitive premium and the balance to be paid in the less-favoured agricultural areas should be fixed;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["The loss of income recorded for the 1986 marketing year for the regions listed below is as follows:\n1.2 // Region   // Difference in ECU per 100 kg   // 2  // 81,234   // 3   // 75,765   // 4   // 135,467   // 5  // 127,772   // 6   // 114,413   // 7   // 49,300.", "1.
