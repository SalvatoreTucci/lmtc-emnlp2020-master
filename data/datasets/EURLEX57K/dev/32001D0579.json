That communication includes standard EN 71-1: 1998 concerning the safety of toys, but it excludes the C-weighted peak emission sound pressure level produced by a toy using percussion caps.\n(7) The reason for the exclusion was that Clause 4.20(d) of standard EN 71-1: 1998, could not ensure the safety of toys when used in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children, as was required by Article 2 of Directive 88/378/EEC.\n(8) Pursuant to standard EN 71-1: 1998, Clause 4.20(d), the C-weighted peak emission sound pressure level, Lpc peak, produced by a toy using percussion caps may not exceed 140 dB: 140 dB at the measurement position corresponds to 150-160 dB at a distance of approximately 2,5 cm. The limit-value of 140 dB remains in force until 31 July 2001, after which date the limit-value is set at 125 dB,", "main_body": ["The publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the reference to harmonised standard EN 71 \"Safety of toys - Part 1: Mechanical and physical properties\", as adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 15 July 1998 and as shown in the Annex, shall be accompanied by the following information note: \"Clause 4.20(d) of standard EN 71-1: 1998 will allow presumption of conformity to the provisions of Directive 88/378/EEC only as from 1 August 2001.
