Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.\n(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.\n(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.\n(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC\u00a0(3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n(5) Germany notified the Commission of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in a holding on its territory where poultry or other captive birds are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones.\n(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Germany, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holding where the outbreak was confirmed.\n(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly define the protection and surveillance zones established in Germany at Union level in collaboration with that Member State.\n(8) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, the protection and surveillance zones in Germany, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(9) This Decision is to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Germany shall ensure that the protection and surveillance zones established in accordance with Article 16(1) of Directive 2005/94/EC comprise at least the areas listed as protection and surveillance zones in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply until 22 December 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2014.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (OJ L\u00a010, 14.1.2006, p.\u00a016).\nANNEX\nPart A\nProtection zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name\nDE Germany Postal code Area comprising:\n17379 Heinrichswalde, Heinrichswalde\n17379 Rothem\u00fchl, Rothem\u00fchl\n17379 Wilhelmsburg, M\u00fchlenhof\nPart B\nSurveillance zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name\nDE Germany Postal Area comprising:\n17098 Friedland\n17099 Galenbeck, Friedrichshof\n17099 Galenbeck, Galenbeck\n17099 Galenbeck, Klockow\n17099 Galenbeck, Kotelow\n17099 Galenbeck, Rohrkrug\n17099 Galenbeck, Schwichtenberg\n17099 Galenbeck, Schwichtenberg\n17099 Galenbeck, Wittenborn\n17309 Jatznick, Klein Luckow\n17309 Jatznick, Waldesh\u00f6he\n17337 Gro\u00df Luckow, Gro\u00df Luckow\n17337 Gro\u00df Spiegelberg, Gro\u00df Spiegelberg\n17337 Sch\u00f6nhausen, Sch\u00f6nhausen\n17337 Sch\u00f6nhausen\n17349 Sch\u00f6nbeck, Sch\u00f6nbeck\n17349 Voigtsdorf, Voigtsdorf\n17379 Altwigshagen, Altwigshagen\n17379 Altwigshagen, Demnitz\n17379 Ferdinandshof, Ferdinandshof\n17379 Heinrichsruh, Heinrichsruh\n17379 Rothem\u00fchl, Rothem\u00fchl\n17379 Wilhelmsburg, Eichhof\n17379 Wilhelmsburg, Fleethof\n17379 Wilhelmsburg, Friedrichshagen\n17379 Wilhelmsburg, Mariawerth\nBrandenburg\n17337 Municipality of Uckerland including the parts Hansfelde and Wismar.
