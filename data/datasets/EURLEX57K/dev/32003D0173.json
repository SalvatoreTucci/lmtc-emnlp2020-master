However, in view of the specificity of poultry production, movements of day-old chicks and poultry for immediate slaughter may be authorised within Belgium.\n(5) The same prohibitions should apply to exports to third countries in order to protect their health status and to prevent the risk of re-entry of these consignments in another Member State.\n(6) These measures should be adopted at Community level for the sake of clarity and transparency.\n(7) The situation shall be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 13 March 2003,", "main_body": ["1.
