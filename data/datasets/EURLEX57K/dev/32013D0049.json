In that report it came to the conclusion that synthetic zeaxanthin with a maximum intake for not more than 20\u00a0mg per person per day, would not present a significant risk for human health. However, it concluded that the data presented were not sufficient to complete the safety assessment.\n(3) Therefore an additional assessment was required.\n(4) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 1 August 2005 for additional comments.\n(5) On 2 February 2007 the applicant informed the Commission that the use of zeaxanthin should be limited to be used only as an ingredient in food supplements.\n(6) The Commission consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 20 March 2007.\n(7) On 24 April 2008 the EFSA adopted a Scientific Opinion on the safety of \u2018synthetic zeaxanthin as an ingredient in food supplements\u2019\u00a0(2) concluding that based on the existing data, the safety of synthetic zeaxanthin as an ingredient in food supplements at the proposed level of 20\u00a0mg per person per day has not been established.\n(8) On 25 January 2012 the applicant provided additional information and proposed an intake of synthetic zeaxanthin as an ingredient in food supplements of up to 2\u00a0mg per person per day.\n(9) Following a request from the Commission, EFSA was asked to update its opinion on the safety of synthetic zeaxanthin as a novel food ingredient in food supplements in the light of the additional information. On 13 September 2012, EFSA adopted a \u2018Statement on the safety of synthetic zeaxanthin as an ingredient in food supplements\u2019\u00a0(3) concluding that the use level proposed by the applicant does not raise safety concerns.\n(10) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that synthetic zeaxanthin complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(11) The intentional addition of synthetic zeaxanthin to food for colouring purposes falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives\u00a0(4) and should be authorised in accordance with that Regulation.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Synthetic zeaxanthin as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient in food supplements at the maximum intake recommended by the manufacturer of up to 2\u00a0mg per day.", "The designation of synthetic zeaxanthin authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018synthetic zeaxanthin\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to DSM Nutritional Products, Alexander Fleminglaan 1, 2613 AX Delft, The Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 January 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal (2008) 728, 1-27.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012: 10(10):2891.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\nANNEX\nSPECIFICATIONS OF SYNTHETIC ZEAXANTHIN\nDefinition Zeaxanthin is a naturally occurring xanthophyll pigment, it is an oxygenated carotenoid.
