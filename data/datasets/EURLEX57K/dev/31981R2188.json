Scope and field of application\nThis method allows the determination of rennet whey in skimmed-milk powder intended for public storage.\n2. Principle of the method\nWhen milk is coagulated as by renneting, some glycomacropeptides of casein, with a high content of a sialic acid, are freed. The dosage of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) allows the detection of rennet whey eventually present in skimmed-milk powder. After reconstitution of milk powder, glycomacropeptides, including sialic acid, are removed from a filtrate containing 12 % trichloroacetic acid by precipitation with phosphotungstic acid.\nSialic acid, freed by acid hydrolysis, forms, with resorcinol, a coloured complex measured by visible spectrophotometry at 580 nm.\n3. Reagents\nAll reagents shall be of analytical grade. The water used shall be distilled or deionized.  3.1. Trichloroacetic acid solution (TCA)\nDissolve 240 g of trichloroacetic acid in water and dilute to 1 000 ml.\n3.2.

Preparation of the sample\nAfter homogenization, the sample is examined in accordance with the instructions given under paragraph 6 and there on.\n6. Procedure  6.1. Isolation of free sialic acid  6.1.1. Weigh 5 \u00b1 0.005 g of skimmed-milk powder into a glass beaker of 150 ml. After the addition of a magnetic stirrer bar (4.2) the sample is completely dissolved by stirring in 50 ml of water.\nAdd, by stirring, 50 ml of TCA solution (3.1). Allow to stand for about 30 minutes (at room temperature).\n6.1.2. Stir and filter immediately (4.8).\n6.1.3. Introduce into a centrifuge tube (4.5) 50 ml of the filtrate taken 60 minutes after the commencement of filtration.\n1 ml of phosphotungstic acid solution (3.2) is added. Make the solution homogenous by stirring. After standing for 10 minutes at room temperature, the precipitate is separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3 000 g.\n6.1.4. The supernatant liquid is discarded. The sediment is washed twice with 5 ml of ethanol (3.3). Take care to mix well with a magnetic stirrer or a glass rod (4.16). (If a glass rod is used, introduce 2 ml of ethanol to disperse the precipitate, washing the glass rod with the remaining 3 ml of ethanol.)\nAfter each treatment, centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3 000 g. The sediment is dried either overnight at room temperature or at at 35 \u00baC for 90 minutes.\n6.1.5. Add to the dried sediment 4 ml of 0 71 N sulphuric acid (3.4), mix thoroughly to disperse it. Close the containers and place them in a water bath at 80 \u00baC for 40 minutes, stirring from time to time to ensure complete dispersion.\nAfter cooling to room temperature, add 4 ml of acetate buffer (3.5) and again mix carefully.\n6.1.6. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3 000 g. The determination of sialic acid or N-acetyl-neuraminic acid is carried out on the supernatant liquid.\n6.2. Spectrophotometric determination of free sialic acid  6.2.1. Put 2 ml of the supernatant into a reagent tube (4.12) and add 2 ml resorcinol reagent (3.8).\n6.2.2. Close the tube and mix carefully. Place the tubes in a water bath at 100 \u00baC for exactly 15 minutes (4.7), followed by cooling to room temperature in running water.\n6.2.3. Add 5 ml of iso-amyl-alcohol (3.9). Close the tubes, mix by vigorous shaking and place them in ice-water for 15 minutes.\n6.2.4. Centrifuge the tubes for 2 minutes at 1 000 g in order to clarify both layers.\n6.2.5. Transfer about 3 ml of the upper layer (iso-amyl-alcohol layer) into a glass optical cell and measure the extinction at 580 nm against the blank sample not later than 30 minutes after removing the tubes from the ice-water.\n6.3. Blank test\nPrepare a blank sample as described in 6.2.1 to 6.2.5 with the use of 1 ml 0 71 N sulphuric acid (3.4) and 1 ml acetate buffer (3.5) instead of 2 ml filtrate as described under 6.2.1.\n6.4. Calibration curve  6.4.1. Introduce precisely 0-2-5-10 -20 and 30 ml, corresponding to 0-0 74-1-2-4-6 mg sialic acid, of the solution (3.10) into 50-ml volumetric flasks ; dilute to 50 ml with 0 71 N (3 74) sulphuric acid, mix by vigorous shaking.\n6.4.2. 1 ml solution of each volumetric flask is mixed in a test tube (4.12) with 1 ml of acetate buffer (3.5), in order to obtain a range of standard solutions containing 0 (0 value) 8, 20, 40, 80, 120 micrograms of sialic acid respectively.\nMix carefully and follow the procedure according to 6.2.2 to 6.2.5.\n6.4.3. In order to establish a calibration curve, prepare a graph of extinctions obtained as under 6.4.2 versus the corresponding sialic acid concentrations in micorgrams according to 6.4.2.\n7. Expression of the results  7.1. Calculation\nCalculate the sialic acid content expressed as micrograms per gram using the following formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0020414\">\nwhere C is the mass of sialic acid in micrograms, evaluated from the calibration curve according to the extinction, obtained under 6.2.5 and E is the amount of the sample (6.1.1) in grams. Report the results to the nearest one microgram.\n7.2. Repeatability\nThe difference between the results of a determination in duplicate achieved almost simultaneously by or in rapid succession by the same analyst shall not exceed 5 % of the arithmetic mean of the results.\n8. Interpretation of the results\nThis method enables the presence of whey in the skimmed-milk powder to be quantified.  8.1. Calculation of the average value of the free sialic acid in micrograms per gram of the sample related to its content of protein expressed in percentage (m/m):\nY = 40 + 3 (X - 34)2\nwhere:\n40 = the average content of sialic acid in micrograms per gram in respect of a skimmed-milk powder containing at least 34 % protein,\nX = total protein content (%) determined by Kjeldahl Procedure FIL : IDF 20 : 1962.\n8.2. Calculation of percentage of whey powder which may be present: >PIC FILE= \"T0020415\">\nwhere:\nZ = the content in sialic acid of the sample as determined in 7.1 expressed in micrograms per gram,\nY = the average content of free sialic acid in the sample as calculated in 8.1.\n10 = by convention the free sialic acid content expressed in micrograms of one gram of rennet whey powder.\n8.3. Allowing for errors in the method and natural variations in the composition of the sample it may be concluded that whey is absent when the value obtained in 8.2 is 2 70 or less.\nIn cases where higher values are obtained the presence of whey is confirmed and is quantified according to the formula given in 8.2.\""}
