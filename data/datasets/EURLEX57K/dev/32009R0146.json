Cameroon is thus currently listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005.\n(4) A Community inspection carried out in Cameroon in 2003 revealed serious shortcomings as regards hygiene in the handling of fishery products and in the capacity of the competent authorities of that third country to carry out reliable checks on fishery products. Accordingly, Cameroon cannot provide the necessary guarantees that fishery products have been obtained in conditions at least equivalent to those governing the production and placing on the market of fishery products in the Community. Following the inspection, Cameroon suspended its exports of fishery products to the EU.\n(5) Since 2004, Cameroon\u2019s competent authority has not informed the Community of progress in the implementation of corrective action to remedy to the shortcomings observed in 2003. In 2008, Cameroon declined a Community on-the-spot inspection arguing that no Cameroonian fishery establishment or vessel envisages exporting fishery products to the EU in the short term.\n(6) Imports into the Community of fishery products from Cameroon should therefore no longer be authorised.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 February 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55, as corrected by OJ L 226, 25.6.2004, p. 22.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206, as corrected by OJ L 226, 25.6.2004, p. 83.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 338, 22.12.2005, p. 83.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX II\nList of third countries and territories from which imports of fishery products in whatever form for human consumption may be permitted\nAO \u2014 ANGOLA\nAZ \u2014 AZERBAIJAN\u00a0(1)\nBJ \u2014 BENIN\nCG \u2014 REPUBLIC OF CONGO\u00a0(2)\nER \u2014 ERITREA\nIL \u2014 ISRAEL\nMM \u2014 MYANMAR\nSB \u2014 SOLOMON ISLANDS\nSH \u2014 SAINT HELENA\nTG \u2014 TOGO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Authorised only for imports of caviar.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Authorised only for imports of fishery products caught, frozen and packed in their final packaging at sea.\u2019"}
