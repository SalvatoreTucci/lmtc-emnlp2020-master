Such a development would be likely to cause budget problems for the Community.\n(2) An intervention threshold was fixed for tomatoes for the 2000 marketing year in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2715/1999(3). Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product, a new threshold should be set for the 2001 marketing year equal to that set for the 2000 marketing year, and the period to be taken into account for the assessment of the overrun of the threshold should also be determined.\n(3) Pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27, an overrun of the intervention threshold results in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following the year in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of such an overrun should be determined and a reduction in proportion to the size of the overrun fixed, but restricted to a certain percentage.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1. The intervention threshold for tomatoes for the 2001 marketing year shall be 360000 tonnes.\n2. The overrun of the intervention threshold laid down in paragraph 1 shall be assessed on the basis of withdrawals effected between 1 November 2000 and 31 October 2001.", "If the quantity subject to withdrawals during the period set in Article 1(2) exceeds the threshold set in Article 1(1), the Community withdrawal compensation set in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for the following marketing year shall be reduced in proportion to the size of the overrun based on the production used to calculate the relevant threshold.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 December 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 311, 12.12.2000, p. 9.\n(3) OJ L 327, 21.12.1999, p. 34."}
