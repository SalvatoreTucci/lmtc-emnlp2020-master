The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0 and\u00a062,6\u00a0% on imports of PET film originating in India.\n(2) On 22\u00a0August 2001, the Commission, by Decision 2001/645/EC\u00a0(3), accepted undertakings offered by five Indian producers: Ester Industries Limited (Ester), Flex Industries Limited (Flex), Garware Polyester Limited (Garware), MTZ Polyfilms Limited (MTZ) and Polyplex Corporation Limited (Polyplex).\n(3) On 22\u00a0November 2003\u00a0(4), the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01676/2001 limited to the form of the definitive anti-dumping measures.

On this basis, and also in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertakings in question, which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertakings, the Commission has decided to withdraw the acceptance of the undertakings.\n(5) The Commission informed the Indian authorities and the Indian exporting producers concerned in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0365/2006 that it proposed to withdraw the acceptance of the current undertakings. The interested parties were given the opportunity to\u00a0comment.\n(6) These comments are addressed in recitals 27 to\u00a031 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0365/2006.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF DECISION 2001/645/EC\n(7) In the light of the above, Decision 2001/645/EC accepting undertakings from Ester Industries Limited (Ester), Flex Industries Limited (Flex), Garware Polyester Limited (Garware), MTZ Polyfilms Limited (MTZ) and Polyplex Corporation Limited (Polyplex) should be repealed.\n(8) In parallel to this Decision, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0366/2006\u00a0(6), has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports into the Community of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India,", "main_body": ["Decision 2001/645/EC is hereby repealed.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13\u00a0February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L\u00a056, 6.3.1996, p.\u00a01.
