For reasons of administrative simplification some codes should also be deleted, merged with other codes or shortened.\n(3) To reduce the burden on drivers with disabilities, it should be made possible where appropriate for those drivers to drive a vehicle without technical adaptation. Since modern vehicle technology allows drivers to operate certain regular vehicles with limited force, e.g. for steering or braking, and in order to enhance flexibility for drivers whilst ensuring safe operation of the vehicle, codes should be introduced that could allow driving of vehicles which are compatible with the maximum force the driver is able to produce.\n(4) Certain codes which are currently restricted to medical conditions may also be relevant for other road safety purposes by limiting high risk situations, e.g. in the case of novice or elderly drivers. Thus a section should also be created for these codes on limited use.\n(5) To enhance road safety, several Member States have or are planning programmes restricting drivers to drive only vehicles equipped with an alcohol interlock. To facilitate the deployment and acceptance of alcohol interlock devices and taking into account the recommendation of the Study on the prevention of drink-driving by the use of alcohol interlock devices\u00a0(2), a harmonised code should be introduced for this purpose.\n(6) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents\u00a0(3), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n(7) Directive 2006/126/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on driving licences,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2006/126/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2017 at the latest.
