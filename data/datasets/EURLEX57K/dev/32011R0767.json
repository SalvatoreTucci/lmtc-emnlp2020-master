Therefore, the procedure referred to in Article 27(4) of Directive 92/83/EEC has been duly followed. Following discussion in the Committee on Excise Duties, the Czech Republic revised its original proposal so that the proposed requirements should not give rise to evasion, avoidance or abuse.\n(6) In accordance with Article 27(5) of Directive 92/83/EEC, Poland notified the Commission on 26 May 2010 that it had detected abuse of completely denatured alcohol, exempted from excise duty pursuant to Article 27(1)(a) of Directive 92/83/EEC, and denatured according to the method of Latvia authorised by Regulation (EC) No\u00a03199/93, which is a mixture of a minimum amount of 3 litres of isopropyl alcohol and 2 grams of denatonium benzoate per 100 litres of spirit.\n(7) The Commission transmitted the communication of Poland to the other Member States on 25 June 2010.\n(8) Subsequent responses to the communication and discussion in the Committee on Excise Duties indicated that the majority of Member States were in agreement with the position of Poland. In response to the concerns raised by Poland, Latvia communicated to the Commission the agreement to amend its method of denaturing as provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a03199/93.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No\u00a03199/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Excise Duties,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No\u00a03199/93 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 31.10.1992, p. 21.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 288, 23.11.1993, p. 12.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No\u00a03199/93 is amended as follows:\n(1) the entry concerning the Czech Republic is replaced by the following:\n\u2014 1 gram denatonium benzoate,\n\u2014 0,2 litres thiophene,\n\u2014 1 litre methylethylketone (butanone), and\n\u2014 0,2 grams methylene blue (CI basic blue 52015);\n\u2014 0,4 litres solvent naphtha,\n\u2014 0,2 litres kerosine, and\n\u2014 0,1 litres technical petrol;\n\u2014 3 litres ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), CAS: 637-92-3,\n\u2014 1 litre isopropyl alcohol (IPA), CAS: 67-63-0,\n\u2014 1,0 litres unleaded petrol (BA 95 Natural), CAS: 86290-81-5,\n\u2014 10 miligrams fluorescein, CAS: 2321-07-05.\u2019;\n(2) The entry concerning Latvia is replaced by the following:\n1. mix of following substances:\n\u2014 isopropyl alcohol 9 litres,\n\u2014 acetone 1 litre,\n\u2014 methylene blue or thymol blue or crystallic violet 0,4 grams;\n2. mix of following substances:\n\u2014 methylethylketone 2 litres,\n\u2014 methylisobutylketone 3 litres;\n3. mix of following substances:\n\u2014 acetone 3 litres,\n\u2014 denatonium benzoate 2 grams;\n4. ethyl acetate 10 litres.\n1. benzine or petroleum minimum 5 litres and maximum 7 litres.\u2019"}
