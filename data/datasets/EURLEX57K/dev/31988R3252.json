Imports from third countries into Portugal of cereals listed in Article 1 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, except for common wheat, shall be subject to a levy equal to the threshold price fixed by the Portuguese authorities, less the cif price fixed by those authorities in accordance with criteria similar to those laid down by Community provisions.\nThe threshold price fixed to that end at the beginning of the marketing year may subsequently vary by product or by period should the need to dispose of national production so dictate. Levies fixed in advance shall be adjusted according to the threshold price in force at the time of import.\n2. The levy calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 shall remain applicable even through it is lower than that fixed for the Community as a whole under Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75.", "Imports into Portugal of cereals, except for common wheat, listed in Article 1 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 and coming from other Member States shall be subject to a levy equal to the threshold price provided for in Article 2 (1), less the cif price for Portugal calculated on the basis of the most favourable offers from the Community market. The difference between the levy on imports from the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 and that on imports from Spain shall be equal to the accession compensatory amount applicable in trade between the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 and Spain.\nThe last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 2 (1) shall apply to the levy provided for in the first paragraph.\nII\nCommon wheat and durum wheat", "1. Imports into Portugal of common wheat and durum wheat shall be liberalized to the following extent at least:\n- 1988: 100 000 tonnes,\n- 1989: all imports.\n2.

That difference shall in turn be adjusted by the accession compensatory amount depending on whether tenders relate to products coming from the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 or to products coming from Spain.\nIII\nGeneral provisions", "Portugal shall notify the Commission:\n- before implementation, of provisions for implementing this Regulation and in particular of the threshold prices adopted,\n- of levies fixed.", "An import licence shall be required for all cereals imported under this Regulation.
