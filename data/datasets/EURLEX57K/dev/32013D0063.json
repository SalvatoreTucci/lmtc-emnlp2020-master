A health claim is any voluntary commercial message or representation in any form such as words, statements, pictures, logos, etc. which states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between the food that is the subject of the claim and health.\nArticle 10 lays down specific conditions for the permitted use of authorised health claims. It should be observed together with the general principles and requirements for all claims (e.g. Article 3 of the Regulation and provisions of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(1) and Council Directive 84/450/EEC\u00a0(2) that operators using health claims must also respect), with the conditions for the use of nutrition and health claims set in Article 4 and with the general conditions for all claims provided in Article 5 as well as with the specific conditions of use foreseen in the list of permitted health claims. For example, in the case of \u2018reduction of disease risk\u2019 health claims referred to in point (a) of Article 14(1), additional information is required in Article 14(2). It is important to note that even authorised health claims may not be used unless their use fully complies with all the requirements of the Regulation. Accordingly, even where a claim is authorised and included in the lists of permitted health claims, national authorities should take action if its use does not comply with all the requirements of the Regulation.\nIt would be easier to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Regulation and in particular Article 10, if the food business operator is able to demonstrate due diligence and steps taken to comply with each part of the Regulation.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prohibition of unauthorised health claims and of health claims the use of which does not comply with the Regulation \u2013 Article 10(1)\nArticle 10(1) provides that all health claims are prohibited unless: a) authorised by the Commission and b) their use complies with the provisions of the Regulation. Health claims must have been authorised under the appropriate procedure provided in the Regulation and been inserted in one of the lists of permitted health claims referred to in Article 13(3) and Article 14(1). Health claims which are not authorised (not inserted in one of the lists of permitted health claims) and health claims which have been authorised (inserted in one of the lists of permitted health claims) but their use does not comply with the rules set out in the Regulation are prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mandatory information accompanying authorised health claims \u2013 Article 10(2)\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distinction of three cases for the implementation of Article 10(2)\nIn order to comply with the Regulation, Article 10(2) requires two, or where appropriate, four pieces of mandatory information to be provided to the consumer when using a health claim. The information laid down in points (a) to (d) of Article 10(2) must be given in the labelling of the food, or in its presentation and advertising if no such labelling exists. This provision should be understood in the light of the objective of the legislator to ensure a high level of consumer protection by providing accurate and truthful information to help consumers make an informed choice.\n\u2018Labelling\u2019, is defined in point (a) of Article 1(3) of Directive 2000/13/EC and point (j) of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3). That definition states that \u2018\u201clabelling\u201d means any words, particulars, trade marks, brand name, pictorial matter or symbol relating to a food and placed on any packaging, document, notice, label, ring or collar accompanying or referring to such food\u2019\u2019. In the Union law there is a definition of \u2018advertising\u2019\u00a0(4), but no definition of \u2018presentation\u2019, which should therefore be understood in the light of the explanation provided for in point (a) of Article 2(3) of Directive 2000/13/EC and point (b) of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.\nA health claim can be made on the \u2018labelling\u2019 which can mean more than just the label, since it encompasses all the information to the consumer about the food which it accompanies or refers to. The distinction between \u2018labelling\u2019 and \u2018advertising\u2019 is that \u2018labelling\u2019 is concerned with the delivery of the food to the final consumer, while \u2018advertising\u2019 is about the promotion of the supply of food by the food business operator.\n(a) In order to comply with Article 10(2), it is necessary to include the mandatory information in the labelling of the food for which the health claim is made.\n(b) Where no \u2018labelling\u2019 exists, the mandatory information shall be given in the \u2018advertising\u2019 and \u2018presentation\u2019 of the food for which the health claim is made. For example, where a health claim is used in a generic advertising for a food (e.g. olive oil, dairy, meat, etc.) which does not link it to a specific product which would have \u2018labelling\u2019, then the mandatory information must also be given in the \u2018advertising\u2019 and \u2018presentation\u2019 of that food.\n(c) An exemption exists in Article 1(2) of the Regulation for non-prepacked foodstuffs put up for sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers and foodstuffs packed at the point of sale at the request of the purchaser or pre-packed with a view to an immediate sale. That exemption means that the mandatory information listed in points (a) and (b) of Article 10(2) is not required. On the contrary, where appropriate, the information required under points (c) and (d) of Article 10(2) is always required.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four pieces of mandatory information\nWhile allowing certain flexibility to food business operators as regards how to express mandatory information, the Regulation foresees that the following four pieces of information must be provided when a permitted health claim is used:\n(a) \u2018A statement indicating the importance of a varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle\u2019\n(b) \u2018The quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed beneficial effect\u2019\n(c) \u2018Where appropriate, a statement addressed to persons who should avoid using the food\u2019; and\n(d) \u2018An appropriate warning for products that are likely to present a health risk if consumed to excess\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference to general, non-specific health benefits \u2013 Article 10(3)\nArticle 10(3) allows the use of easy, attractive statements which make reference to general, non-specific benefits of a food for overall good health or health-related well-being, without prior authorisation, subject to specific conditions. The use of such statements could be helpful to consumers as they would convey more consumer-friendly messages. However, they could be easily misunderstood and/or misinterpreted by consumers, possibly leading to imagine other/better health benefits of a food than those that actually exist. For this reason, when referring to general, non-specific health benefits, it is required to accompany such references by a specific health claim from the lists of permitted health claims in the Union Register. For the purposes of the Regulation, the specific authorised health claim accompanying the statement making reference to general non-specific health benefits, should be made \u2018next to\u2019 or \u2018following\u2019 such statement.\nThe specific claims from the lists of permitted health claims should bear some relevance to the general reference. As this reference becomes broader, e.g. \u2018for good health\u2019, more health claims from the permitted lists could be eligible to accompany it. Still, attention should be paid to the fact that Article 10 sets rules as regards the context in which health claims are used and given that Article 10 specifically refers to the rules of Chapters II and IV, those rules should also be taken into account if operators wish to comply with the requirement laid down in Article 10(3). Therefore, to avoid misleading consumers, food business operators have the responsibility to demonstrate the link between the reference to general, non-specific benefits of the food and the specific, accompanying, permitted health claim.\nSome claims submitted for authorisation during their scientific assessment were judged to be too general or non-specific for evaluation. These claims could not be authorised and can therefore be found in the list of the non-authorised claims of the Union Register of nutrition and health claims. This does not exclude that those claims could benefit from the provisions laid down in Article 10(3) and can therefore be lawfully used when they are accompanied by a specific claim from the list of permitted health claims in accordance with that Article.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 250, 19.9.1984, p. 17.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 18.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2006/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 concerning misleading and comparative advertising states: \u2018advertising\u2019 means the making of a representation in any form in connection with a trade, business, craft or profession in order to promote the supply of goods or services, including immovable property, rights and obligations (OJ L 376, 27.12.2006, p. 21).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0The Union Register is published on the official website of the European Commission, DG Health and Consumers http://ec.europa.eu/nuhclaims/"}
