whereas the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas;\nWhereas the Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96 (6), laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas these provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, the competent authorities of the Member States notified the Commission of the quantities of quotas assigned in 1996 and not used;\nWhereas the unused quantities could not be redistributed in time to be used before the end of the 1996 quota year;\nWhereas examination of the data received for each of the products in question indicates that the quantities not used in the 1996 quota year should be redistributed in 1997, up to a limit of the amounts set out in Annex I to this Regulation;\nWhereas, the different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94 have been considered, the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted; whereas under this method quota tranches are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants;\nWhereas this has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows;\nWhereas quantities redistributed under this Regulation should be divided using the same criteria as for the allocation of the 1997 quotas;\nWhereas the reference period used for the apportionment of the 1997 quotas, consisting of the year 1994, should again be applied to the allocation of the share set aside for traditional importers, since it continues to reflect the normal trend of trade flows for the products in question; whereas, therefore, traditional importers must prove that they imported products originating in China subject to the relevant quotas in the course of 1994;\nWhereas it is necessary to simplify the formalities to be fulfilled by traditional importers who already hold import licences issued when the 1997 Community quotas were allocated; whereas the competent administrative authorities already possess the requisite evidence of 1994 imports for all traditional importers; whereas the latter need therefore only enclose a copy of their previous licences with their new licence applications;\nWhereas measures should be taken to provide the best conditions for the allocation of that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers with a view to optimum use of quotas, particularly as examination of the data received from the competent authorities of the Member States reveals that non-traditional importers made less use of the quotas; whereas, to this end, it is appropriate to provide for that portion to be allocated in proportion to the quantities requested, on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged, and grant access only to importers who can prove that they obtained and made use of at least 80 % of an import licence for the product in question during the 1996 quota year and to importers who did not obtain an import licence for the product in question during the 1996 quota year; whereas the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should also be restricted to a set volume or value;\nWhereas for the purposes of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers;\nWhereas with a view to optimum use of quotas, licence applications for imports of footwear under quotas which refer to several CN codes must specify the quantities required for each code;\nWhereas the Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas the information about traditional importers' previous imports must be broken down by reference year and expressed in the same units as the quota in question; whereas if the quota is set in ecus, the counter-value of the currency in which previous imports are expressed must be calculated in accordance with Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (8);\nWhereas in view of the special nature of transactions concerning products subject to quota, in particular the time needed for transport, and also the need to prevent any excessive accumulation of imports, the import licences should expire on 30 November 1997;\nWhereas these measures are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the administration of quotas set up under Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down specific provisions for the redistribution in 1997 of portions of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 which were not used in the 1996 quota year.\nThe quantities not used in the 1996 quota year shall be redistributed up to the limit of the volumes or values set out in Annex I to this Regulation.\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 shall apply, subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.", "1.
