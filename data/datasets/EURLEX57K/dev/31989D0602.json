Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed ''Fat-O-Meater\" (''FOM\").\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 mm diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950 type and a photodetector (type SFH 960), having an operating distance of between 5 and 115 mm. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 60 and 120 kg\ny = 67,11 - 0,492 x1 - 0,539 x2 + 0,0726 x3 + 0,00838 x4\n(b) carcases weighing between 120,1 and 180 kg\ny = 67,18 - 0,528 x1 - 0,559 x2 + 0,123 x3 + 0,00829 x4\nwhere\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase at the level placed between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,   // x2 =   // the thickness of the back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x3 =   // the thickness of the longissimus dorsi muscle between the third and fourth last ribs, in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2, 1.2.3.4.5 // x4 =   // (   // x1 + x2 2   // )   // 2\nPART 2\nDestron PG 100 (DEST)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed ''Destron PG 100'' (''DEST\").\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 7 mm diameter containing a photodiode (type Texas SL 2018) and a photodetector (type Texas LS 608 D), having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 mm. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 60 and 120 kg\ny = 70,24 - 0,433 x1 - 0,795 x2 + 0,0413 x3 + 0,0126 x4\n(b) carcases weighing between 120,1 and 180 kg\ny = 67,12 - 0,440 x1 - 0,512 x2 + 0,0693 x3 + 0,00672 x4\nwhere\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase at the level placed between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,   // x2 =   // the thickness of the back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x3 =   // the thickness of the longissimus dorsi muscle between the third and fourth last ribs in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2,  1.2.3.4.5 // x4 =   // (   // x1 + x2 2   // )   // 2\nPART 3\nIntrascope (Optical Probe)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed ''Intrascope (Optical Probe)\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexaganol shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 mm (and of 19 mm at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres and having an operating distance of between 8 and 50 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 60 and 120 kg\ny = 68,14 - 0,517 x1 - 0,425 x2 + 0,00831 x3\n(b) carcases weighing between 120,1 and 180 kg\ny = 72,82 - 0,573 x1 - 0,464 x2 + 0,00758 x3\nwhere\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x2 =  // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at the level of the gluteus medius muscle, 1.2.3.4.5 // x3 =   // (   // x1 + x2 2   // )   // 2'"}
