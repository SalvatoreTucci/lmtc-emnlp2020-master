Before the beginning of each marketing year, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine the maximum guaranteed quantity. Such quantity, which shall be fixed in the light of production during a  reference period and the foreseeable trend of demand, may not exceed 752 000 tonnes of unginned cotton.\n2.  When the production of unginned cotton, estimated at the beginning of the marketing year, exceeds the maximum quantity guaranteed for the year in question, the amount of aid shall be reduced by an amount obtained by multiplying the norm price by a  coefficient which increases in line with the amount by which estimated production exceeds the maximum quantity guaranteed.\nHowever for the 1987/88, 1988/89 and 1989/90 marketing years, this reduction in the amount of aid may not be greater than 15 %, 20 % and 25 % respectively of the norm price.\nWhere the first subparagraph, when applied to the actual production instead of to the production estimated prior to the beginning of the marketing year, would result in a reduction in the amount of aid different from that which has been granted, the  maximum quantity guaranteed for the following marketing year shall be adjusted to allow for this situation.\n3.  The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the rules for the determination of the coefficient referred to in paragraph 2.", "1.
