whereas the quota volumes are as follows:\n- 1 300 tonnes for beans (Phaseolus spp.) falling within CN codes ex 0708 20 10 or ex 0708 20 90 - 8 000 tonnes for onions falling within CN codes 0703 10 11 or 0703 10 19,\nand - 16 605 tonnes for sweet peppers falling within CN code 0709 60 10.\nWhereas for 1989, the duties applicable within the limits of those tariff quotas are equal to 50 % of the basic duties; whereas, however, the products concerned qualify for exemption from import duties on import into that part of Spain which is included in the customs territory of the Community; whereas, where the said products are imported into Portugal, the quota duties applicable are to be calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act of Accession; whereas  to qualify for the tariff quota the products in question must comply with certain marking and labelling conditions designed to prove their origin;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are  exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, allocation of the Community tariff quotas among the Member States would seem such as to preserve the Community nature of the quotas; whereas in order to correspond as closely as possible to the real  trend of the market for the products concerned the allocation should reflect the requirements of the Member States based on statistics of imports of those products originating in the Canary Islands during a representative reference period and on the economic outlook for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, for 1989, it is necessary to maintain the shares for the Member States given that the administrations of the Member States cannot create, by 1989, a technical and administrative basis for Community administration of the quota; whereas, however,  it is possible, given the evolution of trade over the last few years, to provide for an increase in the Community reserve;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports of these products into each of the Member States were as follows:\n(tonnes) Member State ex 0708 20 10, ex 0708 20 90 Beans (Phaseolus spp.) 0703 10 11, 0703 10 19 Onions 0709 60 10 Sweet peppers 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 Benelux 720 674 526  1 000   120    47 13 054 8 263 6 887 Denmark   2 - -     61 - -  1 086    72    31 Germany  62  54  10    566   289    56  5 758   254   155 Greece - - - - - - - - - Spain 627 - 100 14 026 - 1 851    151 -    13 (;) OJ No L 133, 22. 5. 1987, p. 5.\n(tonnes) Member State ex 0708 20 10, ex 0708 20 90 Beans (Vigna spp., Phaseolus spp.) 0703 10 11, 0703 10 19 Onions 0709 60 10 Sweet peppers 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 France - - -     45    17 -     46     1    21 Ireland - - - - -     2 -     1     2 Italy - - - - - - - - - Portugal - - - - - - - - - United Kingdom 458 445 273  1 067 1 006 -  7 284 8 903 8 912 Whereas during the last three years these products were imported regularly only by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should  be allocated only to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports actually take place in the latter; whereas these allocation arrangements will ensure the  uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;\nWhereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, each quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any  subsequent requirements of those Member States which have used up their initial shares and any requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, an appropriate level for the first part of the Community quotas would, in the present circumstances, be 60 % of each quota volume;\nWhereas if, during the quota period, the Community reserve is almost totally used up, it is vital that Member States should return to that reserve all the unused part of their initial quota and where relevant, additional shares, to prevent part of the Community tariff quota remaining unused in a Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated  to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
