However, the situation should be reviewed in the light of the information supplied by the competent authorities and the effect of the measures taken to control the disease.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Member States shall prohibit the temporary admission, transits and imports of registered horses coming from South Africa.", "Member States shall amend the measures they apply with regard to temporary admission, imports and transits of registered horses from South Africa to bring them into line with this Decision.
