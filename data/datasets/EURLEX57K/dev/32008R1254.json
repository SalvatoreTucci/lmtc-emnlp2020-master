Detailed rules for the implementation of those requirements should be laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008\u00a0(2).\n(2) Since provisions for the production of organic yeast should be introduced, the scope of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 should now also encompass yeasts used as food and feed.\n(3) With a view to help organic farmers to find adequate feed supply for their animals and to facilitate conversion of organic area, in order to meet rising consumer demand for organic products, it is appropriate to allow the use of up to 100\u00a0% in-conversion feedingstuffs, produced on the farmers\u2019 own holding, in the feed ration of organic animals.\n(4) According to Annex VI(B) to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91\u00a0(3) only enzymes normally used as processing aids were allowed to be used in organic processing, enzymes used as food additives would have to be in the list of authorised food additives of Annex VI(A)(A.1) to that Regulation. It is necessary to re-introduce this provision in the new implementing rules.\n(5) Since yeast is not considered as an agricultural product within the meaning of Article 32(3) of the Treaty and in order to allow the labelling of organic yeast as organic, it is necessary to amend the provision on the calculation of ingredients. However, the calculation of yeast and yeast products as agricultural ingredients will be obligatory as of 31 December 2013. This time period is necessary for the industry to be able to adjust.\n(6) The decorative colouring of boiled eggs is traditional in certain regions of the European Union at a certain period of the year, and as organic eggs may also be coloured and placed on the market, certain Member States lodged a request to allow colours for this purpose, a panel of independent experts was examining certain colours and different other substances for disinfecting and conserving the boiled eggs\u00a0(4) and concluded that a number of natural colours could be authorised, as well as synthetic forms of iron oxides and iron hydroxides on a temporary basis. Given the local and seasonal character of the production it is however appropriate to give to competent authorities the capacity to give relevant authorisations.\n(7) As recommended by a panel for organic yeast\u00a0(5) several products and substances that are necessary for the production of organic yeast, yeast confections and formulations should be authorised under Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Article 20 of that Regulation provides that only organically produced substrates are to be used for the production of organic yeast and organic yeast should not be present in organic food or feed together with non-organic yeast. However, the panel of experts has in its conclusions of 10 July 2008 recommended temporarily allowing 5\u00a0% non-organic yeast extract, until organic yeast extract is available, as additional substrate for the production of organic yeast as a source of nitrogen, phosphor, vitamins and minerals. In accordance to the flexibility rules under Article 22(2)(e) of that Regulation 5\u00a0% non-organic yeast extract should be authorised for the production of organic yeast.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The amendments should apply from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee on Organic Production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.
