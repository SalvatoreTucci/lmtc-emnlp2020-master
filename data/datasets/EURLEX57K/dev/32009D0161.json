These amendments are to be accepted unless a Contracting Party objects within 12 months of the communication by the United Nations of the proposed amendment to the Contracting Parties.\n(3) The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) Inland Transport Committee decided at its February 1999 session that the Convention should be revised to include provisions to facilitate the border crossing of vehicles.\n(4) The UN/ECE Working Party on Customs Questions affecting Transport subsequently produced draft proposals to add a new Annex 8 to the Convention in order to complement the existing provisions.\n(5) That Annex was adopted by the Administrative Committee for the Convention in October\u00a02007 and as no objections were raised, the Annex took effect from 20 May 2008.\n(6) The purpose of Annex 8 to the Convention is to facilitate international trade by reducing, harmonising and coordinating procedures and paperwork in connection with the border control of goods, in particular live animals and perishable goods. Annex 8 also aims at improving the operation of border crossing points, as well as technical matters relating to the mutual recognition of international vehicle inspection and weight certificates.\n(7) The facilitation of international trade and the removal of technical obstacles to trade is an objective of the common commercial policy and thus falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.\n(8) The Community position concerning the proposed amendment of the Convention was approved on July 2005.\n(9) Therefore, the amendment to the Convention should be approved,", "main_body": ["Annex 8 to the International Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods is hereby approved on behalf of the Community.\nThe text of that Annex is attached to this Decision.", "This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 September 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.

The objective of the International Vehicle Weight Certificate (IVWC) is to facilitate border crossing procedures and, in particular, to avoid repetitive weight measurements of goods road vehicles en route in the Contracting Parties. Duly filled-in certificates, accepted by the Contracting Parties, shall be accepted as bearing valid weight measurements by the competent authorities of Contracting Parties. Competent authorities shall refrain from requiring additional weight measurements apart from random checks and controls in the case of supposed irregularities.\n2. The International Vehicle Weight Certificate, which shall conform to the model reproduced below in this Appendix, shall be issued and used under the supervision of a designated Governmental authority in each Contracting Party accepting such certificates in line with the procedure described in the annexed certificate.\n3. The use of the certificate by transport operators is optional.\n4. The Contracting Parties, accepting such certificates, shall approve authorised weighing stations to fill in, together with the operator/driver of the goods road vehicle, the International Vehicle Weight Certificate in accordance with the following minimum requirements:\n(a) Weighing stations shall be equipped with certified weighing instruments. For performing the weight measurements, the Contracting Parties accepting such certificates may select the method and instruments they consider appropriate. The Contracting Party accepting such certificates shall ensure the competence of the weighing stations by, for example, an accreditation or assessment process and shall ensure to use of appropriate weighing instruments, the deployment of qualified personnel, and the existence of properly documented quality control systems and testing procedures.\n(b) The weighing stations and their instruments shall be well maintained. The instruments shall be regularly verified and sealed by the relevant authorities responsible for weights and measures. The weighing instruments, their maximum permissible errors and usage shall comply with the Recommendations established by the International Organisation for Legal Metrology (OIML).\n(c) Weighing stations shall be equipped with weighing instruments corresponding to either:\n\u2014 OIML Recommendation R 76 \u2018Non-automatic weighing instruments\u2019 accuracy Class III or better,\n\u2014 OIML Recommendation R 134 \u2018Automatic instruments for weighing road\u00a0vehicles in motion\u2019, accuracy Classes 2, or better, higher error values may apply in case of individual axle weight measurements.\n5. In exceptional cases and, particularly when irregularities are suspected, or at the demand of the transport operator/driver of the respective road vehicle, the competent authorities may re-weigh the vehicle. In case a weighing station produces several mistaken measurements, observed by the control authorities in a Contracting Party accepting such certificates, the competent authorities of the country of the weighing station shall take appropriate measures in order to ensure that such events will not occur again.\n6. The model of the certificate may be reproduced in any of the languages of the Contracting\u00a0Parties accepting such certificates provided that the layout of the certificate and the placing of the items therein are not modified.\n7. Each Contracting Party accepting such certificates, shall publish a list of all weighing stations in their countries authorised in accordance with international principles as well as any modifications thereto. This list as well as any modification thereto shall be transmitted to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United\u00a0Nations (UNECE) for distribution to each Contracting Party and to the international organisations referred to in Annex 7, Article 2 to this Convention.\n8. (Transitional provision) Since only very few weighing stations are equipped at present with weighing instruments able to provide individual axle weight or axle group measurements, the Contracting Parties, accepting such certificates agree that, during a transitional period, expiring 12 months following the entry into force of this Annex, gross vehicle weight measurements as provided for under item 7.3 in the International Vehicle Weight Certificate shall be sufficient and shall be accepted by the competent national authorities.\nATTACHMENT\nto the INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE WEIGHT CERTIFICATE (IVWC)\nSketches of types of goods road vehicles as required under item 7.1 of the IVWC\nNo Goods road vehicles Vehicle Type Distance between axles (m)\n\u00a0(1)\nRIGID VEHICLES\n1  A2 D < 4.0\n2  A2* D \u2265 4.0\n3  A3\n4  A4\n5  A3*\n6  A4*\n7  A5\nCOMBINATION OF VEHICLES\n1  A2 T2\n2  A2 T3\n3  A3 T2\n4  A3 T3\n5  A3 T3*\n6  A2 C2\n7  A2 C3\n8  A3 C2\n9  A3 C3\n10  A2 C1\n11  A3 C1\nARTICULATED VEHICLES\n1 with 3 axles  A2 S1\n2 with 4 axles (single or tandem)  A2 S2 D \u2264 2.0\nA2 S2* D > 2.0\nA3 S1\n3 With 5 or 6 axles (single, tandem, triple)  A2 S3\nA2 S3*\nA2 S3**\nA3 S2 D \u2264 2.0\nA3 S2* D > 2.0\nA3 S3\nA3 S3*\nA3 S3**\nWithout sketch An Sn\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0No specification is given if not relevant"}
