On 13 April 2007, taking into account this statement, EFSA indicated that the therapeutic effect of the antibiotics at stake will not be compromised by the presence of the nptII gene in GM plants. This is due to the extremely low probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria and its subsequent expression and to the fact that this antibiotic resistant gene in bacteria is already widespread in the environment. It thus confirmed its previous assessment of the safe use of the antibiotic resistance marker gene nptII in genetically modified organisms and their derived products for food and feed uses.\n(11) On 14 May 2008, the Commission sent a mandate to EFSA, with a request: (i) to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion taking into account the previous opinion and the statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market and their possible uses for import and processing and for cultivation; (ii) to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing ARM genes. The mandate brought to the attention of EFSA, inter alia, letters by the Commission from Denmark and Greenpeace.\n(12) On 11 June 2009, EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes that the previous assessment of EFSA on Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement, and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion.\n(13) A unique identifier should be assigned to the Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(4).\n(14) The proposed labelling, on a label or in an accompanying document, of products containing or consisting of Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 should include wording to inform operators and final users that such material cannot be used for human or animal consumption.\n(15) Feed produced from Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 as well as the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of the potato in food and other feed products have been authorised under Commission Decision 2010/136/EU\u00a0(5) under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(16) Member States should utilise the registers established, in accordance with Article 31(3)(b) of Directive 2001/18/EC, for recording the location of GMOs grown under Part C of the Directive, inter alia, to facilitate monitoring and general surveillance and for the purpose of inspection and control.\n(17) In view of the opinion of EFSA, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.\n(18) In order to complement existing field studies carried out in northern Europe, which indicated that the cultivation of Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 is unlikely to have adverse effects on the environment, additional measures to monitor potato-feeding organisms in the fields and their vicinity where Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 is commercially cultivated should be put in place as part of the monitoring programme.\n(19) Prior to the placing on the market of the Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1, the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market, including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should be applicable.\n(20) A detection method for the Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1 has been validated by the Community Reference Laboratory as referred to in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 641/2004 of 6 April 2004 on detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the application for the authorisation of new genetically modified food and feed, the notification of existing products and adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified material which has benefited from a favourable risk evaluation\u00a0(6).\n(21) The Committee established under Article 30(1) of Directive 2001/18/EC has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit laid down by its Chairman.\n(22) At its meeting on 16 July 2007, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,", "main_body": ["Consent\nWithout prejudice to other Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, written consent shall be granted by the competent authority of Sweden to the placing on the market, in accordance with this Decision, of the product identified in Article 2, as notified (Reference C/SE/96/3501) by BASF Plant Science.\nThe consent shall, in accordance with Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions to which the consent is subject, which are set out in Articles 3 and 4.", "Product\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genetically modified organism to be placed on the market as or in products, hereinafter \u2018the product\u2019 is potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) modified for enhanced content of the amylopectin component of starch, which has been transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, using the vector pHoxwG, resulting in line EH92-527-1.
