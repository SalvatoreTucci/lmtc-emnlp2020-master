Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(3) lays down permitted maximum levels of aflatoxins in foodstuffs. However, in 2005 and 2006 an increasing number of notifications through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food (RASFF) indicated that those maximum levels have been regularly exceeded in almonds and derived products from the United States of America.\n(3) Such contamination constitutes a threat to public health in the Community. It is therefore appropriate to adopt special measures at Community level.\n(4) The Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carried out a mission in the United States of America from 11 to 15 September 2006 to assess the control systems in place to prevent aflatoxin contamination levels in almonds intended for export to the Community\u00a0(4). That mission revealed the absence of any compulsory legal requirements to control aflatoxin levels in almond production and processing and the inadequacy of the current control system to offer guarantees concerning the compliance of exported products with Community standards. Furthermore, it showed the inadequacy of the laboratories visited to provide any guarantees for exports and demonstrated failures to comply with almost all aspects of EN ISO/IEC 17025 on \u2018General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories\u2019.\n(5) In response to that FVO report, the United States of America announced its intention to undertake action to address those shortcomings. However, the proposed action is insufficient to provide guarantees for compliance of future shipments of almonds with Community legislation on aflatoxins, in particular due to the voluntary nature of the aflatoxin control system. It is therefore appropriate to subject almonds and derived products originating in or consigned from the United States of America to strict conditions in order to provide a high level of protection to public health.\n(6) In the interest of public health, all consignments of almonds and derived products imported into the Community from the United States of America should be subjected to sampling and analysis for aflatoxin levels by the competent authority of the importing Member State, prior to release onto the market insofar as they are not covered by the Voluntary Aflatoxin Sampling Plan set up by the Almond Board of California in May 2006 (VASP). The consignments covered by the VASP should be accompanied by a health certificate and made subject to random sampling and analysis at the point of import into the Community. The measures will be reviewed within one year on the basis of the reports by the Member States and additional guarantees provided by the competent authorities of the United States of America.\n(7) Decision 2006/504/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/504/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1:\n(a) the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(b) in the second paragraph:\n\u2014 the first sentence is replaced by the following:\n\u2014 the following points (f) and (g) are added:\n\u2018(f) The following foodstuffs originating in or consigned from the United States of America, which are covered by the Voluntary Aflatoxin Sampling Plan set up by the Almond Board of California in May 2006 (the Voluntary Aflatoxin Sampling Plan):\n(i) almonds in shell or shelled falling within CN code 0802\u00a011 or 0802\u00a012;\n(ii) roasted almonds falling within CN codes 2008\u00a019\u00a013 (in immediate packings of a net content exceeding 1 kg) and 2008\u00a019\u00a093 (in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 1 kg);\n(iii) mixtures of nuts or dried fruits falling within CN code 0813\u00a050 and containing almonds;\n(g) The following foodstuffs imported from the United States of America, which are not covered by the Voluntary Aflatoxin Sampling Plan:\n(i) almonds in shell or shelled falling within CN code 0802\u00a011 or 0802\u00a012;\n(ii) roasted almonds falling within CN codes 2008\u00a019\u00a013 (in immediate packings of a net content exceeding 1 kg) and 2008\u00a019\u00a093 (in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 1 kg);\n(iii) mixtures of nuts or dried fruits falling within CN code 0813\u00a050 and containing almonds.\u2019;\n2. in Article 3:\n(a) in the first paragraph, the following point (f) is added:\n\u2018(f) the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for foodstuffs from the United States of America.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraph 8 is added:\n3. in Article 5, paragraph 2, the following points (f) and (g) are added:\n\u2018(f) approximately 5\u00a0% of the consignments of foodstuffs from the United States of America, referred to in point (f) of the second paragraph of Article 1;\n(g) each consignment of foodstuffs from the United States of America, referred to in point (g) of the second paragraph of Article 1.\u2019;\n4. the following Article 7a is inserted:\n(a) have initiated and be pursuing the necessary accreditation procedures; and\n(b) provide sufficient guarantees that quality control schemes for the aflatoxin analyses it conducts are in place.\n5.
