The Agency is to pay particular attention to those areas identified as most vulnerable without prejudice to any other area in need.\n(6) The activities of the Agency in this field should not relieve coastal states of their responsibility to have appropriate pollution response mechanisms in place and should comply with existing cooperation arrangements between Member States or groups of Member States in this field. In the event of a maritime pollution incident, the Agency is to assist the Member State(s) affected, under whose authority clean-up operations are to be conducted.\n(7) In accordance with the Action Plan, the Agency is to play an active role in developing a centralised satellite imagery service for surveillance, the early detection of pollution and identification of the ships responsible. This new system will improve the availability of data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution caused by ships.\n(8) The additional means to be provided by the Agency to the Member States should be made available through the Community mechanism in the field of civil protection assistance interventions, including accidental marine pollution, established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom\u00a0(4).\n(9) In order to ensure thorough implementation of the Action Plan and strengthen the prevention of and response to pollution caused by ships by expanding current anti-pollution activities, the Agency should be provided with a viable and cost-effective system for financing, in particular, its operational assistance to the Member States.\n(10) It is therefore necessary to provide for appropriate financial security for the funding of the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of pollution response and other associated actions on the basis of a multiannual commitment. The annual amounts of the Community contribution should be determined in accordance with the procedures in force.\n(11) The amounts to be committed for the funding of pollution response should cover the period 2007 to 2013, in line with the new financial framework.\n(12) A financial envelope covering the same period should therefore be provided for the implementation of the Action Plan.\n(13) The amount of that envelope should be regarded as the minimum needed to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships.\n(14) In order to optimise the allocation of commitments and take into account any changes with regard to activities in response to pollution caused by ships, it is necessary to ensure continuous monitoring of the particular needs for action so as to allow for adaptation of the annual financial commitments.\n(15) The Administrative Board of the Agency should thus review the budgetary commitments, on the basis of a report to be produced by the Executive Director, to include any necessary adjustments to the budget of the Agency. Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Objective\nThis Regulation lays down the detailed arrangements for the financial contribution of the Community to the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the implementation of the tasks assigned to it in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships and other associated actions, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018the Agency\u2019 means the European Maritime Safety Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002;\n(b) \u2018regional agreements\u2019 means the bilateral and regional agreements concluded between coastal states to render mutual assistance in the event of a maritime pollution incident;\n(c) \u2018oil\u2019 means petroleum in any form including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and refined products as established by the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, 1990;\n(d) \u2018hazardous and noxious substances\u2019 means any substance other than oil which, if introduced into the marine environment, is likely to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea, as established by the Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances, 2000.", "Scope\nThe financial contribution of the Community referred to in Article 1 shall be allocated to the Agency with the aim of financing actions such as the ones mentioned in the Action Plan and in particular those relating to:\n(a) information and the assembling, analysing and disseminating of best practices, techniques and innovations, such as instruments for monitoring tank-emptying, in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships;\n(b) cooperation and coordination and the provision to the Member States and the Commission of technical and scientific assistance in the framework of the activities of the relevant regional agreements;\n(c) operational assistance and supporting, on request, with additional means, such as stand-by anti-pollution ships and equipment, Member States' pollution response actions in the event of accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships.", "Community funding\nThe financial envelope for the implementation of the tasks referred to in Article 3 for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 shall be EUR 154\u00a0000\u00a0000.\nAnnual appropriations shall be determined by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial framework.
