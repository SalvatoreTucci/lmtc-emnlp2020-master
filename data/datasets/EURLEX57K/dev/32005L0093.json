Finland has applied the allowance only to a limited extent and restricted the import of beer to a maximum 16 litres per person.\n(3) The accession of new Member States has provided new opportunities for people travelling from one of the Member States, especially from Estonia, who wish to bring beer into Finland. Finland reacted to this situation by reducing tax rates on alcoholic beverages across the board by, on average, 33\u00a0%, which is by far the most significant change for 40 years.\n(4) The reduction in alcohol tax rates has led not only to significant losses of excise duty revenue but also to increased problems in relation to alcohol policy and to social and health policy. Furthermore, problems in public order and an increase in alcohol-related crime have arisen.\n(5) Finland has requested a derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 69/169/EEC to apply a maximum limit for beer imports by travellers from third countries of not less than 16 litres per person.\n(6) Account should be taken of the geographical situation of Finland, the economic difficulties of the Finnish retail traders located in the border regions and the considerable loss of revenue caused by the increased imports of beer from third countries.\n(7) For those reasons and in the light of the current reflections on a general revision of the values and quantities of goods set out in Directive 69/169/EEC, it is appropriate to authorise Finland to apply the requested derogation for a further period until 31 December 2007,", "main_body": ["Article 5(9) of Directive 69/169/EEC shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20189.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 4(1), Finland shall be authorised, until 31 December 2007, to apply a maximum quantitative limit of not less than 16 litres for the importation of beer from third countries.\u2019", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2005.
