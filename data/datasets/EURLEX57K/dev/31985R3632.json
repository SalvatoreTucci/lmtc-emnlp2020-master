The option of making the declaration referred to in paragraph 1 (c) may be exercised only if the Member States have so provided.\n3. Where a Member State authorizes the declaration to be made referred to in paragraph 1 (c), the right\n(a) either to make declarations in the name and on behalf of another person,\n(b) or to make declarations in their own name but on behalf of another person,\nmay be limited by that State to persons pursuing the activity of making customs declarations on a self-employed basis, either as their principal occupation or as a secondary activity related to another occupation.\n4. Where the acceptance of a customs declaration involves particular obligations on the part of a specific person, the declaration may be made only in the name of the said person or on his behalf.\nMember States may stipulate that, when made in writing, a declaration:\n- of personal property imported on the occasion of a transfer of residence or an inheritance,\n- of unaccompanied personal baggage of a non-commercial nature\nmay be made only in the name and on behalf of the person concerned.\n5.
