PROCEDURE\n(1)  In November 1992, the Commission announced by a notice published in the  Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding  concerning imports into the Community of colour television receivers (hereinafter referred to as  CTVs) exported from or originating in Malaysia, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of  Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Turkey and commenced an investigation.\nThe proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged by the Society for Coherent  Anti-dumping Norms (SCAN), on behalf of producers whose collective output of CTVs was alleged to  represent a major proportion of the Community production of these televisions.\nThe complaint contained evidence of dumping of this product originating in or exported from the  countries indicated above, and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered  sufficient to justify the opening of a proceeding in respect of those countries.\n(2)  The Commission officially notified the producers, exporters and importers known to be  concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries, and the complainant, and gave the  parties concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.\n(3)  The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992.\n(4)  Several parties including the Turkish authorities made their views known in writing and those  so requesting were granted a hearing.\n(5)  The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the preliminary  determination of dumping and injury.\nB.  PROVISIONAL DETERMINATION IN RESPECT OF TURKEY\n(6)  By Regulation (EC) No 2376/94  (1) the  Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of CTVs  originating in all the above countries with the exception of Turkey. At that stage it was  provisionally included that there were insufficient elements to impose provisional measures against  Turkey. The reasons for this conclusion were set out in recitals 31, 93, 98, 99 and 139 of the  abovementioned Regulation.\nC.  SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE\n(7)  No new evidence nor arguments have been brought forward which would  warrant a change in the Commission's position since the imposition of provisional measures.\nD.  TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING IN RESPECT OF TURKEY\n(8)  Accordingly, the Commission considers  that termination of the proceeding in respect of imports of CTVs originating in Turkey is  warranted.\n(9)  The complainants and other interested parties concerned were informed of the Commission's  intention to terminate the proceeding with regard to imports of CTVs originating in Turkey, and did  not dispute this course of action.\n(10)  No objections were raised in the Advisory Committee to the termination of the proceeding in  respect of imports of CTVs originating in Turkey,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding in respect of imports of colour  television receivers originating in Turkey falling within CN codes ex  8528  10  52, 8528  10  54,  8528  10  56, 8528  10  58, ex  8528  10  62, 8528  10  66, 8528  10  72 and 8528  10  76 is hereby  terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 1995.\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President"}
