Commission Decision 2007/560/EC\u00a0(8) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.\n(9) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods of up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the conditions relating to the detailed assessment of the active substances and the plant protection products in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.\n(10) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the respective draft assessment reports to the Commission on 16 December 2009 (bixafen), on 5 February 2008 (Candida oleophila strain O), on 30 August 2011 (fluopyram), on 30 March 2008 (halosulfuron), on 27 July 2007 (potassium iodide and potassium thiocyanate) and on 29 April 2008 (spirotetramat).\n(11) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the time-frame provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC, read in conjunction with Commission Decisions 2010/457/EU\u00a0(9) (Candida oleophila strain O, potassium iodide and potassium thiocyanate) and 2010/671/EU\u00a0(10) (spirotetramat).\n(12) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on a possible approval in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 for bixafen, Candida oleophila strain O, fluopyram, halosulfuron, potassium iodide, potassium thiocyanate and spirotetramat will have been completed within 24 months.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Member States may extend provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing bixafen, Candida oleophila strain O, fluopyram, halosulfuron, potassium iodide, potassium thiocyanate or spirotetramat for a period ending on 31 July 2014 at the latest.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 July 2014.\nArticle3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 240, 11.9.2009, p. 32.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 141, 2.6.2007, p. 78.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 151, 16.6.2009, p. 37.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 236, 31.8.2006, p. 31.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 282, 26.10.2005, p. 18.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 213, 15.8.2007, p. 29.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 218, 19.8.2010, p. 24.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 290, 6.11.2010, p. 49."}
