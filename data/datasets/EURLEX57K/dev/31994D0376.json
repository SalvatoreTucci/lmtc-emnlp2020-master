In part C, section I, (Codes regrouping several characteristics included in the 1985 and 1987 structure surveys),\n- in code P1, the words 'non-fodder' are deleted in the I01 (successive secondary non-fodder crops) characteristics,\nand\n- in code P1, the words '+ I06a (fallow land, with rotation possibilities) + 106b (permanent pasture and meadow used as grazing for extensive livestock farmers) + 106c (lentils, chick pass and vetches)' are added.\n3.
