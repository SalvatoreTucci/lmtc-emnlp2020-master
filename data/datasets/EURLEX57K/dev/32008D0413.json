In that report it came to the conclusion that alpha-cyclodextrin is safe for human consumption.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 28\u00a0September 2005.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) Therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 28\u00a0October 2006.\n(6) On 6\u00a0July 2007 EFSA adopted the \u2018Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to the safety of alpha-cyclodextrin\u2019.\n(7) In the opinion the panel came to the conclusion that there are no safety concerns at the proposed use levels and anticipated consumption of alpha-cyclodextrin.\n(8) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that alpha-cyclodextrin complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0258/97.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Alpha-cyclodextrin as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient.", "The designation \u2018alpha-cyclodextrin\u2019 or \u2018\u03b1-cyclodextrin\u2019 shall be displayed in the list of ingredients of the foods containing it.", "This Decision is addressed to Wacker, Consortium f\u00fcr elektrochemische Chemie GmbH, Zielstattstrasse 20, D-81379 M\u00fcnchen."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.

Recovery and purification of \u03b1-cyclodextrin may be carried out using one of the following procedures: precipitation of a complex of \u03b1-cyclodextrin with 1-decanol, dissolution in water at elevated temperature and re-precipitation, steam-stripping of the complexant, and crystallisation of \u03b1-cyclodextrin from the solution; or chromatography with ion-exchange or gel filtration followed by crystallisation of \u03b1-cyclodextrin from the purified mother liquor; or membrane separation methods such as ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis.\nChemical name\nCyclohexaamylose\nCAS. number\n10016-20-3\nChemical formula\n(C6H10O5)6\nStructural formula\nFormula weight\n972,85\nAssay\nNot less than 98\u00a0% (dry basis)\nDescription\nVirtually odorless, white or almost white crystalline solid.\nCharacteristics\nIdentification\nMelting range Decomposes above 278 \u00b0C\nSolubility Freely soluble in water; very slightly soluble in ethanol\nSpecific rotation [\u03b1]D\n25: Between +145\u00b0 and +151\u00b0 (1\u00a0% solution)\nChromatography The retention time for the major peak in a liquid chromatogram of the sample corresponds to that for \u03b1-cyclodextrin in a chromatogram of reference \u03b1-cyclodextrin (available from Consortium f\u00fcr Elektrochemische Industrie GmbH, M\u00fcnchen, Germany or Wacker Biochem Group, Adrian, MI, USA) using the conditions described in the METHOD OF ASSAY\nPurity\nWater Not more than 11\u00a0% (Karl Fischer Method)\nResidual complexant Not more than 20 mg/kg\n(1-decanol)\nReducing substances Not more than 0,5\u00a0% (as glucose)\nSulfated ash Not more than 0,1\u00a0%\nLead Not more than 0,5 mg/kg\nMethod of assay\nDetermine by liquid chromatography using the following conditions:\nSample solution: Weigh accurately about 100 mg of test sample into a 10-ml volumetric flask and add 8 ml of deionised water. Dissolve the sample completely using an ultra-sonification bath (10-15 min) and dilute to the mark with purified deionised water. Filter through a 0,45-micrometer filter.\nReference solution: Weigh accurately about 100 mg of \u03b1-cyclodextrin into a 10-ml volumetric flask and add 8 ml of deionised water. Dissolve the sample completely using an ultra-sonification bath and dilute to the mark with purified deionised water.\nChromatography: Liquid chromatograph equipped with a refractive index detector and an integrating recorder.\nColumn and packing: Nucleosil-100-NH2 (10 \u03bcm) (Macherey & Nagel Co.

Calculate the percentage of \u03b1-cyclodextrin in the test sample as follows:\n% \u03b1-cyclodextrin (dry basis) = 100 \u00d7 (AS/AR) (WR/WS)\nwhere\nAs and AR are the areas of the peaks due to \u03b1-cyclodextrin for the sample solution and reference solution, respectively.\nWs and WR are the weights (mg) of the test sample and reference \u03b1-cyclodextrin, respectively, after correcting for water content."}
