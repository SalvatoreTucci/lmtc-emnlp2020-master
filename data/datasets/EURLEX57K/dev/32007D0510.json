Grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cAutofom\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with sixteen 2 MHz ultrasonic transducers (SFK Technology, K2KG), with an operating distance between transducers of 25 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of carcasses shall be calculated on the basis of 23 measuring points according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = 69,4808 \u2013 0,09178*X0 \u2013 0,08778*X7 \u2013 0,02047*X9 \u2013 0,06525*X19 \u2013 0,03135*X21 \u2013 0,01352*X26 \u2013 0,01257*X29 + 0,00660*X31 + 0,00726*X36 \u2013 0,11207*X48 \u2013 0,31733*X60 \u2013 0,12530*X64 \u2013 0,03016*X83 \u2013 0,28903*X88 \u2013 0,15229*X91 \u2013 0,03713*X92 + 0,09666*X100 \u2013 0,08611*X101 + 0,01797*X113 + 0,03736*X115 + 0,03356*X116 + 0,01313*X121 + 0,01547*X123\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\n4.

Grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cUltraFom 300\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a 3,5 MHz ultrasound probe (SFK Technology 3,5 64LA), 5 cm in length, featuring 64 ultrasound transducers. The ultrasound signal shall be digitalised, recorded and analysed by a microprocessor.\n3. The lean meat content of carcasses shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nG = the thickness of the fat (including rind) between the second and third last ribs, at 7 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to the rind (in millimetres),\nM = the thickness of the muscle between the second and third last ribs, at 7 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to the rind (in millimetres)."}
