All operators must keep at the INAO\u2019s disposal their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production:\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese must be manufactured in the geographical area. The cheese is matured in caves in the Causses in the geographical area delineated by the municipalities of Campagnac, Cornus, Millau, Peyreleau, Sainte-Affrique (Aveyron), Tr\u00e8ves (Gard) and P\u00e9gairolles-de-l\u2019Escalette (H\u00e9rault).\nBleu des Causses is produced according to tradition: whole milk, generally incorporated raw, is hot-curdled (30\u00a0\u00b0C), and the curd is cut and stirred in moulds pierced with holes. After being injected with penicillium, the drained, salted and brushed cheese is pricked with needles in order to enable the penicillium to develop under the effect of the fresh air in the cave. Maturing lasts between three and six months (minimum of 70 days).\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link:\nBleu des Causses originates as long ago as Roquefort. The caussenard farmers used to put cows milk cheese in natural cavities in limestone scree exposed to the North and subjected to damp fresh air. First called Bleu de l\u2019Aveyron, this cheese was defined by decree in 1937 and then, under the name Bleu des Causses, obtained designation of origin status by judgment of the court of Millau in 1953, which was confirmed by the decree of 21 May 1979.\nThe typical characteristics of Bleu des Causses are closely linked to the terrain of the Causses (rocky, dry limestone plateaux) and the specific features of its slow maturing process in natural caves, generally in karstic cavities in which damp, fresh air circulates.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body:\nName : Institut National de l\u2019Origine et de la Qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress : 51, Rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris\nTel. : +33 (0)1 53 89 80 00\nFax : +33 (0)1 53 89 80 60\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut National de l\u2019Origine et de la Qualit\u00e9 is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName : Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R\u00e9pression des Fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress : 59, Boulevard Vincent Auriol 75703 PARIS C\u00e9dex 13\nTel. : + 33 (0)1 44 87 17 17\nFax : + 33 (0)1 44 97 30 37\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling:\n\u2014"}
