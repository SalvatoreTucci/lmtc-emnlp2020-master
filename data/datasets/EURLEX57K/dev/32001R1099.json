The finalisation and adoption of those implementing measures will not be completed by 31 May 2001. Certain Council provisions repealed by Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should accordingly be allowed to stand for a short additional period.\n(2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.\n(3) Less progress has been made in adopting implementing measures in certain areas than in others, for example regarding the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine products, because of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues the Council has to deal with and the direct impact of any measures adopted on operators in the Community and in non-member countries. Provision should therefore be made for an extra transitional period in order to allow in-depth discussions to be held.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1608/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
