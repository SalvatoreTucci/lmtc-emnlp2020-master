The authorisation is linked to the holder of the authorisation. In all cases the holder of the authorisation is BASF Aktiengesellschaft.\n(3) The applicant claims that BASF Aktiengesellschaft was converted into BASF SE with effect from 14 January 2008 and that BASF SE is the same enterprise and now owns the marketing rights for those additives. The applicant has submitted appropriate documents supporting its claims.\n(4) The proposed change of the terms of the authorisations is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additives concerned. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(5) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the name of BASF SE from 14 January 2008, it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisations with effect from that date.\n(6) Regulations (EC) No 1200/2005, (EC) No 184/2007, (EC) No 243/2007, (EC) No 1142/2007, (EC) No 1380/2007 and (EC) No 165/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005, in column 2 of the entry for 1, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 184/2007, in column 2 of the entry for 4d800, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 243/2007, in column 2 of the entry for 4a1600, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1142/2007, in column 2 of the entry for 4a1600, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1380/2007, in column 2 of the entry for 4a62, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 165/2008, in column 2 of the entry for 4a1600, the words \u2018BASF Aktiengesellschaft\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018BASF SE\u2019.", "Existing stocks which are in conformity with the provisions applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation may continue to be placed on the market and used until 31 October 2008.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 14 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
