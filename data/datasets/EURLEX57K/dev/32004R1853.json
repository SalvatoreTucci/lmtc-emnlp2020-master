In view of the continuing severe and systematic violations of human rights by the Burmese authorities, and in particular the continuing and intensified repression of civil and political rights, and the failure of those authorities to take steps towards democracy and reconciliation, the restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar have subsequently been extended several times, most recently by Common Position 2004/423/CFSP\u00a0(3). Some of the restrictive measures imposed against Burma/Myanmar have been implemented at Community level by Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2004 of 26 April 2004 renewing the restrictive measures in respect of Burma/Myanmar and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1081/2000\u00a0(4).\n(2) In view of the current political situation in Burma/Myanmar, as witnessed by the failure of the military authorities to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) as well as other political detainees, and the failure to allow a genuine and open National Convention, and in view of the the continued harassment of the NLD and other organised political movements, Common Position 2004/730/CFSP maintains and strengthens the restrictive measures imposed in respect of Burma/Myanmar by Common Position 2004/423/CFSP to include, inter alia, a prohibition on making financial loans or credits available to, and on acquiring or extending a participation in, Burmese state-owned enterprises; while such prohibition should not affect the execution of related obligations resulting from existing contracts or agreements, the conclusion of new contracts or agreements on the subject-matter of this Regulation or the renewal of existing contracts or agreements after their expiration should be prohibited after the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(3) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement them as far as the Community is concerned.\n(4) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 798/2004 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 798/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n(a) the granting of any financial loan or credit to Burmese state-owned enterprises as listed in Annex IV, or the acquisition of bonds, certificates of deposit, warrants or debentures, issued by these enterprises,\n(b) the acquisition or extension of a participation in Burmese state-owned enterprises as listed in Annex IV, including the acquisition in full of such enterprises and the acquisition of shares and securities of a participating nature.\n2. Article 12 shall be replaced by the following:\n(a) amend Annex II on the basis of information supplied by Member States,\n(b) amend Annexes III and IV on the basis of decisions taken in respect of Annexes I and II to Common Position 2004/423/CFSP as amended by Common Position 2004/730/CFSP.\u00a0(5)\n3.
