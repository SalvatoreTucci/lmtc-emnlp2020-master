whereas the provisions making use of the inward processing relief arrangements in trade with third countries subject to the requirement that the arrangements about the best conditions for export of processed goods are consequently not justified for trade between Member States; whereas use of inward processing relief arrangements in trade between Member States must therefore always be deemed to contribute in the Member State of processing towards providing the most favourable conditions for export of the products resulting from such processing without conflicting with essential interests of Community producers; whereas, moreover, Council Regulation (EEC) No 866/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down special measures concerning the exclusion of milk products from inward processing arrangements and from certain usual forms of handling (5) must not be applied to inward processing relief arrangements carried out in trade between Member States;\nWhereas the rules for discharge of inward processing relief arrangements must be extended to include the use of T2 ES and T2 PT documents and documents having the same effect;\nWhereas for the reasons given in connection with the inward processing arrangements, the economic conditions referred to in Article 4 (g) of Regulation (EEC) No 2763/83 should likewise be deemed to be fulfilled where the arrangements for processing under customs control are used for trade within the Community;\nWhereas Article 10 (4) of Directive 76/119/EEC already provides that where goods are exported from one Member State for outward processing and reimported in the form of compensating products into another Member State, that the amount of import duties to be deducted pursuant to Article 10 (1) of the Directive shall be reduced, if necessary, by the amount of import duties which would be applicable if the goods were traded directly between the two Member States;\nWhereas the requirement that Community goods be treated equally, regardless of the Member State from which they come, means that in trade between Member State, the outward processing relief arrangements must always be deemed not likely to cause serious damage to the essential interests of Community processors;\nWhereas the provisions of this Regulation shall, if necessary, be adapted to take account of the application from 1 January 1987 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1999/85 of 16 July 1985 on inward processing relief arrangements (1),", "main_body": ["I.
