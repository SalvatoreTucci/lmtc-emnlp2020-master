This epidemic has led to a crisis of confidence among consumers which has led to a substantial drop in consumption. Consumer confidence in fresh fruit and vegetable products produced in the EU should therefore be strengthened.\n(4) This crisis of confidence has also led to acute economic difficulties, such that the economic survival of a significant number of farms in the EU fresh fruit and vegetable sector is in jeopardy. The opportunities for exporting fresh fruit and vegetable products produced in the EU to third countries should therefore be increased.\n(5) In this context it is appropriate to offer trade organisations representing the fresh fruit and vegetable sector the opportunity to benefit from EU part-financing under Regulation (EC) No 3/2008, and to that end they should be allowed to submit information and promotion programmes to the competent national authorities within the next few weeks, with a view to their selection and possible adoption by the Commission before the end of this year. These programmes may be submitted independently of the annual timing for adopting programmes and the usual timetable laid down in Articles 8 and 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 of 5 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries\u00a0(2).\n(6) There is therefore reason to derogate, for 2011, for information and promotion programmes for fresh fruit and vegetables on the internal market and in third countries, from Regulation (EC) No 501/2008.\n(7) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not issued an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["For 2011 and notwithstanding the usual annual timetable provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 8(1) and in Article 11(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 501/2008, the following additional timetable shall be applied for information and promotion programmes for fresh fruit and vegetables on the internal market and in third countries:\n(a) the trade and inter-branch organisations representing the fresh fruit and vegetable sector may submit their programmes to the Member States by 16 August 2011;\n(b) Member States shall notify the Commission of the provisional list of the programmes selected by 15 September 2011;\n(c) the Commission shall decide which programmes it can part-finance by 15 November 2011 at the latest.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a03, 5.1.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0147, 6.6.2008, p.\u00a03."}
