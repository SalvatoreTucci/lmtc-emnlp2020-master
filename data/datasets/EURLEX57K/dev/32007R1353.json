On the basis of the recommendation of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use, this substance should be added in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine species (muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk).\n(3) The substance Lasalocid is currently included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for poultry for muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney and in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for poultry from which eggs are produced for human consumption, awaiting validation of analytical method. Those scientific studies have been now completed and the analytical method has been validated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use. Lasalocid belongs to the group of antibiotic ionophores having anticoccidial properties. Consequently, Lasalocid should be added in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for poultry from which eggs are produced for human consumption, under the new point 1.2.16, while the Lasalocid entry under point 2.4.4 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02377/90 should be deleted.\n(4) The substance Acetylisovaleryltylosin, an antibiotic belonging to the group of macrolides is currently included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for porcine and poultry species. A change to the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) of this active substance has been notified to the European Medicines Agency. The substance\u2019s name Acetylisovaleryltylosin should be replaced by the new INN, Tylvalosin.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 20 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.
