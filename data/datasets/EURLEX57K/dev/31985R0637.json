Definitive action\n(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 706/84 (2) imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of tube and pipe fittings of malleable cast iron originating in Spain.\nB. Subsequent procedure\n(2) In August 1984, after introduction of the definitive duty, the Spanish Government and the exporters requested a reduction in the rate of the duty on the ground that Government Decree No 1313/1984 of 20 June 1984, published in the Spanish official gazette (BOE No 164) of 10 July 1984, which entered into force on 11 July 1984, had modified the system of export rebates. Article 4 of the Decree provided for an across-the-board reduction of 15 % in the rate of the rebate.\nC. Subsidy\n(3) The Commission obtained the necessary information from the Spanish Government and the exporters, including particulars from the exporters of deliveries to the Community of malleable cast iron tube and pipe fittings since 11 July 1984, and of the export rebates received, which were checked on the spot. It emerged that as from 11 July 1984 the rebate for the products in question was cut by 15 % from 11,5 to 9,8 % (rounded off to the first decimal place), lowering the export subsidy as found by the Commission by 1,7 %, from 8,4 to 6,7 % of the export price.\nD. Duty\n(4) Since the Spanish Government has lowered by 1,7 % the rebate on exports of the said products, a corresponding reduction should be made in the definitive countervailing duty with effect from 11 July 1984. Under Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (3) importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid in excess of the amount due under the abovementioned Regulation on goods released for free circulation in the Community since 11 July 1984,", "main_body": ["Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 706/84 is hereby replaced by the following:\n'2.
