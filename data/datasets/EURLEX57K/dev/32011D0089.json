Many domesticated and wild animals can be carriers of the disease but cattle, goats and sheep are the main reservoirs.\n(3) In the EU, there are no harmonised rules as regards notification or control of Q fever in animals. Disease control measures are normally taken on national, regional or even farm level.\n(4) According to the EFSA opinion of 27 April 2010\u00a0(4), the overall impact of Q fever on the health of humans and domestic ruminants in EU Member States is limited. However, in certain epidemiological circumstances and for particular risk groups the public health impact and thereby also the impact on society and/or the economy can be significant.\n(5) In the years 2008 and 2009, a major increase of human cases of Q fever was observed in the Netherlands, with several human deaths. The epidemiological investigations indicated a link with large dairy goat holdings in the area, where this particular type of milk production has developed rapidly over the past decade. However, the abovementioned EFSA opinion highlighted that the precise reasons for the emergence of clinical problems in the animal population in 2005, and the increase of cases in the human population in 2007 are still unclear.\n(6) On 24 March 2010, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality submitted a request for co-financing in the framework of Decision 2009/470/EC for technical and scientific studies on disease dynamics and the effectiveness of possible control measures applicable to domestic ruminants, such as vaccination of goats.\n(7) The studies for which the Netherlands has requested co financing for will address among other things the following topics: (i) characterisation of the different genotypes of Coxiella burnetii that exist in different animal species in the Netherlands and their difference in virulence, if any; (ii) pathogenicity of Coxiella burnetii in pregnant and non-pregnant goats; (iii) the survival of Coxiella burnetii in manure; and (iv) suitable means of disinfection.\n(8) Pursuant to Article 22 of Decision 2009/470/EC, the Union may undertake, or assist the Member States or international organisations in undertaking, the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of EU veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.\n(9) A financial contribution should be granted to the studies on Q fever in the Netherlands as the outcomes may lead to new insights that may contribute to possible future development of veterinary legislation in the Union, in particular as regards the possible adoption of harmonised rules on monitoring and reporting of this disease.\n(10) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(5), veterinary measures are to be financed under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation are to apply.\n(11) The payment of the financial contribution must be subject to the condition that the studies planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union shall grant the Netherlands financial assistance for their studies on Q fever, as summarised in the Annex.

It also involves the survival of C. burnetii in manure, the different infection routes, the development of immunity, the shedding of C. burnetii in pregnant and non-pregnant goats and general information on the pathogeneses of C. burnetii.\nProject 2 : \u2018Assessment of the virulence of C. burnetii strains in goats\u2019 addresses the question if the current Dutch strain in goats is more virulent than other C. burnetii strains.\nProject 3 : \u2018Pathogeneses of Q fever\u2019 studies the pathogenesis of C. burnetii infections in goats; the role of pregnancy in the pathogenesis of C. burnetii infections; the build up of cellular and humoral immunity; differences in virulence of C. burnetii strains in goats and the protective immunity of natural infection. With the knowledge of the pathogenesis and the within herd transmission, the results of diagnostic testing can better be understood.\nProject 4 : \u2018Inventory of Q fever strains in cattle, sheep, dogs and cats\u2019 studies the relation between Q fever human patients and possible animal sources. The aim is to compare Q fever strains found in different animal species with the strains found in human patients. This is important to be able to exclude animals other than dairy goats as a source of human infections.\nProject 5 : \u2018Effectiveness of vaccination\u2019 compares field studies previously carried out in particular in France with new field studies in the Netherlands to assess the effectiveness of vaccination of goats against Q fever.\nProject 6 : \u2018Search for suitable means of disinfection\u2019 aims at identifying suitable products for disinfection and to assess whether materials like wood, straw, ground and manure can be effectively disinfected. The project includes: (i) the definition of criteria for disinfection products; (ii) the inactivation of C. burnetii and C. burnetii spores in clean fluids; (iii) the inactivation of C. burnetii and C. burnetii spores on complex materials and in manure; and (iv) the inactivation of C. burnetii and C. burnetii spores on complex surfaces."}
