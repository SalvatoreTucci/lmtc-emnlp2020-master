This Annex applies to health claims related to the consumption of a food category, a food, or its constituents (including a nutrient or other substance, or a combination of nutrients/other substances), hereafter referred to as \u2018food\u2019.\n2. In cases where some of the data that are required as described in this Annex are omitted by the applicant, assuming that they do not apply to the application concerned, reasons shall be given for the absence of such data in the application.\n3. The term \u2018application\u2019 hereafter means a stand-alone dossier containing the information and the scientific data submitted for authorisation of the health claim in question.\n4. One application shall be prepared for each individual health claim; this means that only a relationship between a food and a single claimed effect can be the object of each application. However, multiple formulations of a food can be proposed by the applicant as candidates to bear the health claim in the same application, provided the scientific evidence is valid for all proposed formulations of a food bearing that same health claim.\n5. The application shall indicate whether health claim concerned or a similar one has been scientifically evaluated, by a competent national authority of either a Member State or a third country. If so, a copy of the scientific evaluation shall be provided.\n6. Pertinent scientific data are all human and non-human studies, published or unpublished, that are relevant for the substantiation of health claim applied for, by addressing the relationship between the food and the claimed effect, including data in favour and data not in favour of such relationship. Pertinent published human data shall be identified through a comprehensive review.\n7. Journal abstracts and articles published in newspapers, magazines, newsletters or handouts that have not been peer-reviewed shall not be cited. Books or chapters of books for consumers or the general public shall not be cited.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE SCIENTIFIC SUBSTANTIATION\n1. The application shall contain all scientific data, published and unpublished, in favour and not in favour that are pertinent to the health claim, together with a comprehensive review of the data from human studies in order to demonstrate that the health claim is substantiated by the totality of the scientific data and by weighing the evidence. Data from studies in humans addressing the relationship between consumption of the food and the claimed effect is required for substantiation of a health claim.\n2. The application shall contain a comprehensive review of the data from human studies addressing the specific relationship between the food and the claimed effect. This review, and the identification of data considered pertinent to the health claim, should be performed in a systematic and transparent manner in order to demonstrate that the application reflects adequately the balance of all the evidence available.\n3. The substantiation of health claims shall take into account the totality of the available scientific data and, by weighing the evidence, shall demonstrate the extent to which:\n(a) the claimed effect of the food is beneficial for human health;\n(b) a cause and effect relationship is established between consumption of the food and the claimed effect in humans (such as the strength, consistency, specificity, dose-response, and biological plausibility of the relationship);\n(c) the quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed effect could reasonably be achieved as part of a balanced diet;\n(d) the specific study group(s) in which the evidence was obtained is representative of the target population for which the claim is intended.\nFOOD CHARACTERISTICS\nThe following information shall be given with regard to the food constituent, the food or the food category for which the health claim is made.\n1. For a food constituent:\n(a) the source and specifications\u00a0(1), such as physical and chemical properties, composition; and\n(b) where applicable, the microbiological constituents of the food constituent.\n2. For a food or category of food:\n(a) the description of the food or food category, including characterisation of the food matrix and the overall composition including the nutrient content of the food;\n(b) the source and specifications of the food or food category and, in particular, the content of the constituent(s) related to the health claim.\n3. In all cases:\n(a) where applicable, the variability from batch to batch;\n(b) analytical methods applied;\n(c) where applicable, a summary of the studies undertaken on production conditions, batch-to-batch variability, analytical procedures, and of the results and conclusions of the stability studies, and the conclusions with respect to storage conditions and shelf-life;\n(d) where applicable, the relevant data and rationale that the constituent for which the health claim is made is in a form that is available to be used by the human body;\n(e) if absorption is not necessary to produce the claimed effect, such as for plant sterols, fibres, lactic acid bacteria, the relevant data and rationale that the constituent reaches the target site;\n(f) all available data on factors that could affect the absorption or utilisation in the body of the constituent for which the health claim is made.\nORGANISATION OF PERTINENT SCIENTIFIC DATA\n1. Scientific data identified shall be organised in the following order: human data, followed by non-human data if appropriate.\n2. Human data shall be classified according to a hierarchy of study design in the following order:\n(a) human intervention studies, randomised controlled studies, other randomised studies (non-controlled), controlled (non-randomised) studies, other intervention studies;\n(b) human observational studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, other observational studies, such as case reports;\n(c) other human studies dealing with the mechanisms by which the food could be responsible for the claimed effect, including the studies on bioavailability.\n3. Non-human data shall consist in:\n(a) animal data including studies investigating aspects related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion of the food, mechanistic studies, and other studies;\n(b) ex vivo or in vitro data, based on either human or animal biological samples related to the mechanisms of action by which the food could be responsible for the claimed effect, and other non-human studies.\nSUMMARY OF PERTINENT SCIENTIFIC DATA\nIn addition to the requirement of Article 15(3)(g) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 for a summary of the application, applicants shall provide a summary of the pertinent scientific data, which shall contain the following information:\n1. the summary of data from pertinent human studies, indicating to what extent the relationship between the food and the claimed effect is supported by the totality of human data;\n2. the summary of data from pertinent non-human studies, indicating how, and to what extent, the pertinent non-human studies may help to support the relationship between the food and the claimed effect in humans;\n3. the overall conclusions, by taking into account the totality of the data, including evidence in favour and not in favour and by weighing the evidence. The overall conclusions should clearly define to what extent:\n(a) the claimed effect of the food is beneficial for human health;\n(b) a cause and effect relationship is established between the consumption of the food and the claimed effect in humans (such as the strength, consistency, specificity, dose-response, and biological plausibility of the relationship);\n(c) the quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed effect could reasonably be consumed as part of a balanced diet;\n(d) the specific study group(s) in which the evidence was obtained is representative of the target population for which the claim is intended.\nSTRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION\nApplications shall be structured as follows.
