The Commission has to forward the information to the Member States. Pursuant to Article 18 of the said Implementing Regulation that information is to be examined periodically by the Customs Code Committee.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 20 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1225/2011 certain information set out in applications for admission free of customs duty of goods imported by or on behalf of scientific establishments or organisations established inside the Union has to be communicated to the Commission by the Member States to which the application has been submitted.\n(3) Those obligations which date from 1983 are no longer necessary for the good management of imports with relief of customs duties. Moreover they entail an unnecessary administrative burden, both for Member States and the Commission. Thus, in the interest of regulatory simplification and rationality, the corresponding provisions should be deleted or simplified.\n(4) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1225/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1225/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Chapter VII is deleted;\n(2) Article 20 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 324, 10.12.2009, p. 23.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 314, 29.11.2011, p. 20."}
