Cheeses\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of product to which the name in (1) applies\nCheese obtained by slow draining of the curds, following coagulation of unadulterated raw ewe\u2019s milk obtained from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and/or Churra Mondegueira ewes, using the cardoon flower (Cynara cardunculus, L) as rennet. The minimum ripening time for \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 cheese is 30 days. When the ripening time reaches a minimum of 120 days, the designation of origin \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 is qualified as \u2018Velho\u2019 (mature).\nThe main characteristics of the product are as follows:\n\u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019\nShape and consistency Short (flat) regular cylinder with bulging sides and some bulging on the top and no defined edge Short (flat) regular cylinder, slight or no bulging on the sides and no spine\nRind Smooth and semi-soft Smooth to slightly wrinkled and hard to extra hard.\nWeight Between 0.5 and 1.7\u00a0kg 0.7 to 1.2\u00a0kg\nDiameter 9 to 20\u00a0cm 11 to 20\u00a0cm\nHeight 4 to 6\u00a0cm 3 to 6\u00a0cm\nTexture Closed, slightly buttery, loses its shape on cutting, well bound, creamy and smooth, with few or no eyes Closed or with some eyes, slightly dry crumbly body, smooth\nColour White or slightly sallow Yellowish to orange/light brown, becoming darker from the outside towards the centre\nSensory characteristics Smooth, clean and slightly acidic bouquet Pleasant, lingering, clean, strong to slightly strong and slightly spicy/salty bouquet\nProtein 26 to 33\u00a0% 36 to 43\u00a0%\nFats 45 to 60\u00a0% > 60\u00a0%\nHumidity 61 to 69\u00a0% 49 to 56\u00a0%\nAsh 5 to 6.5\u00a0% 7 to 8\u00a0%\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nThe raw materials used are exclusively as follows:\n\u2014 unadulterated raw ewe\u2019s milk obtained from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and/or Churra Mondegueira ewes in the defined geographical area. The rearing and feeding conditions of the animals are subject to specific rules;\n\u2014 edible salt;\n\u2014 the cardoon flower (Cynara cardunculus, L), a plant-based rennet.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nSince open-air rearing is the most common technique, only extensive or semi-extensive production systems are permitted. The animals graze in an area with characteristically wild vegetation including pine forests, thickets and meadows. Transhumance, where the animals are moved to other zones (or pastures) located in the same geographical area (according to the time of the year and available feed) is practised regularly. Other pasture and fodder species are also usually grown in the region and are used as feed supplements for local sheep during periods in which feed is less available. However, and only in times of extreme climatic and soil conditions (snow or drought for instance), straight or compound feedstuffs may be used to strengthen animals\u2019 diets, mainly at the start and end of the gestation period or at the height of the lactation period. The use of these feedstuffs must be authorised by the producer group and is controlled both quantitatively and qualitatively by the certification body.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nGiven that the animals must be of certified genetic or territorial origin, that their diet is governed by strict rules in terms of pasture quality and quantity, that the natural surroundings are crucial for obtaining milk and cheese with the required characteristics, that of all the steps in production are regularly monitored both for product traceability and for the organoleptic qualities of the final product, and that the manufacture and ripening stages are delicate operations both in terms of traceability and the authenticity, hygiene and the sensory properties of the final product, all of the production steps of \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 must take place in the geographical area defined in point 4, from the birth of the animals to the packaging of the cheese, whatever commercial presentation is used.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nSince \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 is a live product which continues to develop even after it is preserved, cut and packaged, these operations may only take place in the region of origin in view of the need to:\n\u2014 guarantee the product\u2019s authenticity and the physical, chemical and organoleptic characteristics which define the special quality of these cheeses \u2013 attributes which only the producers, who live in the region and regularly consume these products, are capable of recognising;\n\u2014 assess the quality of each cheese individually before subjecting it to any of the above-mentioned operations;\n\u2014 ensure that the cheese, even when cut, remains characteristically creamy. To achieve that, it is imperative to select cheeses which are sufficiently mature when the relevant operation is carried out;\n\u2014 ensure that, for \u2018queijo velho\u2019, the slices have the required consistency, with crumbling. To achieve that, it is imperative to select cheeses with the appropriate bouquet and consistency during the ripening phase, which is an opportune time to cut the cheese;\n\u2014 guarantee the traditional reputation of the product is maintained and is not imitated and that the consumer is not misled;\n\u2014 guarantee that the health and hygiene conditions of the product are constantly maintained throughout the various operations;\n\u2014 make it possible to monitor the operations properly and in line with regulatory requirements;\n\u2014 guarantee that each unit or portion of cheese is traceable to its production facilities and its agricultural holding, thereby ensuring the geographical origin of the product.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nIn addition to the mandatory wording required by the law, the following are also mandatory:\n\u2014 the words \u2018QUEIJO SERRA DA ESTRELA \u2013 Protected designation of origin\u2019, supplemented by the qualifier \u2018VELHO\u2019 for cheeses whose ripening exceeds 120 days;\n\u2014 the certification mark bearing the name of the product, the name of the monitoring and certification body and a serial number rendering the product traceable.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area is limited to the municipalities of Carregal do Sal, Celorico da Beira, Fornos de Algodres, Gouveia, Mangualde, Manteigas, Nelas, Oliveira do Hospital, Penalva do Castelo and Seia and to the parishes of Carapito, Corti\u00e7ada, Dornelas, Eirado, Forninhos, Penaverde and Valverde, to the municipality of Aguiar da Beira and the parishes of Anceriz, Barril do Alva, Cerdeira, Coja, Pomares and Vila Cova do Alva, to the municipality of Arganil and the parishes of Aldeia de Carvalho, Cortes do Meio, Erada, Paul, Sarzedo, Unhais da Serra and Verdelhos, to the municipality of Covilh\u00e3 and the parishes of Aldeia Vi\u00e7osa, Cavadoude, Corujeira, Fala, Famalic\u00e3o, Fern\u00e3o Joanes, Ma\u00e7ainhas de Baixo, Mizarela, Pero Soares, Porto da Carne, S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e9 Seixo Amarelo, Trinta, Vale de Estrelas, Valhelhas, Videmonte, Vila Cortez do Mondego and Vila Soeiro, to the municipality of Guarda and the parishes of Mid\u00f5es, P\u00f3voa de Mid\u00f5es and Vila Nova de Oliveirinha, to the municipality of T\u00e1bua and the parishes of Canas de Santa Maria, Ferreir\u00f3s do D\u00e3o, Lob\u00e3o da Beira, Molelos, Mosteiro de Fr\u00e1guas, Nandufe, Parada de Gonta, Sabugosa, S\u00e3o Miguel do Outeiro, Tonda and Tondela, to the municipality of Tondela and the parishes of Aldeia Nova, Carnic\u00e3es, Feital, Fi\u00e3es, Freches, Santa Maria, S\u00e3o Pedro, Tamanho, Torres, Vila Franca das Naves and Vilares, to the municipality of Trancoso and the parishes of Fragosela, Loureiro de Silgueiros, Povolide and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Lourosa and to the municipality of Viseu.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe entire region is located on the Beira uplands, with agro-climactic conditions characterised by long, cold and rainy winters with occasional snow and hot, dry summers.\nOn top of the tree cover mentioned previously, this region contains stretches of shrubs and herbs which make up the diet of the grazing animals. The herbs are mainly composed of brushwood [ericas, ulex (gorse bushes), cytisus (jennets) and genistas (wild jennets or genistas purgans)]. The natural pasture is made up of wild perennial grasses and the cultivated pasture is mainly composed of white clover and subterranean clover. As for the flowers, acidophilus species prevail and are mainly composed of grasses and leguminous plants which can withstand the cold, acidity and low soil fertility. The fodder crops most regularly used are essentially as follows: oats, rye, corn, fodder sorghum and marsh grass or yearly ray-grass.\nThe region is home to two breeds used exclusively for producing this cheese: the \u2018Bordaleira Serra da Estrela\u2019 and the \u2018Churra Mondegueira\u2019. For centuries, animals have fully taken advantage of the rough pasture in this region.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nAs a result of the know-how of its producers, \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 is obtained exclusively from raw milk, using the cardoon flower as a natural rennet.\n\u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 has distinctive characteristics due to the production conditions described above. It is commercialised as a flat regular cylinder with slightly bulging sides on its upper surface and no defined edge, with a smooth, semi-soft rind and a closed, slightly buttery texture which loses its shape on cutting. It is well-bound, creamy and smooth, sometimes containing a few white or sallow eyes. It has a smooth, clean and slightly acidic bouquet. These characteristics grow naturally stronger during the maturing process, leading to the production of \u2018Queijo Serra da Estrela\u2019 Velho, which can be described as follows: smooth to slightly rough rind, hard to extra hard consistency, closed texture or with a few eyes, body dry and slightly crumbly, smooth, dark yellow to orange getting darker from the outside towards the centre; pleasant, lingering, clean, strong to slightly strong and slightly spicy/salty bouquet.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe climate and soil conditions of the Serra da Estrela region have allowed agricultural and forestry activities to develop, one of the main ones being the rearing of sheep from the local \u2018Bordaleira Serra da Estrela\u2019 and \u2018Churra Mondegueria\u2019 breeds. The milk they produce is used to make the renowned cheeses and creamy cheeses (requeij\u00e4o) of Serra da Estrela, which have distinctive characteristics in terms of colour, fragrance, bouquet and texture.\nThe region and the cheeses produced there were already mentioned in texts by Roman authors. The cheeses were also described as the food of choice on board ship during the Age of Discovery and were mentioned in sixteenth-century plays.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5, paragraph 7, of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nhttp://www.dgadr.pt/images/docs/val/dop_igp_etg/Valor/CE_QueijoSE_Versao_Comissao.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
