whereas information relating to uses on cereals, vines and bananas has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with the requirements of Article 4(1) (f) of Directive 91/414/EEC; whereas the information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to fix certain maximum residue levels;\n(3) Whereas where no Community maximum residue level or provisional MRL exists Member States shall establish a national provisional maximum residue level in accordance with Article 4(1) (f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before the authorisation may be granted;\n(4) Whereas at the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91 /414/EEC the technical and scientific evaluation of azoxystrobin was finalised on 22 April 1998 in the format of the Commission review report for azoxystrobin; whereas in this review report the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for azoxystrobin was set at 0.1 mg/kg bw/day; whereas the lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with azoxystrobin has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(9) and it has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed in this Directive do not give rise to an exceedence of this ADI;\n(5) Whereas acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an acute reference dose were not noted during the evaluation and discussion which preceded the inclusion of azoxystrobin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC;\n(6) Whereas for certain agricultural products the use conditions for azoxystrobin have already been defined in a manner which permits the establishing of definitive maximum residue levels;\n(7) Whereas to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination for all those products covered by Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC; whereas the setting at Community level of such provisional maximum residue levels does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for azoxystrobin in accordance with Article 4(1) (f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and in accordance with Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC in particular part B, Section 2.4.2.3 to this Annex; whereas four years is considered a sufficient period of time during which to establish most further uses of azoxystrobin; whereas after that period these provisional maximum residue levels should become definitive;\n(8) Whereas the Community's trading partners have been consulted about the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels have been considered; whereas the possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the submission of acceptable data;\n(9) Whereas the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account;\n(10) Whereas this Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The following pesticide residues shall be added to part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:\n>TABLE>", "The following pesticide residues shall be added to part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC:\n>TABLE>", "The following pesticide residues shall be added to Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC:\n>TABLE>", "1.
