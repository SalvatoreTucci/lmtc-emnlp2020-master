That list includes nonanoic acid.\n(2) Nonanoic acid has been included into Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 2 through Commission Directive 2012/41/EU\u00a0(4), and is therefore considered as approved for that product-type by virtue of Article 86 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Furthermore, nonanoic acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 10, masonry preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive. The evaluation covered use as an algaecide for the curative treatment of construction materials. That specific use is now covered by product-type 2 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(4) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 3 April 2012 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(5) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 27 September 2013, in an assessment report.\n(6) It appears from that report that biocidal products used as an algaecide for the curative treatment of construction materials and containing nonanoic acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(7) The existing approval of nonanoic acid for product-type 2 does not cover the conditions resulting from the evaluation of products used as an algaecide for the curative treatment of construction materials. It is therefore appropriate to complement that existing approval with those conditions. For the purpose of allowing all interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements following from the recent redefinition of biocidal product-types, it is furthermore appropriate to modify the date of approval originally provided for by Directive 2012/41/EU.\n(8) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Nonanoic acid shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 2, subject to the specifications, the new conditions and the new date of approval set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive No 2012/41/EU of 26 November 2012 amending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to extend the inclusion in Annex I thereto of the active substance nonanoic acid to product type 2 (OJ L 327, 27.11.2012, p. 28).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nNonanoic acid, Pelargonic acid IUPAC Name: Nonanoic acid 896\u00a0g/kg 1 October 2015 30 September 2025 2 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n1.
