It provided for maximum amounts of support for withdrawal, non-harvesting and green harvesting operations. The mechanism introduced by that Regulation was subsequently supplemented by measures under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014\u00a0(3) in the form of additional, targeted support for certain quantities of products, calculated on the basis of traditional exports to Russia.\n(3) The Russian import ban continues to create a serious threat of market disturbances caused by significant price falls due to the fact that an important export market has suddenly become unavailable. For such a market situation, the normal measures available under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 still appear to be insufficient. The mechanism based on support for certain quantities of products under Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014 needs therefore to be prolonged.\n(4) Taking the estimated quantities affected by the ban into account, the Union financial assistance should be prolonged in accordance with the quantities of products concerned. The calculation of those quantities should be made for each Member State in accordance with the level of its average exports to Russia of the products concerned for the previous three years in the following months: April and May for fruit and January to May for vegetables. Furthermore, due to their seasonal exports, lemons of CN code 0805\u00a050\u00a010 should be added to the list of products eligible for support under Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014.\n(5) Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,", "main_body": ["Amendment of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 1031/2014 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is
