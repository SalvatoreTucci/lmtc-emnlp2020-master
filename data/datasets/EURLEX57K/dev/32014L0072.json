These harsh environmental conditions require the use of lead. Neither the substitution nor the elimination of lead in these components is technically practicable.\n(3) Manufacturers need additional time to make possible lead-free alternatives technically practicable and to demonstrate reliability. The use of lead in solders and termination finishes of electrical and electronic components and finishes of printed circuit boards used in ignition modules and other electrical and electronic engine control systems should therefore be exempted from the prohibition until 31 December 2018. This is a relatively short transition period which is unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
