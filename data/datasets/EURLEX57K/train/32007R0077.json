This is optional, subsidised distillation intended to support the wine market and help ensure an uninterrupted supply to the potable alcohol sector. To that end, contracts are concluded between wine producers and distillers. These contracts were notified to the Commission by the Member States up to 15 January 2007.\n(2) For the 2006/07 wine year, distillation was opened in the period 1 October to 23 December. The quantities of wine covered by distillation contracts notified to the Commission by the Member States exceed the limits imposed by available budget resources and the absorption capacity of the potable alcohol sector. A single percentage should therefore be fixed for acceptance of the quantities notified for distillation.\n(3) Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 63a(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000, the Member States are to approve distillation contracts within a period beginning on 30 January.
