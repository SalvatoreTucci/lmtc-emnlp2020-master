On the basis of that Regulation, the import of products containing milk, milk products, soya and soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children originating in or consigned from China is prohibited. Furthermore, identity and physical checks, including sampling and analysis to control the presence of melamine, are carried out on approximately 20 % of consignments originating in or consigned from China of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed and of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya and soya products.\n(2) Since July 2009, only one non-compliant sample was reported by the competent authorities of the Member States. The findings in that sample, reported in 2011, slightly exceeded the maximum level of melamine in ammonium bicarbonate. As a result, it is appropriate to repeal the special conditions governing the import of infant milk, other milk products, soya and soya products and of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed originating in or consigned from China.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1135/2009 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a031, 1.2.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1135/2009 of 25 November 2009 imposing special conditions governing the import of certain products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/798/EC (OJ L\u00a0311, 26.11.2009, p.\u00a03)."}
