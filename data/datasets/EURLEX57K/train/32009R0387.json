These practices ensure that the key characteristics of the PDO product are maintained.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

It comes in the shape of flat cylinders, 27 to 30 cm in diameter, 7 to 9 cm high, convex on the outside, weighing between 4 and 4,5 kg, with a fine bloom on the rind consisting of a white mould-type down that may have orange to ivory-coloured marbling of the kind caused by yeasts and bacteria active in the ripening process.\nIt contains a maximum level of 48\u00a0g of fat per 100\u00a0g of cheese after total desiccation and the dry matter must not weigh less than 52\u00a0g per 100\u00a0g of cheese.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nBleu du Vercors-Sassenage PDO is produced within the Massif du Vercors, in 13 communes in the department of Dr\u00f4me and 14 communes in the department of Is\u00e8re.\nDepartment of Dr\u00f4me\nThe communes of Bouvante (sectors C, D, E, L 1, K, I 1, I 2, A I), \u00c9chevis, Le Chaffal, La Chapelle-en-Vercors, L\u00e9oncel, Ombl\u00e8ze, Plan-de-Baix, Saint-Agnan-en-Vercors, Saint-Jean-en-Royans (sector E), Saint-Julien-en-Vercors, Saint-Laurent-en-Royans (sectors D 1 and D 2), Saint-Martin-en-Vercors and Vassieux-en-Vercors.\nDepartment of Is\u00e8re\nThe communes of Autrans, Ch\u00e2telus, Choranche, Corren\u00e7on-en-Vercors, Engins, Izeron (the localities Fressinet and Gout\u00e9 in sectors F 1, F 2 and G 1 and Malache in sector G 2), Lans-en-Vercors, Malleval, M\u00e9audre, Presles, Rencurel, Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte, Saint-Pierre-de-Ch\u00e9rennes (the localities Alevoux, Bayettes and Guillon in sector C1, and sectors C 2 and D 2), and Villard-de-Lans.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nEvery milk producer, processing plant and maturing plant fills in a \u2018declaration of aptitude\u2019, which is registered with the INAO and enables it to identify all the operators involved. All operators must keep their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese at the INAO\u2019s disposal.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\nAll cheese marketed under the designation of origin must bear a mark that identifies the production unit and allows the product to be traced.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced and the cheese manufactured and matured within the geographical area.\nThe milk used to produce Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage must be from dairy herds made up of cows of the Montb\u00e9liard, Abondance and Villard breeds only. The animals must be fed on fodder originating in the defined geographical area. The milk used is whole cow\u2019s milk, which may be partly skimmed. It must come from the four most recent milkings only. The cheese is made from milk heated to a maximum temperature of 76\u00a0\u00b0C and inoculated with P\u00e9nicillium roqueforti. The milk must be curdled using rennet at a temperature between 31\u00a0\u00b0C and 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The curd is stirred and poured into moulds in several layers without pressing. The cheeses are salted in their individual moulds. They must not be salted for more than three days. The cheeses mature in the ripening chamber for at least 21 days from the date of curdling; this allows them to develop in a balanced way.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nEvidence of this cheese being made in the Massif du Vercors goes back to the 14th century. In a deed of June 1338, Baron Albert de Sassenage granted the local people complete freedom to sell their cheese. Many written accounts attest to its renown, including Pierre Larousse\u2019s Grand Dictionnaire Universel du XIX which mentions that King Fran\u00e7ois I was very fond of it. The cheese was made on farms in the traditional way up until the early years of the 20th century. In 1933, a dairy began making the cheese following the traditional formula. More recently, farm production has been enjoying a new boom.\nThe Massif du Vercors is a well-defined mass of limestone which stands 1\u00a0000 metres above the surrounding plains. It is characterised by long, cradle-shaped wet valleys and cirques and closed coombs overlooked by cliffs. The Vercors has a mountain climate: the summers are short, it is always cool at night, autumn comes early and snow may start falling in October and remain until April or May. The climate is softened by the mitigating effects of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The altitude, the clay-limestone soil and the fairly wet mountain climate make the pastures on this massif especially good. This combination of factors also give the Massif du Vercors its specific character from a botanical point of view. The diverse types of landscape in this natural environment mean that different, complementary areas of pasture can be grazed, offering abundant supplies of excellent quality nourishment. This forms the basis of the herd\u2019s diet and gives the milk, hence the cheese, its typical characteristics.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Institut National de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress : 51, Rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris\nTel. : +33 (0)1 53 89 80 00\nFax : +33 (0)1 53 89 80 60\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut National des Appellations d\u2019Origine is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName : Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R\u00e9pression des Fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress : 59, Boulevard Vincent Auriol 75703 PARIS C\u00e9dex 13\nTel. : +33 (0)1 44 87 17 17\nFax : +33 (0)1 44 97 30 37\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nThe product must bear the wording \u2018Appellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2019 and the name of the designation of origin\nThe words \u2018fabrication fermi\u00e8re\u2019 or \u2018fromage fermier\u2019 or any other similar wording that suggests the product was produced on a farm may be used only by producers who are farmers."}
