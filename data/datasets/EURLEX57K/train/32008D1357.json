They cause many delays for recipients, place a disproportionate burden on the programme\u2019s administration and provide no added value given the nature of the grants awarded.\n(5) In order to allow selection decisions to be implemented more quickly and efficiently, it is necessary to replace the advisory procedure with an obligation on the Commission to inform the European Parliament and the Member States without delay about any measures taken for the implementation of Decision No 1720/2006/EC without the assistance of a committee,", "main_body": ["Decision No 1720/2006/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
