They are kept under extensive holding conditions and in free range where calves stay always close to their mother.\n(3) It is justified to take account of the Dutch request, provided that the extension of the maximum period for tagging does not affect the quality of information provided by the Dutch database for bovine animals and that there is no movement of bovine animals to which eartags have not been applied.\n(4) In the case of animals, which have not been tagged until the age of 6 months, the identity of the mother should be verified by a DNA test.
