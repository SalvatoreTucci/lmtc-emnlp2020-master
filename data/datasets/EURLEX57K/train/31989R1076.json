DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to leeks of the varieties (cultivars) grown from Allium porrum L., to be supplied fresh to the consumer, leeks for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of this standard is to define the quality requirements for leeks after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the leeks must be:\n- whole (this requirement does not apply, however, to roots and ends of leaves, which may be cut),\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, pratically free of visible foreign matter; however, the roots may have soil adhering to them,\n- fresh in appearance, with wilted or withered leaves removed,\n- not running to seed,\n- free of abnormal external moisture, i.e. adequately 'dried' if they have been washed,\n- free of foreign smell and/or taste.\nIf leaves are cut, they must be cut neatly.\nThe development and condition of the leeks must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nLeeks are classified in three classes defined below:\n(i) Class I\nLeeks in this class must be of good quality. However, they may have slight superficial defects, provided that these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package. Slight traces of soil within the shaft are permitted. The white part must represent at least one third of the total or half the sheathed part.\nAt least one-third of the total length or half the sheathed part must be white to greenish white.\nHowever, in early leeks (1) the white to greenish white part must represent at least one-quarter of the total length or one-third of the sheathed part.\n(ii) Class II\nThis class includes leeks which do not qualify for inclusion in Class I but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe white to greenish white part of the leek must represent at least one-quarter of the total length or one-third of the sheathed part.\nHowever, they may show:\n- a tender flowering stem, provided that it is enclosed within the sheathed part,\n- slight bruising and traces of rust on the leaves, but not elsewhere,\n- slight defects in colouring,\n- traces of soil within the shaft.\n(iii) Class III (1)\nThis class comprises leeks which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes but satisfy the requirement for Class II.\nHowever, they may show:\n- a the flowering stem if this does not detract from the edibility of the product,\n- defects in colouring,\n- bruising and traces of rust, but only on the leaves,\n- slight traces of soil on the outside.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\n(i) Sizing is determined by the diameter measured at right angles to the axis above the swelling of the neck.\nThe minimum diameter is fixed at 8 mm for early leeks and 10 mm for other leeks.\n(ii) For Class I, the diameter of the largest leek in the same bundle or package must not be more than twice the diameter of the smallest.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size are allowed in each package, or in each bundle where the leeks are presented unpackaged, for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of leeks not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those for Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n(ii) Class II\n10 % by number or weight of leeks satisfying neither the requirements for the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting, marked bruising or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\n(iii) Class III\n15 % by number or weight of leeks not satisfying the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting, marked bruising or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\nFor all classes, 10 % by number or weight of leeks not conforming to the minimum diameter requirement or, in the case of leeks in Class I, the uniformity requirement.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package, or each bundle in the same package, must be uniform and contain only leeks of the same origin, quality and size (where, for this criterion, uniformity is prescribed), and appreciably the same development and colouring.\nIn the case of leeks in Class III, it is enough that the origin is uniform.\nThe visible part of the contents of each package or bundle must be representative of the entire contents.\nB. Packaging\nThe leeks must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, and particularly of paper or stamps bearing trade specifications, is allowed provided that the printing or labelling has been done with a non-toxic ink or glue.\nC. Presentation\nThe leeks may be presented as follows:\n- in an orderly arrangement in the package,\n- or in bundles, whether or not in a package.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package, or each bundle delivered in bulk, must bear the following particulars legibly and indelibly marked and visible from the outside.\nWhere the leeks are put up in packages, these particulars are to be grouped on the same side.\nA. Identification\n1.2 // packer and/or dispatcher   // name and address or officially used or accepted code mark.\nB. Nature of produce\n'Leeks', if the contents are not visible from the outside or 'Early leeks' in all cases for that type of leeks.\nC. Origin of produce\nCountry of origin and, optionally, district where grown or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- class,\n- number of bundles (for leeks packed in bundles and boxed).\nE. Official control mark (optional)\n(1) Direct-drilled, non-transplanted leeks, harvested from late winter to early summer.\n(1) Additional class as provided for in Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72. The application of this quality class or some of its requirements is subject to a decision to be taken pursuant to Article 4 (1) of that Regulation."}
