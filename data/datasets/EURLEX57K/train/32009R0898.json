From the assessment of that information, it appears that Saint Lucia complies with the relevant requirements laid down in that Regulation and should therefore be included in the list set out in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003.\n(5) Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the following entry is inserted between the entry for Cayman Islands and that for Montserrat:\n\u2018LC Saint Lucia\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1."}
