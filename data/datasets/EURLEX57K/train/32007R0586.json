Applications for licences for exports with or without refund have been used, inter alia, for monitoring Community exports. In current circumstances, for the purposes of good management, it is still essential to monitor the trend with respect to licence applications for exports with refund. On the other hand, it is no longer necessary to monitor exports without refund. Therefore, in the interests of simplification, the obligation to present an export certificate should be limited to exports for which a refund is claimed.\n(3) Following the most recent amendment to Commission Regulation (EEC) 2973/79 of 21 December 1979 laying down detailed rules for the application of granting of assistance for the export of beef and veal products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country\u00a0(3), the annual quota of 5\u00a0000 tonnes of fresh, chilled or frozen beef for export to the United States of America is no longer divided into three-month periods. The current terms and conditions for applying for and issuing export licences should therefore be adapted to this new situation.\n(4) In order to be consistent, the terms and conditions for applying for and issuing export licences for beef and veal products which may benefit from a special import treatment in Canada should also be adapted.\n(5) Member States shall notify to the Commission, once a week, on Monday by 13.00, licence applications lodged by operators during the preceding week. In order to be consistent with the rules in force in other meat sectors, in the case of beef and veal Member States should be required to notify licence applications lodged by operators from Monday to Friday in any given week on the Friday afternoon of that week.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 is amended as follows:\n1.
