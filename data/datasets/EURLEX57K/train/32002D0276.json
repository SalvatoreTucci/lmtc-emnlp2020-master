It also determined that seed of certain species produced in third countries was equivalent to seed produced in the Community. Those determinations apply to Croatia and Uruguay only as regards seed of certain species.\n(2) An examination of the rules of Croatia and the manner in which they are applied has shown that in respect of the species listed in Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC and 66/402/EEC in respect of species in addition to Zea mays and Directive 69/208/EEC, the prescribed field inspections satisfy the conditions laid down in those Directives and that the conditions applied by Croatia to seed harvested and controlled there afford the same assurances as the corresponding conditions applicable within the Community.\n(3) An examination of the rules of Uruguay and the manner in which they are applied has shown that in respect of the species listed in Directive 66/402/EEC in addition to Zea mays the prescribed field inspections satisfy the conditions laid down in that Directive and that the conditions applied by Uruguay to seed harvested and controlled there afford the same assurances as the corresponding conditions within the Community.\n(4) Consequently, the equivalence already recognised in respect of seed produced in Croatia and Uruguay should be extended to cover other species.\n(5) Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC allow for the simplification of procedures for official seed certification provided that inspections may be carried out by inspectors other than those charged with official examination by the seed certification authority. An equivalent approach has been incorporated in the seed schemes of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n(6) Commission Decision 98/320/EC(9) made provision for a temporary experiment applicable to seed produced within the Community to assess whether seed sampling for the purpose of seed testing and seed testing under official supervision constitute an improved alternative to the procedures for official certification. That approach was approved by the OECD which adopted a derogatory experiment on seed sampling and seed analysis. It is therefore appropriate to extend the scope of the Community experiment to seed produced in third countries participating in that OECD experiment.\n(7) According to Decision 95/514/EC, the United States of America may avail itself of a derogation from the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) rules for sampling, testing and the issue of seed analysis certificates, provided that the provisions of the Association of Official Seed Analysts are applied. Canada would like to avail itself of a similar derogation. It appears appropriate to grant such a derogation also to Canada.\n(8) Decision 95/514/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 95/514/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
