Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by means of the apparatus 'Fully automatic ultrasonic carcass grading' (Autofom).\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 ultrasonic transducers, 2 MHz (Krautkr\u0102\u00a4mer, SFK 2 NP) with an operating of 25 mm between each transducer.\nThe ultrasonic data comprise measurements of fat thickness and muscle depth.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean mean content by means of a central data-processing unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcass shall be calculated on the basis of 29 individual measuring points according to the following formula:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nwhere:\n^y= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass.\n4. The description of the measurement points and the description of the statistical method are laid down in the Swedish Protocol, Part II, submitted to the Commission under the terms of Article 3(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcasses weighing between 50 and 120 kg.\""}
