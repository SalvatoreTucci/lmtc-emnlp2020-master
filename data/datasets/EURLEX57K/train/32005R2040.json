In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the arrangements in the pigmeat sector, traders' access to the arrangements should be subject to compliance with specific conditions.\n(7) In order to guarantee proper management of the arrangements, Member States should provide the Commission with precise information on the quantities actually imported. For reasons of clarity, a single form is to be used for the transmission of information on quantities between the Member States and the Commission.\n(8) In order to guarantee a smooth transition to the new arrangements and, in particular, ensure that products falling under serial numbers 09.4752 and 09.4756 which are imported under licences as from 1 July 2005 in the context of the additional Protocols benefit from the lowering of customs duty to 0\u00a0%, provision should be made for refunding the amounts paid in excess, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(7) and by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(8).\n(9) Following the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/97 of 29 September 1997 laying down rules of application in the pigmeat sector for the arrangements covered by the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania, the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Hungary\u00a0(9) now relate to only Bulgaria and Romania. It is necessary, therefore, to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1898/97 and adopt a new Regulation laying down detailed rules for applying the trade aspects of the Europe Agreements with those two countries in the pigmeat sector.\n(10) The annual quantities to be imported are set for periods beginning on 1 July.\n(11) The Additional Protocols to the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria and Romania are to enter into force on the first day of the month following that in which the last instrument of approval is lodged.\n(12) For Bulgaria, the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement is 1 July 2005. Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Bulgaria from that date.\n(13) For Romania, the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement is 1 August 2005. Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Romania from that date.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat.", "main_body": ["Import licences shall be presented for imports into the Community from Bulgaria or Romania of products falling under serial numbers 09.4671, 09.4752 and 09.4756, as referred to in Annex I hereto, under the arrangements laid down by Decisions 2003/286/EC and 2005/430/EC and by Decisions 2003/18/EC and 2005/431/EC.\nThe annual quantities of products eligible for the arrangements and the reduced rate of customs duty established by the Common Customs Tariff are laid down in Annex I for each tariff quota with a serial number appearing in that Annex.", "The annual quantities referred to in Article 1 shall be spread over four periods as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September,\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December,\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March,\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for import licences may be presented only by natural or legal persons who, at the time of lodging the application, are able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member States that they have been engaged in trade in pigmeat with third countries for at least twelve months.\nHowever, retail or catering establishments selling their products to the final consumer shall be ineligible for the arrangements referred to in Article 1.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications shall mention only one of the serial numbers referred to in Annex I.\nLicence applications may cover several products falling under different Combined Nomenclature codes and originating in a single country.
