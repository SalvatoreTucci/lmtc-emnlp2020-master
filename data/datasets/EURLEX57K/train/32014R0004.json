These developments need to be reflected on the Regulation.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 640/2009\nRegulation (EC) No 640/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following\n(a) motors specified to operate wholly immersed in a liquid;\n(b) motors completely integrated into a product (for example gear, pump, fan or compressor) of which the energy performance cannot be tested independently from the product;\n(c) motors specified to operate exclusively:\n(i) at altitudes exceeding 4\u00a0000 metres above sea-level;\n(ii) where ambient air temperatures exceed 60\u00a0\u00b0C;\n(iii) in maximum operating temperature above 400\u00a0\u00b0C;\n(iv) where ambient air temperatures are less than \u2013\u00a030\u00a0\u00b0C for any motor or less than 0\u00a0\u00b0C for a motor with water cooling;\n(v) where the water coolant temperature at the inlet to a product is less than 0\u00a0\u00b0C or exceeding 32\u00a0\u00b0C; or\n(vi) in potentially explosive atmospheres as defined in Directive 94/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3);\n(d) brake motors,\n(2) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply six months after the date of entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 23.7.2009, p. 26.\nANNEX\nAmendments to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 640/2009\nIn Annex I, point 2, the following subparagraph is inserted after the third subparagraph:\n\u2018Where the size of the rating plate makes it impossible to mark all the information referred to in point 1, only the nominal efficiency (\u03b7) at full rated load and voltage (UN) shall be marked.\u2019."}
