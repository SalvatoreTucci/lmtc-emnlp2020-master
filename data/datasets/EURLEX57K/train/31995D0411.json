Carcases (with the neck skin still attached)\nRandom  samples are evenly distributed through the whole consignment. Sampling consists of pieces of about  10 g of neck skin to be removed aseptically with a sterile scalpel and tweezers. Samples should be  kept refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C until examination. For examination the samples are diluted 10-fold in  buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16 to 20 hours. Subsequently the  pre-enrichment broths are tested for the presence of salmonella according to the method described  in Section C. Portions of the pre-enrichment broths may be pooled to a maximum of 10 for  enrichment.\nSamples are duly marked and identified.\n2. Carcases without neck skin, carcase parts and offal\nPieces of tissue of about 25 g are obtained  by punching a sterile cork borer into the meat surface or cutting a slice of tissue with sterile  instruments. Samples should be kept refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C until examination. For examination the  samples are diluted 10-fold in buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16 to 20  hours. Subsequently the pre-enrichment broths are tested for the presence of salmonella according  to the method described in Section C. Portions of the pre-enrichment broths may be pooled to a  maximum of 10 for enrichment.\nSamples are duly marked and identified.\nSECTION B NUMBER OF SAMPLES TO BE TAKEN\nThe number of packing units in the consignment of which  separate random samples are to be taken is as follows:\n>TABLE>\nDepending on the weight of the packing units, the number of samples can be  reduced by using the following multiplication factors:\n>TABLE>\nSECTION C MICROBIOLOGICAL METHOD FOR THE EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLES\nMicrobiological testing of the samples for salmonella must be carried out according to the  standard method of the International Organization for Standardization, ISO 6579:1993. However,  methods offering equivalent guarantees may be authorized on a case-by-case basis by the Council,  acting on a proposal from the Commission."}
