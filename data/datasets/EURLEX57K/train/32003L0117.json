This is because the said activity provides a livelihood for some 350 retailers who employ about the same number of wage earners. Quite a large proportion of these retail outlets are in the sparsely populated mountain areas where they provide a neighbourhood service and thereby help indirectly to keep the population from moving away.\n(4) Immediate and complete alignment with the tax rules for tobacco in mainland France would depress economic activity linked to manufactured tobacco in Corsica which, at present, provides the abovementioned jobs.\n(5) Therefore, to prevent damage to the island's economic and social equilibrium, it is both essential and justifiable to grant a derogation with effect from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2009, by which France may apply a rate of excise duty that is lower than the national rate to cigarettes and other manufactured tobaccos released for consumption in Corsica.\n(6) By the end of this derogation period the tax rules for manufactured tobaccos released for consumption in Corsica must have been brought fully into line with the rules for mainland France. Nevertheless, too abrupt a change should be avoided and there should therefore be an intermediate increase in the excise duty currently levied on cigarettes in Corsica.\n(7) To avoid undermining the smooth functioning of the internal market, the volume of cigarettes eligible for this derogating measure should be limited to an annual quota of 1200 tonnes.\n(8) Directives 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC should accordingly be amended,", "main_body": ["Article 3(4) of Directive 92/79/EEC is replaced by the following:\n\"4. By derogation from Article 2, from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2009 the French Republic may continue to apply a reduced rate of excise duty to cigarettes released for consumption in Corsica. This rate shall apply solely to an annual quota of 1200 tonnes.\nFrom 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2007 the reduced rate must equal at least 35 % of the price for cigarettes in the price category most in demand in Corsica.\nFrom 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 the reduced rate must equal at least 44 % of the price for cigarettes in the price category most in demand in Corsica.\"", "Article 3(4) of Directive 92/80/EEC shall be replaced by the following:\n\"4.
