The use of lead in low voltage ceramic capacitors for industrial monitoring and control instruments should therefore be exempted from the prohibition until 31 December 2020. In view of the innovation cycles for IMCIs this is a relatively short transition period which is unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) In accordance with the repair-as-produced principle of Directive 2011/65/EU, which is meant to extend the lifetime of compliant products once placed on the market, spare parts shall benefit from this exemption past its end date without time limitations.\n(5) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
