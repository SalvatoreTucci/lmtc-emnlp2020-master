The aid would thus help to solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal  industry, pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 2 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nContrary to this restructuration objective, the Commission notes that aid to cover operating losses has increased by more than 70 % compared with 1986.\nDevelopments over the last few years should therefore be judged in accordance with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, particularly those mentioned in Article 2 (1) thereof.\nIn this connection, it is clear that the procedures for granting the undertakings concerned aid to cover operating losses do not encourage the coal industry to become competitive again by means of restructuring, modernization and rationalization  measures.\nThe fact that the amount of aid is related to the quantity of coal produced encourages the maintenance of production capacity which in the long term has no prospect of becoming profitable.\nMoreover, this policy is not designed primarily to help solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the Spanish coal industry in accordance with the criteria and objectives in Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nSince there is no prospect of a substantial proportion of production becoming profitable, it is not possible to authorize a continual automatic increase in aid.\nIn fact, the increases in the price of coal which have already taken place, or are expected, on the Spanish coal market should have resulted in a reduction in aid by reducing the non-competitiveness of this production capacity.\nConsequently, the aid to cover operating losses planned for 1991 should not exceed the amount authorized in Decision No 89/102/ECSC, which includes additional aid for 1989 to cover operating losses by the Camocha mine, which is also the subject of this  Decision, namely a total of Pta 50 034,8 million.\nIn view of the transitional nature of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, which expires on 31 December 1993, and the need to make the Community coal industry profitable in the long term, there must be a phased reduction of Community aid and this must be  accompanied by plans for restructuring, rationalization and modernization as mentioned in the conditions for implementing Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nSo that the Commission can check that the implementing conditions of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC have been fulfilled as regards the aid to cover operating losses, the Spanish Government should be asked to provide, before 31 December 1990, a plan, covering  the period up to 31 December 1993 at the latest, for reducing the aforementioned aid.\nIII\nThe additional aid which the Spanish Government intends to grant in respect of 1988 and 1989 to cover operating losses is intended to make up the deficit of the Camocha mine, which belongs to Minero Siderurgica de Ponferrada, and to prevent immediate  closure of this mine and the social and regional consequences which would ensue from sudden termination of production. Since, as was explained above, most of the production from the mine in question has no prospect of long-term profitability, it is  essential in the short term to implement a plan to restructure activities.\nIV\nUnder Article 12 of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, coal undertakings are authorized to grant rebates on their list prices for production costs or deliveries of coking coal, blast furnace coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces for the iron and steel  industry of the Community under long-term contract. The rebates allowed must not cause the delivered prices of Community coal and coke to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke made from non-member  country coking coal.\nThe aid for deliveries of coking coal, coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces of the iron and steel industry of the Community, which totals Pta 1 400 million, which has decreased by 46 % compared with 1989 as the result of a decline in  deliveries, helps to make up the difference between the price charged on the world market and the cost of producing Spanish coal for production in the order of 215 000 tonnes. Hence the aid is compatible with the provisions of Article 4 of that  Decision.\nThis aid for deliveries of coking coal, coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces of the iron and steel industry of the Community should help the process of rationalizing the coal industry, particularly by staggering the closure of certain pits as  part of regional industry redevelopment policy. It thus helps to solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry as referred to in the third indent of Article 2 (1) of this Decision.\nV\nThe Spanish Government has informed the Commission of its intention of granting the coal industry aid to the mining environment of Pta 268 million in 1990. This aid is for work on spoil heaps and water purification.\nThis aid has to be notified to the Commission under point (b) of Annex 2 as referred to in Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and assessed in accordance with Article 10 (2) of that Decision.\nIn the Commission's opinion, the amount of aid is so small that it will not give the Spanish coal industry a competitive advantage over other coal undertakings in the Community. The aid is designed to improve the environment in the affected areas and  thus help to solve the regional problems related to developments in the coal industry as referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.\nThe Spanish Government has informed the Commission of its intention of granting aid to promote innovation in the coal industry in 1990. The aid amounts to Pta 280 million, which is 54 % less than in 1989, and will be divided among the following  coalfields: Central Asturiana, Bierzo, Villablino, Narcea, Le\u0e23\u0e13n-Este, Palencia, Arag\u0e23\u0e13n, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.\nThis aid is intended to ensure that research results find practical application in production as quickly as possible and should thus help to improve the competitiveness of the Spanish coal industry. The aid has to be notified to the Commission under  point (b) of Annex 2 as referred to in Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and assessed in accordance with Article 10 (2) of that Decision.\nThe aid is so small that it will not provide Spanish undertakings with any significant competitive advantage over other coal undertakings in the Community.\nThe measure will help to improve the competitiveness of the coal industry in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 2 (1) of the Decision,", "main_body": ["     Article 1\nThe Spanish Government is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Pta 51 982 800 000 to the Spanish coal industry for the 1990 calendar year.
