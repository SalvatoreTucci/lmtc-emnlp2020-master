Where testing or sampling is required that is not covered by these methods and sampling techniques, the Competent Body or bodies assessing the application (hereinafter referred to as the Competent Body) shall indicate which testing and/or sampling methods it considers acceptable.\nWhere appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the Competent Body. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO\u00a014001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (NB: it is not required to implement such management schemes).\nThese criteria aim in particular at promoting:\n\u2014 the use of renewable materials and/or recycling of organic matter derived from the collection and/or processing of waste material and therefore contributing to a minimisation of solid waste at the final disposal (e.g. at landfill),\n\u2014 the reduction of environmental damage or risks from heavy metals and other hazardous compounds due to application of the product.\nThe criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of soil improvers that have a lower environmental impact during the whole lifecycle of the product\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ingredients\nThe following ingredients are admitted:\n1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organic ingredients\nA product shall only be considered for the award of the Eco-label if it does not contain peat and its organic matter content is derived from the processing and/or re-use of waste (as defined in Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste\u00a0(1) and in Annex I to the said Directive).\nThe applicant shall provide the Competent Body with the detailed composition of the product, and a declaration of compliance with the above requirement.\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sludges\nProducts shall not contain sewage sludge.
