It is therefore necessary to define the technical standards that will make it possible to satisfy the requirements of quality and reliability. Verifications using four fingers have a much lower false rejection rate and failure to acquire rate compared to single finger verifications. The Central Visa Information System (CS-VIS) should therefore be able to perform biometric verifications for accessing data with four fingers flat.\n(6) This decision does not create any new standards; it is coherent with ICAO standards.\n(7) In accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark did not take part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application. However, given that Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol, notified by letter of 13 October 2008 the transposition of this acquis in its national law. It is therefore bound under international law to implement this Decision.\n(8) In accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(4), the United Kingdom has not taken part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application as it constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom is therefore not an addressee of this Decision.\n(9) In accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland\u2019s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(5), Ireland has not taken part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application as it constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Ireland is therefore not an addressee of this Decision.\n(10) This Decision constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.\n(11) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters\u2019 association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(6), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(7).\n(12) As regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC\u00a0(8) on the conclusion of that Agreement on behalf of the European Community.\n(13) As regards Liechtenstein, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation\u2019s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC\u00a0(9) of 28 February 2008 on the signature, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of that Protocol.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 51(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)\u00a0(10),", "main_body": ["The specifications relating to the resolution and use of fingerprints for biometric identification and verification in the Visa Information System shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nJacques BARROT\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 60.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 213, 15.6.2004, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 267, 27.9.2006, p. 41.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 131 1.6.2000, p. 43.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 64, 7.3.2002, p. 20.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 10.7.1999, p. 36.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 10.7.1999, p. 31.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 53, 27.2.2008, p. 1.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 83, 26.3.2008, p. 3.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 381, 28.12.2006, p. 4.\nANNEX\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resolution of fingerprints\nThe Central Visa Information System (CS-VIS) shall receive fingerprint images of ten fingers flat of a nominal resolution only of 500 dpi (with an acceptable deviation of +/\u2013 5 dpi) with 256 grey levels.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use of ten fingerprints for biometric identifications and searches\nCS-VIS shall perform biometric searches (biometric identifications) with ten fingers flat.
