Information relating to other uses has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with the requirements of Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to fix certain maximum residue levels.\n(3) Where no Community maximum residue level or provisional MRL exists Member States shall establish a national provisional maximum residue level in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to fix certain maximum residue levels.\n(4) At the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the technical and scientific evaluation of kresoxim methyl was finalised on 16 October 1998 in the format of the Commission review report for kresoxim methyl. In this review report the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for kresoxim methyl was set at 0,4 mg/kg of body weight. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with kresoxim methyl has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(10) and it has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed in this Directive do not give rise to an exceeding of this ADI.\n(5) Acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an acute reference dose were not noted during the evaluation and discussion that preceded the inclusion of kresoxim methyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(6) For certain agricultural products the use conditions for kresoxim methyl were already defined in a manner which permits the establishing of definitive maximum residue levels.\n(7) To ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination for all those products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. The setting at Community level of such provisional maximum residue levels does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for kresoxim methyl in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and in accordance with Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC in particular Part B, Section 2.4.2.3 to this Annex. Four years is considered a sufficient period of time during which to establish most further uses of kresoxim methyl. After that period these provisional maximum residue levels should become definitive;\n(8) The Community's trading partners have been consulted aobut the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels have been considered. The possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the submission of acceptable data.\n(9) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.\n(10) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The following is added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:\n\">TABLE>\"", "The following is added to Part of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC:\n\">TABLE>\"", "The maximum residue levels for kresoxim methyl in the Annex to this Directive are added to Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC.", "1. Where the maximum residue levels for kresoxim methyl are indicated as \"(p)\", this means that they are provisional (p) in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n2.
