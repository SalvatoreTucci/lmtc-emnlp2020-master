Background\n(1)  In September 1994, following a review, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No  2271/94  (2), amended the definitive countervailing duty imposed on imports of ball bearings with a  greatest external diameter not exceeding 30 mm, originating in Thailand but exported to the  Community from another country, from 6,7  % to 5,3  %.\n(2)  The 6,7  % countervailing duty had been imposed in July 1993 by Regulation (EEC) No 1781/93   (3), following a review of Commission Decision 90/266/EEC  (4), accepting an undertaking offered by  the Royal Thai Government, in connection with the countervailing duty proceeding concerning imports  of the abovementioned ball bearings. This involved the Royal Thai Government levying an export tax  to offset the subsidies granted. No countervailing duty was imposed at the time of adoption of this  Decision. The review investigation revealed, however, that a duty was necessary in order to prevent  indirect imports into the Community avoiding the export tax levied by the Royal Thai Government on  direct imports and to safeguard the effectiveness of the undertaking.\n(3)  The amended definitive duty rate of 5,3  % on indirect imports, posed by Regulation (EC) No  2271/94, was based on the revised rate of export tax of 0,72 baht per piece, as determined by  Decision 94/639/EC  (5), following a further review.\nB.  Reopening of investigation\n(4)  In December 1994, the Commission initiated a review of  Decision 94/639/EC and of Regulation (EC) No 2271/94, by a notice published in the Official Journal  of the European Communities (6).\n(5)  The purpose of this review was to recalculate the amount of subsidy granted by the Royal Thai  Government, with a view to allowing a modification of the rate of export tax established by  Decision 94/639/EC. Since the rate of countervailing duty on indirect imports directly reflects the  export tax rate, the review also covers Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 imposing the definitive duty.\n(6)  The Commission officially advised the Royal Thai Government, the exporters and importers known  to be concerned, as well as the complainant in the original investigation (Febma) and gave the  parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and request a  hearing. The Royal Thai Government, the exporters located in Thailand and the Community producers,  represented by Febma, made their views known in writing.\n(7)  The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes  of a determination and carried out an investigation at the premises of the following:\n(a)  Royal Thai Government:\nDepartment of Foreign Trade, Bangkok,\nBoard of Investment, Bangkok;\n(b)  Thai exporters:\nNMB Thai Ltd, Ayutthaya, Thailand,\nPelmec Thai Ltd, Bang Pa-In, Thailand,\nNMB Hi-Tech Ltd, Bang Pa-In, Thailand.\nAll these exporting companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mineba Co., Ltd., Japan.\n(8)  Upon request, parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of  which it was intended to recommend the amendment to the rate of definitive countervailing duty.  They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.\nThe written comments submitted by the parties were, where appropriate, taken into consideration.\nC.  Recalculation of subsidy amount\n(9)  It has been determined that the countervailable  subsidies granted to the exporters in Thailand in the period 1 October 1993 to 31 March 1994 ('the  investigation period`) amount to 0,66 baht per piece. The Royal Thai Government has accordingly  amended the export tax rate on ball bearings exported directly to the Community to 0,66 baht per  piece, and has offered a modified version of the undertaking to this effect. Ths has been accepted  by Commission Decision 95/180/EC  (1), which also explains in detail the reasoning with regard to  the calculation of the amount of subsidy.\nD.  Injury and Community interest\n(10)  No new evidence was supplied with regard to injury or  Community interest. The Council therefore maintains its conclusions set out in Regulation (EC) No  2271/94 concerning these matters.\nE.  Amendments to definitive duty\n(11)  In view of the change in the export tax rate from 0,72 to  0,66 baht per piece, the rate of definitive countervailing duty on indirect imports should be  amended accordingly to an amount equivalent to the new export tax rate. When expressed as a  percentage of the net, free-at-Community-frontier, price of the product, the new rate of  countervailing duty amounts to 4,8  %.\nF.  Collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties\n(12)  As explained in recital (12) of  Regulation (EC) No 2271/94, the countervailing duty should continue to be collected in addition to  the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2934/90  (2).\nThe combined amount of anti-dumping and countervailing duty to be collected in this case is,  therefore, 11,5  % (6,7  % anti-dumping duty plus 4,8  % countervailing duty).\nThe basis for calculating the amount of both anti-dumping and countervailing duty should be the  same net, free-at-Community-frontier, price of the product,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 shall be replaced by the  following:\n'Article 1  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1781/93 shall be replaced by the following:\n\"2.
