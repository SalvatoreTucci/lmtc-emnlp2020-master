In Chapter II, the following point is inserted:\n'7. For electronic recording equipment which is equipment operating by signals transmitted electrically from the distance and speed sensor, any interruption exceeding 100 milliseconds in the power supply of the recording equipment (except lighting), in the power supply of the distance and speed sensor and any interruption in the signal lead to the distance and speed sensor.'\n2. In Chapter III under '(a) General points', point 1.3 is replaced by the following:\n'1.3 A means of marking showing on the record sheet individually:\n- each opening of the case containing that sheet,\n- for electronic recording equipment, as defined in point 7 of Chapter II, any interruption exceeding 100 milliseconds in the power supply of the recording equipment (except lighting), not later than at switching-on the power supply again,\n- for electronic recording equipment, as defined in point 7 of Chapter II, any interruption exceeding 100 milliseconds in the power supply of the distance and speed sensor and any interruption in the signal lead to the distance and speed sensor.'\n3. In Chapter III under '(c) Recording instruments', point 4.1 is replaced by the following:\n'4.1 Recording equipment must be so constructed that the period of driving time is always recorded automatically and that it is possible, through the operation where necessary of a switch device to record separately the other periods of time as indicated in Article 15 (3), second indent (b), (c) and (d) of the Regulation.'", "As from 1 July 1991 Member States shall no longer grant EEC approval to any type of recording equipment which does not comply with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85, as amended by this Regulation.", "As from 1 January 1996 the recording equipment of any new vehicle brought into service for the first time shall comply with Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85, as amended by this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 November 1990.\nFor the Commission\nKarel VAN MIERT\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 370, 31. 12. 1985, p. 8."}
