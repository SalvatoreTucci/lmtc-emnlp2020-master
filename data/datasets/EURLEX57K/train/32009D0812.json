From 1 July 2012, the frequency band 2\u00a0400-2\u00a0483,5\u00a0MHz will be made available entirely for wideband data transmission systems and radio determination applications, in accordance with Decision 2006/771/EC.\n(5) By letter of 29 June 2009, France officially asked the Commission for a transitional period during which wideband data transmission systems and radio determination applications could be used in the 2\u00a0454-2\u00a0483,5\u00a0MHz sub-band on its territory solely subject to the following conditions. Outside buildings, these devices may only be used with a power limited to 10\u00a0mW. However, inside buildings, they may be used with the maximum power authorised by Decision 2006/771/EC, as amended by Decision 2009/381/EC, that is to say 100\u00a0mW e.i.r.p. for wideband data transmission systems and 25\u00a0mW e.i.r.p. for radio determination applications. Wideband data transmission systems and radio determination applications may be used in the 2\u00a0400-2\u00a0454\u00a0MHz sub-band subject to the conditions laid down in Decision 2006/771/EC.\n(6) In support of its request, France has provided sufficient information and technical justifications demonstrating that there is a risk of interference with military equipment.\n(7) A report on the development of the situation in France would be beneficial for the smooth progress of the transitional period.\n(8) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee indicated at their meeting on 8 July 2009 that they did not object to this transitional derogation.\n(9) The derogation requested would not unduly delay implementation of Commission Decision 2006/771/EC, as amended by Decision 2009/381/EC, or create disproportionate differences between Member States in terms of competition or regulation. There is sufficient justification for this derogation in view of the special situation in France, and full implementation of Decision 2006/771/EC should be facilitated there,", "main_body": ["France is hereby authorised to derogate from its obligations under Commission Decision 2006/771/EC, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Until 30 June 2012, France is hereby authorised to limit the power of wideband data transmission systems and radio determination applications in the 2\u00a0454-2\u00a0483,5\u00a0MHz sub-band in metropolitan France to 10\u00a0mW e.i.r.p. where the devices in question are used outside buildings, including places assimilated thereto such as an aircraft, in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to facilitate sharing with other services.", "By 31 December 2010, France shall submit a report to the Commission on the implementation of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 11.11.2006, p. 66.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 119, 14.5.2009, p. 32."}
