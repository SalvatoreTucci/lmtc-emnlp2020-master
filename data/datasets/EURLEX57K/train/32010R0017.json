Winsl. et al. until 31 March 2010.\n(3) Following observations regarding the presence of that harmful organism in certain parts of the Veneto region made by the Commission during an inspection in Italy from 31 August to 11 September 2009, Italy informed the Commission on 23 October 2009 of the results of the latest survey carried out in the Veneto region for the presence of that harmful organism in September and October 2009. The results of this latest survey show that in the province of Venice there are 14 places, in which that harmful organism has been occurring for a period of at least the last three successive years in spite of the eradication measures taken by the Italian authorities. Consequently, those measures have proved to be ineffective.\n(4) The latest survey results were discussed during the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 19-20 October 2009. It was concluded that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. has to be considered as established in the province of Venice. That province should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["In the second column of point 2 of heading (b) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 690/2008, the second indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 and, until 31 March 2010, Ireland, Italy (Ap\u00falia, Emilia-Romagna (the provinces of Parma and Piacenza), Lombardy (except the province of Mantua), Veneto (except the provinces of Rovigo and Venice, the communes Castelbaldo, Barbona, Piacenza d\u2019Adige, Vescovana, S.
