The second is to estimate production in time for making decisions. Only when such basis statistics are available, can forecasting be considered.\nThe results of this plan should fit into a framework which can be called an 'Advanced Agriculture information System'. In the pilot projects, emphasis will be placed upon remote sensing, but in operational use, this technique is seen as complementary to more conventional data. The semi-operational projects within the pilot project will test this kind of complementarity.\nWhile the development effort is planned to be extended over 10 years, this Decision considers in some detail only the first five years. During this period, the pilot project should already lead to an integration of new methods in the Community agricultural information system. Cereals and oil seeds, which are generally grown on flat terrain and large fields, will be considered first. When feasible, vineyards and olive trees will also be dealt with because of their economic importance.\nTaking into account priorities, methodologies to be developed and the requirements of satellite data, the plan has been organized in seven actions (Table 1). Actions 1 to 5 each correspond to a given operational objective Action 6 is support (ground surveys) necessary for all the actions. Action 7 consists of several long term studies, not connected with one particular operational objective.\nFor each action, specific methodology will be developed and development work will be undertaken in support of the semi-operational objective (Actions 1, 2, 4 and 5) or as the very core of the action (Actions 3 and 7): see Table 2.\nIn respect to the shift towards operational applications, the actions concern three different time schedules:\n- short-term (three to five years): Actions 1, 2 and 4,\n- medium-term (five to ten years): Actions 3 and 5\n- long-term (more than ten years): Action 7.\nThe costs of the project are summarized, for the next five years, in Table 3.\nTABLE 1\nOutline of the pilot project\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Action  // Main orientation  // Geographic localization  // Input  // Output  //  //  //  //  //  // 1.
