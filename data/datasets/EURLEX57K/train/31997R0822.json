DETERMINATION OF THE ISOTOPIC RATIO >NUM>18O\n>DEN>16O\nOF THE WATER CONTENT IN WINES\n\u00c9. DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD\n1. Method objective\nThe objective of the present method is to measure the isotopic ratio >NUM>18O\n>DEN>16O\nof waters of different origins. The isotopic ratio >NUM>18O\n>DEN>16O\ncan be expressed in deviation \u00e4 &permil; in ratio to the value of isotopic ratio of the international reference V.SMOW:\n\u00e4i [&permil;] = [ >NUM>Ri\n>DEN>RSMOW\n-1 ] \u00d7 1 000\n2. Principle\nThe isotopic ratio >NUM>18O\n>DEN>16O\nis determined by mass spectrometry of isotopic ratios (MSIR) from ionic currents m/z 46 (12C16O18O) and m/z 44 (12C16O2) produced by carbon dioxide obtained after an exchange with the water in wine according to the reaction:\nC16O2 + H218O  , . C16O18O + H216O\nThe carbon dioxide in the gaseous phase is used for analysis.\n3. Reagents\n- Carbon dioxide for analysis\n- SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water)\n- GISP (Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation)\n- SLAP (Standard Light Arctic Precipitation)\n- Reference water specific to the laboratory carefully standardized in relation to the reference sample of the International Agency of Atomic Energy in Vienna (IAEA).\n4. Laboratory equipment\n- mass spectrometer of isotopic ratios with an internal repeatability of 0,05 &permil;\n- triple collector for simultaneous recording of ions m/z 44, 45 and 46 or, by default, a double collector for measuring ions m/z 44 and 46\n- thermostated system (\u00b1 0,5 \u00b0C) to carry out the equilibration between CO2 and the water content in wine\n- vacuum pump able to reach an internal pressure of 0,13 Pa\n- phials for samples having 15 ml volume and a capillary annex tube with an interior diameter of about 0,015 mm\n- Eppendorf pipette with plastic throw-away cone.\n5. Experimental determinations\n5.1. Manual method\nOperational mode of the equilibration method\nIntroduction of the sample\n- Take the Eppendorf pipette at the fixed volume of 1,5 ml, adapt a cone and pump the liquid to be analysed in order to insert it in a balloon flask. Then, place silicon grease around the neck of the balloon flask and attach the balloon flask to the valve while verifying that it is tightly shut,\n- Repeat the operation for each balloon flask on the work ramp while introducing the laboratory's reference water into one of the balloons.\nDegasing of the ramp\nThe two ramps are cooled down with liquid nitrogen, then the whole system is purged up to 0,1 mm Hg by opening the valves.\nThen, shut the valves off and let it all heat up. The degasing cycle is repeated until there is no more pressure variation.\nEquilibration of the water and the CO2\nCool the work ramps to - 70 \u00b0C (Liquid nitrogen and alcohol mix) to freeze the water and put it all in a vacuum. After stabilization of the vacuum, isolate the ramp by actioning the valve and purge the CO2 introduction system. Insert the gaseous CO2 into the work ramp and, after having isolated it from the rest of the system, introduce the ramp in a thermostated bath at 25 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0,5 \u00b0C) for 12 hours (one night). To optimize the necessary time for equilibration, it is advisable to prepare the samples at the end of the day and let the balance settle overnight.\nTransfer of the CO2 exchanged in the measuring cells\nA sample holder which supports as many measuring cells as balloon flasks containing exchanged CO2 is adapted on the empty line next to the work ramp. The empty cells are carefully purged and the exchanged gases contained in the ballons are transferred one after the other, into the measuring cells which have been cooled by liquid nitrogen. Then the measuring cells are allowed to heat up at room temperature.\n5.2. Use of an automatic exchange apparatus\nIn order to carry out the equilibration, sample phials are filled with either 2 ml of wine or 2 ml of water (laboratory work reference) and cooled down to - 18 \u00b0C. The sample slides containing the frozen products are adapted to the equilibration system, and after having created a vacuum in the system, carbon dioxide is introduced at a pressure of 800 hPa.\nThe balance is reached at a temperature of 22 \u00b1 0,5 \u00b0C after a minimum period of five hours and with moderate agitation. Since the equilibration duration depends on the phial's geometry, the optimum duration should be determined first for the system used.\nCarbon dioxide contained in the phials is then transferred to the introduction chamber of the mass spectrometer by a capillary tube and the measurement is carried out according to a specific protocol for each kind of equipment.\n6. Calculation and expression of the results\nThe relative difference \u00e4' of the ratio intensities of ions m/z 46 and 44 (\n>NUM>\u00c946\n>DEN>\u00c944\n) between the sample and the reference is expressed in &permil; by means of the following equation:\n\u00e4' sample = [ >NUM>(\n>NUM>I46\n>DEN>I44\n) sample\n>DEN>(\n>NUM>I46\n>DEN>I44\n) reference\n-1 ] \u00d7 1 000\nThe 18\u00cf content of the sample compared to the reference V.SMOW on the V.SMOW/SLAP scale, is given by the relation:\n\u00e4' 18O = [ >NUM>\u00e4' sample - \u00e4' SMOW\n>DEN>\u00e4' SMOW - \u00e4' SLAP\n] \u00d7 55,5\nThe value accepted for SLAP is equal to - 55,5 &permil; compared to V.SMOW. The isotopic ratio of reference must be determined after each series of 10 measurements on unknown samples.\n7. Fidelity\n- the repeatability (r) is equal to 0,24 &permil;\n- the reproductibility (R) is equal to 0,50 &permil;."}
