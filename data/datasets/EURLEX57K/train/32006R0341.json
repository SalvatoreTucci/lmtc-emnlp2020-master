In its Recommendation 2003/670/EC of 19 September 2003 concerning the European schedule of occupational diseases\u00a0(5), the Commission recommended that Member States should ensure that all cases of occupational diseases are reported and should progressively make their statistics on occupational diseases compatible with the European schedule, in accordance with the work being done on the system of harmonising European statistics on occupational diseases. The Commission Communication of 11 March 2002 on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006\u00a0(6) underlines that the statistical information should cover not just recognised occupational accidents and illnesses, their causes and consequences, but should also introduce some quantifiable elements relating to working environment factors which are likely to cause the problems. Statistical data should also be available for emerging phenomena, like stress-related complaints or musculoskeletal problems.\n(4) It is also necessary to update the specification of the sample set out in Section 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 384/2005, in order to ensure that the sample available for analysis in the ad hoc module is as revealing as possible.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee,", "main_body": ["The detailed list of information to be collected in 2007 by the ad hoc module on accidents at work and work-related health problems, required for Section 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 384/2005, shall be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "In Section 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 384/2005, the point \u2018Sample\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Sample: The target age group for the sample for this module consists of persons aged 15 or more.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nJoaqu\u00edn ALMUNIA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 77, 14.3.1998, p. 3.
