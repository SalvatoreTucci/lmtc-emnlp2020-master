In that context it is appropriate to remove from active legislation those acts which no longer have real effect.\n(2) The following Directive and the following Decisions relating to the common fisheries policy have become obsolete, even though formally they are still in force:\n\u2014 Council Directive 83/515/EEC of 4 October 1983 concerning certain measures to adjust capacity in the fisheries sector\u00a0(1). That Directive has exhausted its effects since the provisions covering the subject matter are now incorporated in Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006\u00a0(2),\n\u2014 Council Decision 89/631/EEC of 27 November 1989 on a Community financial contribution towards expenditure incurred by Member States for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources\u00a0(3).

That Decision has exhausted its effects since it was intended to apply during a period which has already lapsed,\n\u2014 Council Decision 1999/386/EC of 7 June 1999 on the provisional application by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme\u00a0(7). That Decision has exhausted its effects since it refers to a transitional period which has already lapsed,\n\u2014 Council Decision 2001/179/EC of 26 February 2001 setting the terms for financial support to Guinea-Bissau in the fisheries sector\u00a0(8). That Decision has exhausted its effects since it was intended to apply during a period which has already lapsed,\n\u2014 Council Decision 2001/382/EC of 14 May 2001 on a Community financial contribution towards certain expenditure to implement certain management measures on highly migratory fish\u00a0(9).

That Decision has exhausted its effects since it related to eligible expenditure effected by Member States between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003 and the factual situation for which it was adopted has been accomplished. Furthermore, a new Council Decision 2004/465/EC was adopted to cover expenditure as from the year 2004\u00a0(11),\n\u2014 Council Decision 2004/662/EC of 24 September 2004 authorising the Kingdom of Spain to extend until 7 March 2005 the Agreement on mutual fishery relations with the Republic of South Africa\u00a0(12). That Decision has exhausted its effects since it covered a transitional period which has already lapsed,\n\u2014 Council Decision 2004/890/EC of 20 December 2004 on the withdrawal by the European Community from the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources in the Baltic Sea and Belts\u00a0(13). That Decision has exhausted its effects because the withdrawal by the Community was notified to the Depositary of that Convention,\n\u2014 Council Decision 2005/76/EC of 22 November 2004 on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the provisional application of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of The Comoros on fishing off The Comoros for the period from 28 February 2004 to 31 December 2004\u00a0(14).
