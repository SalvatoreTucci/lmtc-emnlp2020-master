The machinery concerned was designed in accordance with harmonised standard EN 474-1 \u2018Earth-moving machinery \u2014 Safety \u2014 Part 1: General requirements\u2019.\n(3) As a consequence, the harmonised standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 \u2018Earth-moving machinery \u2014 Safety \u2014 Part 1: General requirements\u2019, whose reference was first published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 November 2013\u00a0(3) was examined by the Commission together with the representatives of the committee established by Article 22 of Directive 2006/42/EC. It was concluded that the earth-moving machinery designed and manufactured according to the standard does not allow the driver to have sufficient visibility in order to operate the machinery without a risk for the driver or third persons.\n(4) As a result, the Commission concluded that the harmonised standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 fails to meet the essential health and safety requirements provided for in points 1.2.2 Control devices (visibility of danger zones during starting) and 3.2.1. Driving position (visibility during operations) of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC.\n(5) Taking into consideration the need to improve the safety aspects of standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 and pending a suitable revision of that standard, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 should be accompanied by an appropriate warning,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 \u2018Earth-moving machinery \u2014 Safety \u2014 Part 1: General requirements\u2019, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union with restriction as set out in the Annex.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0157, 9.6.2006, p.\u00a024.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0316, 14.11.2012, p.\u00a012.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0348, 28.11.2013, p.\u00a05.\nANNEX\nCOMMISSION COMMUNICATION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECTIVE 2006/42/EC\n(Publication of titles and references of harmonised standards under Union harmonisation legislation)\nESO\u00a0(1) Reference and title of the harmonised standard First publication OJ Reference of superseded standard Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of superseded standard\nCEN EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 28.11.2013 EN 474-1:2006+A3:2013 Date expired\nWarning: This publication does not concern clause 5.8.1 Visibility \u2014 Operator's field of view of this standard, the application of which does not confer a presumption of conformity to the essential health and safety requirements 1.2.2 and 3.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC.\nNote 1: Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal (\u2018dow\u2019), set by the European standardisation organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise.\nNote 2: The new (or amended) standard has the same scope as the superseded standard.
