The main issue addressed by the communication is the mortality of bees. Such mortalities have been reported in several countries in the world and also in the EU.\n(4) In 2009 the EFSA project \u2018Bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe\u2019 concluded that the surveillance systems in the EU are, in general, weak and that there is a lack of data at Member States level and a lack of comparable data at EU level.\n(5) The main actions Commission proposed were the appointment of an EU reference laboratory (EURL) for bee health and the launch of surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses supported for the technical aspects by the EURL, and co-financed by the Commission.\n(6) The first step has been already completed as the EURL for bee health has been appointed with Commission Regulation (EU) No 87/2011\u00a0(5) and it is operational since 1 April 2011 (ANSES \u2014 Sophia Antipolis \u2014 FR).\n(7) As requested by the Commission, the EURL for bee health has produced a technical document \u2018Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses\u2019 (available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/liveanimals/bees/bee_health_en.htm) providing guidance to Member States to elaborate their surveillance studies.\n(8) In order to improve the availability of data on bee health it is appropriate to assist and support certain surveillance studies in Member States on honeybee losses.\n(9) Member States were invited to send to the Commission their surveillance studies based on the technical document of the EURL for bee health by 30 September 2011.\n(10) 20 Member States have sent their proposals for the surveillance studies. These proposals are being technically and financially evaluated in order to assess their conformity with the technical document \u2018Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses\u2019. After the evaluation and selection process the rate of co-financing that will not exceed 70\u00a0% and the amount of the individual contribution to each Member State will be fixed by means of a subsequent Commission Decision.\n(11) The surveillance studies need to include controls on apiaries in the period preceding the winter followed by a visit after the winter. Another visit is planned during the summer. Therefore, depending on the design of the Member States programmes, the first visit is expected to be carried out before winter of 2012 while the second is expected to be carried out the following year. For this reason, it is opportune to consider the period of application of this Decision starting from 1 January 2012 until 30 June 2013.\n(12) It is appropriate to establish financing by the Union for the studies by allocating EUR 3\u00a0750\u00a0000.\n(13) This Decision constitutes a financing decision within the meaning of Article 75(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and Article 90 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contribution of the European Union for the implementation of the surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses action is set at EUR 3\u00a0750\u00a0000.
