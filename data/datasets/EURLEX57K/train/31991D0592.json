whereas these derogations are subject to approval, under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 14 (2) and must also comply with the conditions laid down in Annex IV, part A (24);\nWhereas in Greece, Italy and Portugal the growing of potatoes of certain North American varieties has been an established practice; whereas part of the supply of seed potatoes of these varieties has been ensured by imports from Canada;\nWhereas, by Decisions 86/120/EEC (3), 87/154/EEC (4) as amended by Decision 87/311/EEC (5), 88/176/EEC (6) as amended by Decision 88/496/EEC (7), 89/32/EEC (8) and 89/599/EEC (9), the Commission approved derogations based on the concept of 'areal  freedom', subject to certain technical conditions to prevent the risk of harmful organisms spreading; whereas that approval expired on 31 March 1989; whereas the Commission also provided that those derogations would provide for the opportunity to seek  confirmation of the proper functioning of the concept of 'areal freedom';\nWhereas Greece, Italy and Portugal have stated that they intend to provide for derogations for the next seed-potato marketing season;\nWhereas it is known that Canada is still not free from potato spindle tuber viroid or from Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas Canada has further developed its programme to eradicate these harmful organisms in the provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; whereas there are good reasons to believe that the programme to eradicate potato spindle tuber viroid has  become fully effective in those provinces, and that the programme to eradicate Corynebacterium sepedonicum has become fully effective in certain areas of these provinces; whereas there have been no findings of the disease on samples drawn from seed  potatoes imported pursuant to Decision 89/599/EEC; whereas, as a precaution, the areas in which the seed potatoes used for the production of the relevant lots were produced, and those in which the relevant lots themselves were produced, should no longer  be qualified as areas declared free from Corynebacterium sepedonicum; whereas it has not been established that there are sufficient elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom' and  therefore against the recognition of the provisions implemented there as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas it can therefore be established that there is no risk of the harmful organisms in question spreading, provided that the seed potatoes originate in areas declared, on scientific evidence, free from both potato spindle tuber viroid and from  Corynebacterium sepedonicum, and that certain improved special technical conditions are complied with; whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada makes all technical information available which is necessary to monitor the functioning of the  protective measures required under the aforementioned technical conditions and to assess the functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom';\nWhereas, therefore, the derogations provided for by Greece, Italy and Portugal should be approved for the next seed-potato marketing season, provided that they include the aforementioned conditions and without prejudice to Council Directive 66/403/EEC  (10), as last amended by Directive 91/127/EEC (11), and to Council Directive 70/457/EEC (12), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (13);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 89/599/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1 (1), the variety Atlantic is added to the list of varieties as follows,\n'in respect of the seed potatoes of the varieties Atlantic, Donna, Kennebec, Russet Burbank, Sebago and Shepody originating in Canada';\n2. in Article 1 (2), point (b) is replaced by the following text:\n'(b) the seed potatoes shall be certified officially as seed potatoes meeting at least the conditions laid down for the 'Foundation' category.
