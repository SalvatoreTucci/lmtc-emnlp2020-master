Definitive action\n1. Regulation (EEC) No 706/84 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2901/85 (3), imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of tube and pipe fittings of malleable cast iron originating in Spain and falling within heading No ex 73.20 of the Common Customs Tariff corresponding to Nimexe code 73.20-30.\nB. Review\n2. In connection with the accession of Spain to the European Communities, the Spanish Government has introduced, with effect from 1 January 1986, a new turnover tax system based on value added (Impuesto sobre el Valor A\u0102\u0105adido), which replaced the former cascade turnover tax system (Impuesto sobre el Tr\u0102\u0104fico de las Empresas y Recargos Provinciales).\nC. Repeal of definitive countervailing duty\n3. It is considered that as a result of the application of the new tax mentioned in paragraph 2, the refund of the indirect taxes on export corresponds to the indirect taxes borne by the product when destined for domestic consumption and therefore does not, in accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, constitute a subsidy. Under these circumstances, the definitive countervailing duty is no longer appropriate and, consequently, Regulation (EEC) No 706/84 should be repealed with effect from 1 January 1986.\n4. Under Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (5), importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid on goods released for free circulation in the Community since 1 January 1986,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 706/84 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply as from 1 January 1986.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 17 April 1986.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
