whereas these different procedures should be properly  coordinated;\nWhereas businesses, consumers and other interested parties should know whom to contact within the  Commission and the administrations of the individual Member States when a problem arises with  regard to the free movement of goods;\nWhereas the procedures established to implement this Decision should not involve the creation of  unnecessary new bureaucracy while ensuring that an effective balance is struck between safeguarding  the legitimate interests of the Member States and maintaining the free movement of goods within the  Community;\nWhereas, in the interests of transparency, there should be full and up-to-date information  available to all interested parties on the implementation of this Decision;\nWhereas the removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods is of fundamental importance to the  Community and whereas it is necessary for the Community to establish measures in this area to  achieve that objective; whereas this measure clearly complies with the principle of  proportionality, as a complement to the principle of subsidiarity, since it is confined to ensuring  awareness of cases where the application of non-harmonized national rules is liable to affect the  satisfactory operation of the internal market,", "main_body": ["Where a Member State takes steps to prevent the free movement or  placing on the market of a particular model or type of product lawfully produced or marketed in  another Member State, it shall notify the Commission accordingly where the direct or indirect  effect of the measure is:\n- a general ban on the goods,\n- a refusal to allow the goods to be placed on the market,\n- the modification of the model or type of product concerned before it can be placed or kept on the  market, or\n- withdrawal of the goods from the market.", "For the purpose of this Decision:\n- 'modification of the model or type of product' means any modification of one or more of the  product's characteristics as listed in the 'technical specification' definition given in Article 1  of Directive 83/189/EEC (1),\n- 'judicial decision' means any decision taken by a judicial body whose role it is to give a  ruling,\n- 'measure' means any measure other than a judicial decision.", "1.
