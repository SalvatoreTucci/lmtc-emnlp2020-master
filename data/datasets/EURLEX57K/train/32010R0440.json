Specifically the Union\u2019s capacity to build on the growth and innovation potential of SMEs will therefore be decisive for future prosperity of the Union. However, SMEs bear a disproportionate regulatory and administrative burden in comparison to larger businesses. Therefore it is appropriate to reduce the level of fees for SMEs.\n(8) It is appropriate for the identification of SMEs to follow the definitions set out in Commission Recommendation\u00a02003/361/EC of 6\u00a0May\u00a02003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises\u00a0(4).\n(9) The reduced fees for proposals for harmonised classification and labelling should be reviewed within 3 years after the entry into force of the Regulation with a view to reviewing or removing them if deemed necessary.\n(10) This Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible, since it has been possible to submit requests for use of alternative chemical names and proposals for harmonisation of classification and labelling of substances to the Agency since 20\u00a0January\u00a02009, date of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the levels, and rules for payment, of the fees levied by the European Chemicals Agency, hereinafter called the \u2018Agency\u2019, as provided for in Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01272/2008.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018SME\u2019 means a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise within the meaning of the Recommendation\u00a02003/361/EC;\n2. \u2018medium-sized enterprise\u2019 means a medium-sized enterprise within the meaning of the Recommendation\u00a02003/361/EC;\n3. \u2018small enterprise\u2019 means a small enterprise within the meaning of the Recommendation\u00a02003/361/EC;\n4. \u2018microenterprise\u2019 means a microenterprise within the meaning of the Recommendation\u00a02003/361/EC.\nCHAPTER II\nFEES", "Fees for request for use of an alternative chemical name\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall levy a fee as laid down in Annex\u00a0I for a request to use an alternative chemical name for a substance in up to 5 mixtures in accordance with Article\u00a024(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the applicant is an SME, the Agency shall levy a reduced fee, as set out in Annex\u00a0I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the use of the alternative chemical name of the substance in accordance with Article\u00a024(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 in additional mixtures, an additional fee shall be levied for up to 10 additional mixtures and the same additional fee shall be levied for every further 10 additional mixtures, as set out in Section\u00a03 of Annex\u00a0I.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The date on which the fee levied for a request is received by the Agency shall be considered to be the date of receipt of the request.", "Fees for submission of proposals for harmonised classification and labelling of a substance\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall levy a fee as laid down in Annex\u00a0II for submission of proposals for harmonisation of classification and labelling in accordance with Article\u00a037(3) of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01272/2008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the party making the proposal is an SME, the Agency shall levy a reduced fee, as set out in Annex II.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The date on which the fee levied for a proposal is received by the Agency shall be considered to be the date of receipt of the proposal.", "Reductions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A natural or legal person that claims to be entitled to a reduced fee under Article\u00a03 and 4 shall inform the Agency thereof at the time of submission of the request.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency may request, at any time, evidence that the conditions for a reduction of fees apply.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a natural or legal person that claims to be entitled to a reduction cannot demonstrate that it is entitled to such a reduction, the Agency shall levy the full fee.\nWhere a natural or legal person that claims to be entitled to a reduction has already paid a reduced fee, but cannot demonstrate that it is entitled to such a reduction, the Agency shall levy the balance of the full fee.\nCHAPTER III\nPAYMENTS", "Mode of payment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fees shall be paid in Euro.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Payments shall be made only after the Agency has issued an invoice.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Payments shall be made by means of a transfer to the bank account of the Agency.", "Identification of the payment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every payment must indicate the invoice number in the reference field.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the purpose of the payment cannot be established, the Agency shall set a deadline by which the payer must notify it in writing of the purpose of the payment.
