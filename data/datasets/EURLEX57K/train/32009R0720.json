For reasons of homogeneity, this notification should be made using the form made available to the Member States by the Commission.\n(3) Member States which do not reply to this request of the Commission by sending their notification in the due form and by the set deadline should be considered as bearing no interest costs during the reference period.\n(4) For the Member States which declare in their notification, that they did not bear any interest costs during the reference period because they did not have agricultural products in public storage during that period the interest rate to be used for financing the costs for funds to be mobilised by those Member States to buy in products should be clearly determined.\n(5) Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)\u00a0(3) has introduced a distinction between reference prices and intervention prices. It is, therefore, necessary to adjust certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 670/2009 of 24 July 2009 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards public intervention by invitation to tender for the purchase of durum wheat or paddy rice, and amending Regulations (EC) No 428/2008 and (EC) No 687/2008\u00a0(4) has introduced new rules concerning the physical inspection for rice. It is, therefore, necessary to adjust certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 884/2006.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) For reason of sound management of intervention measures involving public storage, the amendments related to the distinction between reference price and intervention price should apply from 1 October 2009, the starting date of the new accounting year.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, IV, VI, VII, X and XII to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nPoints 3 to 6 of the Annex shall apply from 1 October 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 August 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 23.6.2006, p. 35.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 22.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I, IV, VI, VII, X and XII to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 are amended as follows:\n1. in Annex I, point B.III.2, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n2.
