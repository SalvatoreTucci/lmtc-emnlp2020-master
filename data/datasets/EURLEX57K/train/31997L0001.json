whereas, however, its geographic distribution is not fully known at present;\nWhereas it is not currently possible to detect the disease during the incubation period;\nWhereas scientific knowledge on spongiform encephalopathies is constantly developing; whereas various scientific publications and reports from recognised international bodies such as the World Health Organization may provide new information;\nWhereas the emergence of a variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD-V) suggests the possible transmissibility of BSE to humans; whereas, however, the causal link between CJD-V and population exposure to the BSE contaminating agent has not yet been demonstrated;\nWhereas, according to currently available data, it has been possible to detect infectivity in the encephalon, the spinal cord and the eyes of bovine animals with BSE;\nWhereas it is recognised that the recommended inactivation methods cannot be used in the cosmetics sector for brain, spinal cord and eye extracts;\nWhereas the cosmetics industry has for several years been implementing the recommendations of governmental and international agencies concerning BSE; whereas on 22 April 1996 the European Federation of the Perfume, Cosmetics and Toiletries Industries (COLIPA) advised its members against using bovine tissues or extracts of bovine tissues derived from the encephalon, the spinal cord and the eyes; whereas ovine and caprine tissues and fluids from the encephalon, spinal cord and the eyes and ingredients derived therefrom are practically not used in cosmetic products;\nWhereas on 21 October 1994, 29 March, 11 April and 18 July 1996 the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology delivered opinions on the risk of using products of bovine origin liable to transmit the BSE contaminating agent;\nWhereas on 2 October 1996 the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology delivered an opinion to the effect that risks linked to the utilization in cosmetic products of bovine, ovine or caprine tissues and fluids from the encephalon, spinal cord or eyes and ingredients derived therefrom cannot be excluded;\nWhereas experience has shown that sheep scrapie does not present a hazard for humans; whereas, however, recent data have shown that the BSE agent can be transmitted to sheep; whereas it is therefore necessary to take into account the fact that the transmissibility spectrum of the BSE agent is greater than that of sheep scrapie;\nWhereas it is necessary to take measures to ensure the health and safety of consumers without awaiting irrefutable scientific proof of the causal link between BSE and CJD or its variant;\nWhereas, therefore, it is prudent to ban provisionally the marketing of certain ingredients of bovine, ovine and caprine origin in cosmetic products;\nWhereas this Directive must be reviewed when all the above-mentioned elements have been examined, at the latest two years after implementation of the measures listed in the Annex;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in the cosmetic products sector,", "main_body": ["Directive 76/786/EEC is hereby amended as shown in the Annex hereto.", "Member States shall take all the necessary measures to ensure that as from 30 June 1997 cosmetic products containing the substances set out in the Annex shall not be placed on the market.", "At the latest two years after the date of entry into force of the Directive the Commission shall propose a possible amendment to this Directive in the light of the development of scientific knowledge.", "1.
