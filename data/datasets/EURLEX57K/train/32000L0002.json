Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 74/150/EEC applicable to systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 75/322/EEC.\n(2) Directive 75/322/EEC contains the earliest measures endeavouring to bring about a basic electromagnetic compatibility regarding radio interference. Subsequently, technical progress has increased the complexity and diversity of electrical and electronic equipment.\n(3) To take account of the increasing concern about the technological developments in electrical and electronic equipment and the need to ensure the general compatibility of different electrical and electronic equipment, Council Directive 89/336/EEC(4), as last amended by Directive 93/68/EEC(5), laid down general provisions regarding electromagnetic compatibility for all products not covered by a specific directive.\n(4) Directive 89/336/EEC established the principle that, in so far as protection requirements specified in that Directive were harmonised, its general provisions would not apply or would cease to apply with regard to apparatus covered by specified directives.\n(5) Directive 75/322/EEC should become such a specific directive.\n(6) The adaptation to technical progress was effected, in the case of motor vehicles, by Commission Directive 95/54/EC(6) relating to the suppression of radio interference produced by spark-ignition engines fitted to motor vehicles. Equivalent requirements must now be adopted on the suppression of radio interference produced by engines fitted to agricultural or forestry tractors, by establishing a specific directive within the framework of the type-approval procedure which provides for approvals granted by designated national authorities on the basis of harmonised technical requirements.\n(7) From 1 October 2001 the technical requirements relating to the radio interference (electromagnetic compatibility) of vehicles, their components and systems should be governed solely by the provisions of Directive 75/322/EEC.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 12 of Directive 74/150/EEC,", "main_body": ["Directive 75/322/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
