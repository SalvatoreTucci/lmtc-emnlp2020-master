The initial budgetary commitment shall be based on an indicative financial plan; this commitment shall be made for one year.\n4. The commitment will be made when the decision approving assistance is adopted by the Standing Committee on Plant Health under the procedure mentioned in Article 16a of Council Directive 77/93/EEC (1).\n5. Following commitment a first advance of not more than 60 % of the amount committed may be made.\n6. The balance of the amount committed is paid as two equal payments, each of 20 % of the total amount committed. The first part of the balance is paid upon presentation to the Commission of an interim report of activity. The second and final part of  the balance is paid upon presentation to the Commission of the detailed total expenditure made and of the final report activity.\nAuthorities responsible for the implementation of the programme\n- Central administration:\nInstituto de Protec\u00e7ao da Produ\u00e7ao\nAgro-Alimentar (IPPAA)\nCentro Nacional de Protec\u00e7ao da Produ\u00e7ao Agr\u00edcola (CNPPA)\nQuinta do Marqu\u00eas\nP-2580 Oeiras\n- Local administration:\nRegiao Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira\nSecretaria Regional da Agricultura, Florestas e Pescas\nDirec\u00e7ao Regional da Agricultura\nAv.

In cases of dispute the Commission shall examine the case within the partnership framework, asking Portugal or the other authorities designated by Portugal for implementation of the measure to submit their comments within two months.\n14. The Commission may reduce or suspend aid for a measure if the examination confirms the existence of an irregularity, in particular of a substantial modification affecting the nature or conditions of implementation of the measure for which approval  by the Commission has not been sought.\nRecovery of undue payments\n15. All sums unduly paid must be reimbursed to the Commission by the designated authority indicated in point 8. Interest may be levied on sums not reimbursed.

Continuous monitoring means an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the operational programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators  structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realization.\n3. Continuous assessment of an operational programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and  programme objectives.\nImplementation report and scrutiny of operational programmes\n4. Portugal shall notify to the Commission, within three months of adoption of the operational programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the annual implementation report. Three months after its appointment this  authority shall present to the Commission a proposal for standard presentation of implementation reports.\nThe annual report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission and to the Standing Committee on Plant Health before 31 August 1994. On the basis of the information therein Portugal will be able if appropriate  to apply for a new programme for future years.\n5. The Commission may jointly with Portugal call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3 above. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or  measures, modification of the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken.  To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will not pay the entire cost of employing him.\nIII. Retrospective assessment of economic impact\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished). A first assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact should be made  on the basis of the indicators agreed.\nC. Information and publicity\nIn the framework of this programme, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicized.\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n- make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\nPortugal and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures  adopted, either by an annual report or through the Monitoring Committee.\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\nII.
