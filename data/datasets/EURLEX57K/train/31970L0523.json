(2)OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 32/62. (3)OJ No C 51, 29.4.1970, p. 4. (4)OJ No C 108, 26.8.1970, p. 20.\n(b) pursuit of the occupation for a reasonable period of time in the country whence the person concerned comes, such period being in the sufficiently recent past to ensure that such person possesses professional knowledge equivalent to that required of the host country's own nationals;\nWhereas the main purpose of the measures provided for in this Directive will disappear once the co-ordination of conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question and the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal evidence of qualifications has been achieved;", "main_body": ["1. Member States, acting in accordance with the provisions hereinafter laid down, shall adopt the following transitional measures in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons or companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes (hereinafter called \"beneficiaries\") wishing to engage in the activities of self-employed persons referred to in paragraph 2.\n2. The activities in question are those covered by the Council Directive (1) of 30 November 1970 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in the wholesale coal trade and of activities of intermediaries in the coal trade (ISIC ex Group 6112).", "Where, in a Member State, the taking up of activity as an importer of coal from another Member State is subject to the condition that the applicant shall have sold, over a specified period, a minimum tonnage of coal in the territory of the host Member State, that Member State shall accept as sufficient qualification the fact that the person concerned has, over a corresponding period, acting either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, sold a like quantity of coal in his country of origin or in the country whence he comes.", "Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is dependent on the possession of general, commercial, or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for three years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, on condition that, unless the host Member State allows a longer interruption of professional activity on the part of its own nationals, such activity shall not have ceased more than two years before the date when the application provided for in Article 4 (2) is made.", "1. A person shall be regarded as having pursued an activity in a managerial capacity within the meaning of Articles 2 and 3 if he has pursued such activity in an undertaking in the field in question:    (a) as manager of an undertaking or manager of a branch of an undertaking ; or\n(b) as deputy to the proprietor or to the manager of an undertaking, where such post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented ; or\n(c) in a managerial post with duties of a commercial nature and responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking.\n2. Proof that the conditions laid down in Article 2 or in Article 3 are satisfied shall be established by certificates issued by the competent authority or body in the country whence the person concerned comes, which such person shall submit in support of his application for authorisation to pursue the activity in question in the host country.\n3. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 6, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the certificates referred to in paragraph 2 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.", "The provisions of this Directive shall remain applicable until the entry into force of provisions relating to the coordination of national rules concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question.
