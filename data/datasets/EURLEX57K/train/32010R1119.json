Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) The preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 was authorised as a feed additive for 10 years for use on sows by Commission Regulation (EC) 896/2009\u00a0(3). In accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC, it was authorised without a time limit for use on weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(4), on cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 492/2006\u00a0(5) and on dairy cows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007\u00a0(6). That additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 as a feed additive for dairy cows and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use on horses, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019. The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 22 June 2010\u00a0(7) concerning the use as a feed additive for dairy cows that, under the proposed conditions of use, Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment, and that it has a potential to increase milk production in dairy cows. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 22 June 2010\u00a0(8) concerning the use as a feed additive for horses that the use of that preparation can improve the apparent fibre digestibility in the target species.\n(6) The assessment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) 1831/2003, the provisions on Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 contained in Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007 should be deleted.\n(8) Since the modifications on the conditions of the authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the premixtures and compound feed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007, Article 1 and Annex I are deleted.", "Premixtures and compound feed containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 labelled in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC may continue to be placed on the market and used until stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 29.9.2009, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 195, 27.7.2005, p. 6.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 89, 28.3.2006, p. 6.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 335, 20.12.2007, p. 17.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(7):1662.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(7):1659.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
