Furthermore, seed and planting stock produced from this seed should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question.\n(6) Other Member States should furthermore be authorised to permit, in their territory, the marketing of seed and planting stock produced from this seed as defined in Directive 1999/105/EC which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of identification and labelling, if the marketing of such material has been authorised in the other Member States under this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The marketing in the Community of seed intended for the production of planting stock of Cedrus libani and Pinus brutia which does not satisfy the requirements in respect of identification and labelling laid down in Article 13 and 14 of Directive 1999/105/EC shall be permitted, until 31 May 2005, in accordance with the requirements set out in the Annexes to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The marketing of planting stock produced from the abovementioned seed is authorised within the Community until 31 May 2010, provided that requirements as set out in Annex II to this Decision are fulfilled.\nFor the purposes of this Decision, definitions as laid down in Article 2 of Council Directive 1999/105/EC shall apply.", "Any supplier wishing to place on the market the seed referred to in Article 1 shall apply for authorisation to the Member State in which he is established or importing.
