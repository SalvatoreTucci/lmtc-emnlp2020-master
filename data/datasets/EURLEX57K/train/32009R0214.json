Commission Regulation (EC) No 1800/2004\u00a0(3) authorised that additive for 10 years for use for chickens for fattening, turkeys and rabbits for fattening. That additive was notified as an existing product in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Since all the information required under that provision was submitted, that additive was entered into the Community Register of Feed Additives.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the holder of the authorisation and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority. Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA, holder of the authorisation of Cycostat 66G, has submitted an application with which it requests changing the conditions of the authorisation as regards chickens for fattening and turkeys by modifying the trade name from Cycostat 66G to Robenz 66G, leaving the trade name Cycostat 66G unchanged with respect to rabbits for fattening.\n(3) The proposed change of the terms of the authorisation is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additives concerned. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(4) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the new trade name of \u2018Robenz 66G\u2019, it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisation as regards chickens for fattening and turkeys.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01800/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01800/2004 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Existing stocks which are in conformity with the provisions applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation may continue to be placed\u00a0on the market and used until 30\u00a0June 2010.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 16.10.2004, p. 37.\nANNEX\nRegistration number of additive Name and registration number of person responsible for putting additives into circulation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff\nCoccidiostats and other medicinal substances\nAdditive composition:\nRobenidine hydrochloride: 66\u00a0g/kg\nLignosulfonate: 40\u00a0g/kg\nCalcium sulfate dihydrate: 894\u00a0g/kg\nActive substance:\nRobenidine hydrochloride, C15H13Cl2N5\u0387HCl, 1,3-bis [(p-chlorobenzylidene) amino]-guanidine hydrochloride,\nCAS number: 25875-50-7,\nRelated impurities:\nN,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032-Tris[(p-Cl-benzylidene)amino]guanidine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%\nBis-[4-Cl-benzylidene]hydrazine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%\nAdditive composition:\nRobenidine hydrochloride: 66\u00a0g/kg\nLignosulfonate: 40\u00a0g/kg\nCalcium sulfate dihydrate: 894\u00a0g/kg\nActive substance:\nRobenidine hydrochloride, C15H13Cl2N5\u0387HCl, 1,3-bis [(p-chlorobenzylidene) amino]-guanidine hydrochloride,\nCAS number: 25875-50-7,\nRelated impurities:\nN,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032-Tris[(p-Cl-benzylidene)amino]guanidine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%\nBis-[4-Cl-benzylidene]hydrazine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%\nAdditive composition:\nRobenidine hydrochloride: 66\u00a0g/kg\nLignosulfonate: 40\u00a0g/kg\nCalcium sulfate dihydrate: 894\u00a0g/kg\nActive substance:\nRobenidine hydrochloride, C15H13Cl2N5\u0387HCl, 1,3-bis [(pchlorobenzylidene) amino]-guanidine hydrochloride,\nCAS number: 25875-50-7,\nRelated impurities:\nN,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032-Tris[(p-Cl-benzylidene)amino]guanidine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%\nBis-[4-Cl-benzylidene]hydrazine: \u2264\u00a00,5\u00a0%"}
