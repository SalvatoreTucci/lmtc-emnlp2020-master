In view of recent market developments, and in particular the fact that fewer live adult bovine animals are marketed in the Member States and that Member States therefore no longer have representative markets for these animals, the communication to the Commission of prices of adult bovine animals is no longer considered necessary in order to monitor developments in the beef market. Nevertheless, Member States may communicate such prices recorded on their representative markets.\n(2) To monitor the Community market for categories of bovine animals other than adult bovines, provision should be made for a survey of prices for male calves between eight days and four weeks, for male store cattle and for slaughter calves. Detailed rules on the information to be provided for the price survey for each of these bovine animal categories should be established.\n(3) The price recorded on the representative markets of the Community may be taken as the average of the prices of the bovine animals in question on the representative market or markets of each Member State. This average should be weighted in accordance with the coefficients expressing the relative size of the cattle population of each Member State for each category marketed in a reference period.\n(4) The representative market or markets for each Member State should be selected on the basis of experience in recent years. Where there is more than one representative market in a Member State account should be taken of the arithmetic average of the quotations recorded on these markets.\n(5) Member States may, because of veterinary or health protection regulations, find it necessary to take measures which affect quotations. In such circumstances, it is not always suitable when recording market prices to take into account quotations which do not reflect the normal trend of the market. Consequently, certain criteria should be laid down allowing the Commission to take account of that situation.\n(6) Provision should be made for the communication to the Commission of the weekly prices, through electronic means of transmission to be agreed upon by the Commission.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2705/98 should accordingly be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1. The average Community price, per head, of male calves between eight days and four weeks old shall be the average of the prices of those bovine animals, weighted by the coefficients laid down in Annex I, Part A, recorded on the main markets of the Member States representative of this type of production.
