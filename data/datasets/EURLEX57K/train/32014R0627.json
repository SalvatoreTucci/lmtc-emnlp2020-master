However, it also results from that review that it is appropriate to defer the date of implementation of those DPF performance requirements in order to provide an adequate lead time to industry for ensuring the availability of the equipment in terms of mass production and its adaptation to the vehicles. It is therefore necessary to adapt Table 1 of Appendix 9 to Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 582/2011, in order to include the new date of implementation.\n(3) In addition, and in the case of positive ignition engines, Table 1 of Appendix 9 to Annex I to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0582/2011 should also be adapted by inserting a column referring to the requirement of monitoring the levels of carbon monoxide against the OTLs set out in Table 2 of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 582/2011, as well as a column referring to the in-use performance requirements set out in points 6. to 6.5.5.1 of Annex X to that Regulation.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 4, paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Type-approvals granted to compression ignition engines and vehicles in accordance with Character B in Table 1 of Appendix 9 to Annex I before the date of application of this Regulation, shall remain valid after that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0188, 18.7.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing and amending Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with respect to emissions from heavy duty vehicles (Euro VI) and amending Annexes I and III to Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0167, 25.6.2011, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nTable 1 of Appendix 9 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Table 1\nCharacter NOx OTL\u00a0(1) PM OTL\u00a0(2) CO OTL\u00a0(6) IUPR Reagent quality and consumption Implementation dates: new types Implementation dates: all vehicles Last date of registration\nA Row \u201cphase-in period\u201d of Table 1 or Table 2 Performance monitoring\u00a0(3)  Phase-in\u00a0(7) Phase in\u00a0(4) 31.12.2012 31.12.2013 31.8.2015\u00a0(9)\nB\u00a0(11) Row \u201cphase-in period\u201d of Table 2  Row \u201cphase-in period\u201d of Table 2 Phase-in\u00a0(7) Phase in\u00a0(4) 1.9.2014 1.9.2015 30.12.2016\nC Row \u201cgeneral requirements\u201d of Table 1 or Table 2 Row \u201cgeneral requirements\u201d of Table 1 Row \u201cgeneral requirements\u201d of Table 2 General\u00a0(8) General\u00a0(5) 31.12.2015 31.12.2016\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNOx OTL\u201d monitoring requirements as set out in Table 1 and 2 of Annex X.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPM OTL\u201d monitoring requirements as set out in Table 1 of Annex X.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPerformance monitoring\u201d requirements as set out in point 2.1.1 of Annex X.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Reagent quality and consumption \u201cphase-in\u201d requirements as set out in points 7.1.1.1 and 8.4.1.1 of Annex XIII.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Reagent quality and consumption \u201cgeneral\u201d requirements as set out in points 7.1.1 and 8.4.1 of Annex XIII.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCO OTL\u201d monitoring requirements as set out in Table 2 of Annex X.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0IUPR \u201cPhase-in\u201d requirements as set out in points 6.4.4, 6.5.5 and 6.5.5.1 of Annex X.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0IUPR \u201cGeneral\u201d requirements as set out in Section 6 of Annex X.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0For positive-ignition engines and vehicles equipped with such engines.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0For compression-ignition engines and vehicles equipped with such engines.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0Only applicable to positive-ignition engines and vehicles equipped with such engines.\u2019"}
