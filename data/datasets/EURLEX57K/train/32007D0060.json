In view of the characteristics inherent in the trans-European transport network, the stress must be on the delegation of technical tasks, the main aim being to strengthen the links between the trans-European transport network and the communities of experts.\n(6) The agency must mobilise a high level of expertise in accordance with the objectives defined by the Commission, and under its supervision. The setting up of the agency must also make it possible to optimise the implementation of the trans-European transport network by making it easier to recruit staff specialised in matters relating to the trans-European transport network.\n(7) The setting-up of the agency must increase flexibility in the implementation of Community action in the field of the trans-European transport network. The agency's annual work programme must enable it in particular to contribute to the achievement of the annual priorities for the implementation of the trans-European transport network, as planned and agreed by the Commission. The agency must also ensure better coordination of funds with other Community instruments.\n(8) Management based on the results obtained by the agency, with the establishment of the necessary procedures and supervision and coordination circuits, must enable the Commission to simplify the arrangements for the implementation of the trans-European transport network. The Commission will be able to capitalise on the technical work carried out by the agency by developing in parallel, in an appropriate manner, tasks which involve making policy judgments.\n(9) Cooperation between the agency and the Commission and the accomplishment of its specific tasks must make it possible to raise the profile of Community action in the field of the trans-European transport network.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are consistent with the opinion of the Committee of the Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Setting up the agency\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An executive agency (hereinafter \u2018the Agency\u2019) is hereby set up for the management of Community action in the field of the trans-European transport network, the status of which is governed by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be known as the \u2018Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency\u2019.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Brussels.", "Duration\nThe Agency shall be set up for a period starting on 1 November 2006 and ending on 31 December 2008.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be responsible, in the framework of Community action in the field of the trans-European transport network, for the implementation of tasks concerning the granting of Community financial aid pursuant to Regulation No 2236/95 of the Council\u00a0(2), excluding programming, the establishment of priorities, programme evaluation, the adoption of financing decisions and legislative monitoring.
