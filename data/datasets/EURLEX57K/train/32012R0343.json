Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\u00a0(3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(4).\n(5) The third subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1359/2007 of 21 November 2007 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals\u00a0(5) provides for a reduction of the special refund if the quantity of cuts of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95\u00a0%, but not less than 85\u00a0%, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.\n(6) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 257/2012\u00a0(6). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.\n(7) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(8) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of
