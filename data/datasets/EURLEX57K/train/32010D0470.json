It includes requirements for trade in semen, ova and embryos of animals of the equine, ovine and caprine species and in ova and embryos of animals of the porcine species (\u2018the commodities\u2019). In addition, it provides for health certificates to be established for trade in the commodities within the Union.\n(2) Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 176/2010\u00a0(2), sets out certain new requirements for the commodities which are to apply from 1 September 2010.\n(3) Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC, as thus amended by Regulation (EU) No 176/2010, introduces rules concerning semen storage centres and detailed conditions for their approval and supervision. It also sets out detailed conditions for the approval and supervision of embryo collection and production teams, for the collection and processing of in vivo derived embryos and the production and processing of in vitro fertilised embryos and micromanipulated embryos. Annex D, as thus amended, also amended the conditions to be applied to the donor animals of semen, ova and embryos of animals of the equine, ovine and caprine species and of ova and embryos of porcine species.\n(4) It is necessary to establish new model health certificates for trade within the Union of the commodities taking into account the animal health requirements set out in Annex\u00a0D to Directive 92/65/EEC, as amended by Regulation (EU) No 176/2010.\n(5) In addition, provision should be made for existing stocks of commodities in the Union that comply with the provisions of Directive 92/65/EEC established prior to the entry into force of the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) No 176/2010. Accordingly, it is necessary to set out separate model health certificates for trade within the Union in semen, ova and embryos of animals of the equine, ovine and caprine species and trade in ova and embryos of animals of the porcine species collected or produced, processed and stored in accordance with Annex\u00a0D to Directive 92/65/EEC prior to 1 September 2010.\n(6) The long lasting stocking capabilities for such commodities make it impossible at present to fix a date for the exhaustion of the existing stocks. Therefore, it is not possible to fix a date for the termination of the use of those model health certificates for the existing stocks.\n(7) In the interests of consistency and simplification of Union legislation, the model health certificates should be set out in a single decision and take account of Commission Regulation (EC) No 599/2004 of 30 March 2004 concerning the adoption of a harmonised model certificate and inspection report linked to intra-Community trade in animals and products of animal origin\u00a0(3).\n(8) In order to ensure full traceability of the commodities, model health certificates should be set out in this Decision for trade within the Union in semen of animals of the equine, ovine and caprine species collected in approved semen collection centres and dispatched from an approved semen storage centre, whether or not the latter constitutes part of a semen collection centre approved under a different approval number.\n(9) In the interests of clarity of Union legislation, the Union acts setting out model health certificates for trade within the Union in the commodities concerned should be expressly repealed. Accordingly, Commission Decision 95/294/EC of 24 July 1995 determining the specimen animal health certificate for trade in ova and embryos of the equine species\u00a0(4), Commission Decision 95/307/EC of 24 July 1995 determining the specimen animal health certificate for trade in semen of the equine species\u00a0(5), Commission Decision 95/388/EC of 19 September 1995 determining the specimen certificate for intra-Community trade in semen, ova and embryos of the ovine and caprine species\u00a0(6) and Commission Decision 95/483/EC of 9 November 1995 determining the specimen certificate for intra-Community trade in ova and embryos of swine\u00a0(7) should be repealed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Decision lays down model health certificates for trade within the Union in the following commodities:\n(a) semen of animals of the equine
