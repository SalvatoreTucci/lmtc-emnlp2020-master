However, the FCS will maintain a complete link to vessels contained in groupings and these vessels are further linked to their license or registration information and the declared catch on the certificate.\nThe grouping feature will be used for some product forms and, in particular, for fisheries using collector vessels which purchase from several fishing vessels and issue records of sales at sea, for non-vessel fisheries such as beach seine, beach clams, ice fishing, for some inshore fisheries, and for aboriginal fisheries where fisheries may occur at the community level. Groupings will be export company-specific and will be modified for each shipment, as required.\nThe grouping feature will enable Canada to produce a single certificate per shipment while keeping all the information behind the certificate (vessel license/registration) available in the database.\nThis information will be available to EU Member States authorities in importing countries through our website or through direct telephone line to our certificate office.\nThird parties countries may also contact the certificate office for information on indirect exports.\nSection 6\nFAROE ISLANDS\nCATCH CERTIFICATION SCHEME\nIn accordance with Article 12(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the catch certificate provided for in Article 12 and Annex II to that Regulation shall be replaced \u2014 for fisheries products obtained from catches made by fishing vessels flying the Faroese flag \u2014 by the Faroese catch certificate based on the Faroese system of sales notes and logbooks which is a traceability system under the control of the Faroese authorities ensuring the same level of control by authorities as required under the EU catch certification scheme.\nA specimen of the Faroese catch certificate, which shall replace the European Community Catch Certificates and Re-export Certificate as from 1 January 2010, is given in the Appendix.\nDocuments referred to in Article 14(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 may be communicated by electronic means.\nMUTUAL ASSISTANCE\nMutual assistance pursuant to Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 shall be developed to facilitate the exchange of information and assistance between respective competent authorities of the Faroe Islands and Member States of the European Union, based on detailed rules on mutual assistance laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1010/2009.\nAppendix"}
