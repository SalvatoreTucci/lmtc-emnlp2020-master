The prohibition of certain other substances for the manufacture of food supplements and foodstuffs in general may be justified on grounds of the protection of health and life of humans within the meaning of Article 30 EC Treaty.\n(12) Since the latter article provides for an exception, to be interpreted strictly, to the rule of free movement of goods within the Community, it is for the national authorities which invoke it to show in each case, in the light of national nutritional habits and in the light of the results of international scientific research, that their rules are necessary to give effective protection to the interests referred to in that provision and, in particular, that the marketing of the products in question poses a real risk to public health.\n(13) The Czech authorities have not provided any evidence that would justify the establishment of a list containing prohibited substances to be used in the manufacture of food supplements and foodstuffs in general.\n(14) Even if such evidence were provided, the draft Decree does not contain any provision ensuring the free movement of food supplements and foodstuffs in general lawfully produced and/or marketed in other Member States which contain substances not permitted thereby.\n(15) Therefore, the draft Decree fails to provide adequate guarantees that the rights of the economic operators deriving from Articles\u00a028 and 30 of the EC Treaty.\n(16) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article\u00a012(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01925/2006.\n(17) The Czech authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft Decree in question and modify it in accordance with Articles\u00a028 and 30 of the EC Treaty taking into account the observations of the Commission in its negative opinion.\n(18) The measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Czech Republic is required to refrain from adopting its draft Decree laying down requirements for food supplements and the enrichment of foodstuffs, unless it is amended in accordance with Paragraph 2.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Czech Republic is required to amend the draft Decree at issue in order to include a clear reference as to the treatment of products which do not comply with the requirements of the notified draft, but are lawfully produced and/or marketed in other EU Member States, Turkey or EEA States.", "This Decision is addressed to the Czech Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 26."}
