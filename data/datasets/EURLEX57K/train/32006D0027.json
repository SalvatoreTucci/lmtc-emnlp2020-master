It also provides for a list of certain veterinary medicinal products for which provisional maximum residue limits have been fixed. Those products could be present in meat from equidae.\n(4) The latest Community inspection visit to Mexico has revealed serious shortcomings in the capacity of the Mexican authorities to carry out reliable checks of meat of equidae, in particular to detect substances prohibited by Directive 96/22/EC.\n(5) That inspection also revealed serious shortcomings as regards controls of the market in veterinary medicines, including non-authorised products. Those shortcomings enable prohibited substances to be used easily in horse-meat production. Those substances could therefore be present in the meat and meat products of equidae intended for human consumption. The presence of those substances in food presents a potential serious risk for human health.\n(6) Member States should carry out the appropriate controls on meat and meat products of equidae imported from Mexico on arrival at the Community border in order to prevent such meat and meat products of equidae that are unfit for human consumption from being placed on the market.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 sets up the rapid alert system, which should be used to implement the mutual information requirement provided for in Article 22(2) of Directive 97/78/EC. In addition, Member States will keep the Commission informed through periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of meat and meat products of equidae from Mexico.\n(8) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by the competent Mexican authorities and on the basis of the results of the tests carried out by Member States.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Decision shall apply to meat and meat products of equidae imported from Mexico and intended for human consumption (meat and meat products of equidae).", "Official controls\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall, using appropriate sampling plans and detection methods, ensure in accordance with Directive 96/22/EC that each consignment of meat and meat products of equidae undergoes hazard-based official controls in particular for the presence of certain substances having a hormonal action and beta-agonists used for growth promotion purposes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall submit to the Commission every three months a report of all analytical results of official controls on consignments of products covered by paragraph 1.
