Those areas are listed in the table set out in the Annex to that Decision.\n(2) Following a confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in Romania, that Member State took protection measures pursuant to Decision 2006/415/EC, including the establishment of areas A and B, as provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.\n(3) Commission Decision 2010/158/EU of 16 March 2010 concerning certain interim protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in poultry in Romania\u00a0(6) was adopted following an outbreak of that disease in Romania. That Decision defines the areas within which the protection measures provided for in Decision 2006/415/EC are to apply and the period of application of those measures.\n(4) Those interim protective measures have now been reviewed within the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(5) A further outbreak has been confirmed since the adoption of Decision 2010/158/EU within an area already subject to the interim protective measures thereof.
