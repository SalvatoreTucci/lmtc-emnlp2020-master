As a result, the Community requested authorisation to suspend the application to the USA of its obligations under GATT 1994 and the AD Agreement.\n(5) In February 2002, the Community agreed to suspend the arbitration on its request, on the express understanding that a bill was pending in the US Congress to repeal the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 and to terminate the on-going cases before US Courts.\n(6) The Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 has yet to be repealed, and claims brought under this Act are pending before US Courts against persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States.\n(7) These judicial proceedings are causing substantial litigation costs and may ultimately result in a judgment awarding treble damages.\n(8) By its maintenance and application, the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 impedes the attainment of the aforementioned objectives, affects the established legal order and has adverse effects on the interests of the Community and the interests of natural and legal persons exercising rights under the Treaty.\n(9) Under these exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to take action at Community level to protect the interests of the natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States, in particular by removing, neutralising, blocking or otherwise counteracting the effects of the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916,", "main_body": ["No judgment of a court or tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located in the United States of America giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 or to actions based thereon or resulting therefrom, shall be recognised or be enforceable in any manner.", "1.
