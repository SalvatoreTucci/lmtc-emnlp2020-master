Those territories are authorised to export to the Community de-boned and matured fresh meat of domestic bovine animals, of domestic sheep and goats, and of certain farmed and wild non-domestic animals (fresh meat).\n(4) On 20 October 2008, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was suspected in a farm located in the district of Ghanzi, situated in the veterinary disease control zone 12 of Botswana. That veterinary disease control zone is at present authorised to export fresh meat to the Community. As soon as the outbreak was confirmed, the competent authority in Botswana suspended exports of fresh meat to the Community.\n(5) In view of these circumstances, imports into the Community of fresh meat from the veterinary disease control zone 12 of Botswana should no longer be authorised. Considering that the competent authority in Botswana has provided sufficient guarantees regarding the measures put in place to control the spread of the disease and considering that the affected areas are completely fenced it is appropriate to limit that restriction to veterinary disease control zone 12 only.\n(6) The description of the territory BR-1 of Brazil excludes from the territories authorised to export fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat into the Community an area called the \u2018high surveillance zone\u2019. This consists of a strip of 15 km along the border with Paraguay that covers a number of municipalities, including Caracol and Ant\u00f4nio Jo\u00e3o that were not included. It is therefore opportune to add these two municipalities to the description of the \u2018high surveillance zone\u2019 in the territory BR-1.\n(7) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body":
