Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes and certain existing tariff quotas should be extended, while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.\n(2) Since the quota amount for certain Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of Community industry for the current quota period, these tariff quotas should be increased with effect from 1 January 2005.\n(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2005 for certain products on which duties were suspended in 2004. These products should therefore be removed from the table in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.\n(4) In view of the many changes to be made, the full text of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should be replaced in the interests of clarity.\n(5) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities on the role of national parliaments in the European Union.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 is replaced by the Annex hereto.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 30 June 2005, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96:\n\u2014 the validity of tariff quota 09.2021 shall expire on 30 June 2005; its volume shall remain unaltered,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2613 is fixed at 400 tonnes at a 0\u00a0% rate of duty.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2005, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96:\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2023 is fixed at 700\u00a0000 units,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2603 is fixed at 3\u00a0400 tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2612 is fixed at 500 tonnes at a 0\u00a0% rate of duties,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2619 is fixed at 80 tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2620 is fixed at 500\u00a0000 units,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2621 is fixed at 1\u00a0500 tonnes and its period of validity shall expire on 31 December 2005,\n\u2014 the quota amount of tariff quota 09.2985 is fixed at 300\u00a0000 units and its period of validity shall expire on 31 December 2005.", "The tariff quotas 09.2605, 09.2606, 09.2607, 09.2609, 09.2614, 09.2918, 09.2957, 09.2966, 09.2993 and 09.2999 shall be closed from 31 December 2004.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
