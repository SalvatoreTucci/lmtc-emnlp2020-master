Those statements of objection were deemed admissible under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(4) The abovementioned statements of objection stressed, in particular, that registering the name in question would jeopardise the existence of names, trade marks or products which had been marketed legally for at least five years before the publication date provided for in Article 6(2), and that the name proposed for registration was generic.\n(5) By letter of 20 March 2013 the Commission asked the interested parties to hold appropriate consultations.\n(6) Agreement was reached between the United Kingdom and the objecting parties within the stipulated three-month period and notified to the Commission on 8 July 2013.\n(7) It emerges from the abovementioned consultations that the objecting parties\u2019 main concern is the status of the one word \u2018Cheddar\u2019 in the composite name \u2018Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar\u2019. However, the protection sought by the producer relates only to the said composite name as a whole.
