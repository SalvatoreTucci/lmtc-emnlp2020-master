In view of the availability of some of these pesticides on the world market it is prudent to set Maximum Residue Levels for all products at the Lower Limit of Analytical Determination. Some mercuric compounds cannot be distinguished from mercuric compounds originating from environmental contamination.\n(2) Where no legal use of a pesticide is allowed and where no residues can be tolerated it is appropriate that the MRL established at the appropriate lower limit of analytical determination on fresh produce, apply also on the composite and processed products.\n(3) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants have been taken into account, in particular its advice and recommendations concerning the methodology to be followed for the protection of consumers of agricultural products treated with pesticides.\n(4) Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following rows are added:\n\">TABLE>\"", "In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are added:\n\">TABLE>\"", "In part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are added:\n\">TABLE>\"", "The maximum residue levels listed in the Annex to this Directive are added to those listed in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC for the pesticides in question.", "1.
