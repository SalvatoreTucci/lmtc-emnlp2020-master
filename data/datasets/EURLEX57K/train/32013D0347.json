That Directive also lays down certain preventive measures aimed at increasing awareness and preparedness of the competent authorities and the farming community for foot-and-mouth disease.

That Directive also lays down the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds and the early detection of possible spread of avian influenza viruses to mammals. Directive 2005/94/EC provides, inter alia, that Member States are to draw up a contingency plan in accordance with Annex X thereto, specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza.\n(5) Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 of 24 September 2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing\u00a0(5) lays down rules for the killing of animals bred or kept for the production of food, wool, skin, fur or other products as well as the killing of animals for the purposes of depopulation and for related operations.
