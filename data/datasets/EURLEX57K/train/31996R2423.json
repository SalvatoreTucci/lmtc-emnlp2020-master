The following paragraph is added after paragraph 2:\n'3. Should the purchase referred to in Article 1 (1) involve a castrated male bovine animal, payment of the full price referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conditional on no application for a deseasonalization premium as referred to in Article 4c of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 having been made for the animal that was sold.\nThe producer or his agent shall undertake to ensure that this premium is not sought for the animal in question.\nShould this undertaking not be given, the amount of the price to be paid in accordance with paragraph 1 for the animal in question shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable amount of the deseasonalization premium. Should an application for this premium be presented for this animal, the producer concerned shall be obliged to refund out of the price received for the animal an amount equal to the applicable deseasonalization premium. In these two cases, the rate of the Community contribution provided for in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable deseasonalization premium.`\n2.
