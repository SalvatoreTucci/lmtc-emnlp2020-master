Furthermore, since the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 referring to sectors cannot apply to products to which no specific sector has been assigned, Annex III to the said Regulation should be amended so as to specify a sector for every product covered by any of the different arrangements.\n(3) It proved impossible to adopt the first decision envisaged in Article 12(5) of the abovementioned Regulation before 1 January 2003; it is therefore appropriate to provide that the removal of tariff preferences should apply, in two stages, from 1 November 2003 and 1 May 2004.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) 2501/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
