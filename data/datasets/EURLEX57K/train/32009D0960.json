In accordance with that Decision, imported consignments have to be transported to the plant of destination under strict channelling conditions, in order to prevent potential risks to public and animal health.\n(4) The Czech Republic has submitted a request for the authorisation of imports of photographic gelatine from those third countries to an establishment on its territory. The Czech Republic has confirmed that the strict channelling conditions under Decision 2004/407/EC will be applied in order to prevent potential health risks.\n(5) Accordingly, and pending the review of the technical requirements for the import of animal by-products under the revised Animal by-products Regulation\u00a0(3) the Czech Republic should be allowed to authorise the importation of photographic gelatine subject to compliance with the conditions set out in Decision 2004/407/EC.
