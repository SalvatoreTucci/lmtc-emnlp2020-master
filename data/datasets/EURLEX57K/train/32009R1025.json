The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as the Authority.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission and to deliver an opinion on a health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from Elvir SAS, submitted on 30 July 2008 pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of a dairy product enriched with milk peptide and magnesium on the reduction of anxiety (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-476)\u00a0(2). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018This product helps moderate signs of anxiety in mildly stress-sensitive adults due to its milk peptide and magnesium content\u2019.\n(6) On 19 December 2008, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship was not established between the consumption of the constituents proposed to exert the claimed effect and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.\n(7) Following an application from Unilever plc (UK) and Unilever NV (Netherlands) submitted on 7 July 2008, pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of black tea from Camellia Sinensis on help to focus attention (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-434)\u00a0(3). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Black tea helps you to focus attention\u2019.\n(8) On the 22 December 2008 the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship was not established between the consumption of black tea from Camellia Sinensis and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.\n(9) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission, pursuant to article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(10) The health claims \u2018This product helps moderate signs of anxiety in mildly stress-sensitive adults due to its milk peptide and magnesium content\u2019, and \u2018Black tea helps you to focus attention\u2019 are health claims as referred to in Article 13(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Therefore they are both subject to the transition measures laid down in Article 28(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. However, as the applications were not made before 19 January 2008, the requirement provided for in Article 28(6)(b) is not fulfilled and the transition period laid down in that Article is not applicable. Accordingly, a transition period of 6 months should be provided for, to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Health claims set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall not be included in the Community list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.\nHowever, the health claims set out in the Annex to this Regulation may continue to be used for 6 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0404, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 905, 1-10.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 906, 1-10.\nANNEX\nREJECTED HEALTH CLAIMS\nApplication \u2014 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Dairy product enriched with milk peptide and magnesium This product helps moderate signs of anxiety in mildly stress-sensitive adults due to its milk peptide and magnesium content Q-2008-476\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Black tea from Camellia Sinensis Black tea helps you to focus attention Q-2008-434"}
