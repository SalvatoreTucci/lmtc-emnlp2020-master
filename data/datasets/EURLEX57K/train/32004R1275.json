To prevent any distortion of competition, the fall in the intervention price must be taken into account when determining the amount of the subsidy applicable to exports of rice covered by subsidy documents issued during the previous marketing year but still valid at the beginning of the 2004/05 marketing year. To that end, Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2692/89 should provide for that to be taken into account.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 2692/89 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1878/2003\u00a0(3) opened an invitation to tender for the subsidy on consignments of husked long-grain B rice to R\u00e9union.\n(5) The time limit for this procedure should be extended to 29 July.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2692/89 are hereby replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the validity of the subsidy document referred to in Article 13 extends beyond the end of the marketing year and where export takes place during the following marketing year, the amount of the subsidy resulting from the procedure provided for in Article 9 shall be adjusted where necessary by subtracting the difference between the intervention price for paddy rice in the previous and the new marketing year, exclusive of any monthly increase.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The adjustment provided for in paragraph 2 shall take account of the conversion rates specified in Article 1 of Regulation No 467/67/EEC.
