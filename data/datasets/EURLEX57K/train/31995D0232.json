In the case of seed of varietal associations of swede rape and turnip rape, Member States  participating in the experiment are also released from the provisions of Article 2 (1) (c) of  Directive 69/208/EEC in so far as they require that seed shall belong to a variety included in the  common catalogue of varieties or national catalogue of varieties, and from the provisions of  Article 8 of Directive 69/208/EEC, in so far as they relate to the homogeneity of the lots.", "1.

Conditions to be satisfied by the crop:\n(a) the crop shall be raised in a production ground where five years have elapsed since plants of  cruciferae were last grown;\n(b) where a male-sterile component is used for seed production; male sterility shall be at least 98   %. The level of male sterility shall be assessed by examining flowers for the absence of fertile  anthers;\n(c) the distance from neighbouring sources of pollen which may result in undesirable foreign  pollination shall be at least 500 m for the production of basic seed and at leasts 300 m for the  production of certified seed. These distances can be disregarded if there is sufficient protection  from any undesirable foreign pollination;\n(d) the number of field inspections shall be at least three. The first inspection should be made  before the flowering stage, the second inspection at the early flowering stage and the third  inspection at the end of the flowering stage.\n2.  Conditions to be satisfied by the seed:\n(a) the seed shall have sufficient identity and purity as regards the varietal characteristics of  its components, including restoration of male sterility or, as the case may be, fertility;\n(b) the minimum varietal purity shall confirm to the following standards:\n>TABLE>\nThe minimum varietal purity shall be examined mainly in field inspections carried out in accordance  with point 1.\n3.  Seed shall not be certified as certified seed unless due account has been taken of the results  of official post-control plot tests on samples of basic seed taken officially and carried out  during the growing season of the seed entered for certification as certified seed to ascertain  whether the basic seed has met the requirements for basic seed laid down in this Decision in  respect of identity and purity as regards the characteristics of the components, including male  sterility.\nIn the case of basic seed of hybrids, the varietal purity may be assessed, not by post-control plot  tests but by appropriate biochemical methods. The conditions under which such tests are carried out  may be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 of Directive  69/208/EEC.\n4.  In the case of certified seed of a varietal association, the seed of the 'pollinator-dependent  hybrid` and of the 'pollinator(s)` shall be mechanically combined in proportions jointly determined  by the persons responsible for the maintenance of those components. The seed of the female and male  components shall be dressed using different coloured seed dressings.\n5.  The standards in respect of the minimum varietal purity laid down in the table under point 2 in  respect of certified seed of hybrids shall be monitored by official post-control tests on samples  taken officially.\nIn the case of certified seed of hybrids, the varietal purity may be assessed, not by post-control  plo tests but by appropriate biochemical methods. The conditions under which such tests are carried  out may be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 of Directive  69/208/EEC.\n6.  The requirements for the label shall be as follows:\n(a) in the case of basic and certified seed of hybrids, the labelling provisions set out in Annex  IV to Directive 69/208/EEC shall apply;\n(b) in the case of basic seed of hybrids or inbred lines -  where the hybrid or the inbred line to which the basic seed belongs has been officially accepted  under Directive 70/457/EEC, the name of this component, under which it has been officially  accepted, with or without reference to the final variety, accompanied, in the case of hybrids or  inbred lines as component for final variety, by the word 'component`,\n-  in other cases, the name of the component to which the basic seed belongs, which may be given in  code form, accompanied by a reference to the final variety, with or without reference to its  functions (male or female), and accompanied by the word 'component`;\nc) in the case of certified seed to be combined in accordance with point 4, the labelling  provisions set out in Annex IV to Directive 69/208/EEC shall apply to the certified seed of each  component. Moreover, its function (female or male), accompanied by the word 'component` and the  name of the final variety associations shall be given;\n(d) in the case of certified seed of a varietal association, the labelling provisions set out in  Annex IV of Directive 69/208/EEC shall apply, except that instead of the name of the variety, the  name of the varietal association shall be given (information 'varietal association` and its name)  and the percentages by number of the various components shown by variety shall be given; it shall  be sufficient to give the name of the varietal association if the percentage by number has been  notified in writing to the purchaser, on request, and officially recorded.\nThe label shall be blue with a diagonal green line;\n(e) The label shall bear the number of this Decision after the words 'EC rules and standards`;\n(f) where a Member State participates in the experiment, samples supplied by that Member State for  Community comparative trials shall derive from seed lots officially certified following this  experiment."}
