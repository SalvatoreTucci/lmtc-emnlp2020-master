Entries concerning those consignments should be therefore included in the list.\n(5) The list should also be amended to decrease the intensity of official controls of the commodities for which the available information indicates an overall improvement of compliance with the relevant requirements provided for in Union legislation and for which the current frequency of official controls is therefore no longer justified. The entries in the list concerning aubergines and bitter melon from Dominican Republic, spices from India and Yardlong beans, aubergines and Brassica vegetables from Thailand, should be therefore amended accordingly.\n(6) The list should also be amended by deleting the entries for commodities for which available information indicates an overall satisfactory degree of compliance with the relevant safety requirements provided for in Union legislation and for which an increased control frequency is therefore no longer justified. The entries in the list concerning peaches from Egypt, feed additives and premixtures from India and Capsicum annuum from Peru should be therefore deleted.\n(7) With a view to better targeting certain products set out in the list, TARIC codes have to be added, where appropriate. Amendment of certain CN codes is also necessary to align with the revised Combined Nomenclature applying as of 1 January 2013.\n(8) In the interest of consistency and clarity of Union legislation, it is appropriate to replace Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 11.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFeed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) TARIC sub-division Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks\nDried grapes 0806\u00a020  Afghanistan (AF) Ochratoxin A 50\n(Food)\nHazelnuts 0802\u00a021\u00a000;
