As yet, a comprehensive settlement has not been reached.\n(2) The Council of 26 April 2004, considering that the Turkish Cypriot community had expressed their clear desire for a future within the European Union, recommended that the funds earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement should be used to put an end to the isolation of that community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities and with the EU.\n(3) Following the accession of Cyprus, the application of the acquis is suspended pursuant to Article 1(1) of Protocol No 10 of the Act of Accession 2003 in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the areas\u2019).\n(4) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Protocol No 10, nothing in the Protocol precludes measures with a view to promoting the economic development of the areas.\n(5) Measures to be financed under this Regulation are of an exceptional and transitional nature and are intended, in particular, to prepare and facilitate, as appropriate, the full application of the acquis communautaire in the areas following a solution to the Cyprus problem.\n(6) With a view to allocating the financial support in the most efficient and rapid way, it is desirable to provide that assistance can be supplied directly to the beneficiaries.\n(7) In order to supply assistance in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, the Commission should be in a position to delegate to the European Agency for Reconstruction implementation of assistance under this Regulation. Therefore, Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction\u00a0(1) needs to be amended accordingly.\n(8) The development and restructuring of infrastructure, in particular in the areas of energy and transport, the environment, telecommunications and water supply should take account of island-wide planning, where appropriate.\n(9) In the implementation of actions financed under this Regulation, the rights of natural and legal persons, including the rights to possessions and property, should be respected.\n(10) Nothing in this Regulation is intended to imply recognition of any public authority in the areas other than the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.\n(11) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(2), measures for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted by use of the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.\n(12) Implementing this Regulation contributes, as set out above, to the achievement of Community objectives, but the Treaty provides for no powers, other than those referred to in Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["Overall Objective and Beneficiaries\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall provide assistance to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island, on improving contacts between the two communities and with the EU, and on preparation for the acquis communautaire.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assistance shall benefit inter alia local bodies, cooperatives and representatives of civil society, in particular organisations of the social partners, business support organisations, bodies carrying out functions in the general interest in the areas, local or traditional communities, associations, foundations, non-profit organisations, non-governmental organisations, and natural and legal persons.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The granting of such assistance shall not imply recognition of any public authority in the areas other than the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.", "Objectives\nAssistance shall be used to support inter alia:\n\u2014 the promotion of social and economic development including restructuring, in particular concerning rural development, human resources development and regional development,\n\u2014 the development and restructuring of infrastructure, in particular in the areas of energy and transport, the environment, telecommunications and water supply,\n\u2014 reconciliation, confidence building measures, and support to civil society,\n\u2014 bringing the Turkish Cypriot community closer to the Union, through inter alia information on the European Union\u2019s political and legal order, promotion of people to people contacts and Community scholarships,\n\u2014 preparation of legal texts aligned with the acquis communautaire for the purpose of these being immediately applicable upon the entry into force of a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem,\n\u2014 preparation for implementation of the acquis communautaire in view of the withdrawal of its suspension in accordance with Article 1 of Protocol No 10 to the Act of Accession.", "Management of Assistance\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be responsible for administering the assistance.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89\u00a0(3), composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall give its opinion on draft financing decisions, where they are in excess of EUR 5 million.
