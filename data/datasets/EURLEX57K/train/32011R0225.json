Annex IV to that Regulation lists for each of the scheduled substances of categories 2 and 3 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 111/2005, the countries for which a pre-export notification is required. The lists involve third countries which have requested to receive pre-export notifications in accordance with Article 12(10) of the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1988.\n(2) The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs has, at its second meeting, on 8 March 2010, decided to include phenylacetic acid in Table I of the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1988. Article 12(10) of that Convention sets out that each Party from whose territory a substance in Table I is to be exported shall ensure that, prior to such export, information on the export consignment is supplied by its competent authorities to the competent authorities of the importing country.\n(3) Following the decision to include phenylacetic acid in Table I of the United Nations Convention, it is necessary to amend Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1277/2005 to ensure that pre-export notifications are sent for all exports of phenylacetic acid from the European Union.\n(4) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1277/2005 does not list all third countries which have requested to receive pre-export notifications for certain scheduled substances of categories 2 and 3 since the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 297/2009\u00a0(3).
