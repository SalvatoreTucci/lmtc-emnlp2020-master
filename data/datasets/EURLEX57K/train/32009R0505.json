The quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation should therefore be imported before 30 June 2009. However, this reallocation also involves the transfer of quantities from the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009. Therefore the flexibility of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 should also apply to the quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation.\n(8) In accordance with Article 153(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, import licences for sugar for refining are to be issued only to full-time refiners provided that the quantities concerned do not exceed the quantities that may be imported in the framework of the traditional supply need referred to in Article 153(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. However, pursuant to Article 155 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the Commission may adopt measures derogating from Article 153(3) of that Regulation in order to ensure that the ACP/Indian sugar is imported into the Community under the conditions set out in ACP Protocol and the Agreement with India. For the delivery period starting on 1 July 2009 and taken into account the price reduction of imported raw cane sugar on 1 October 2009, those conditions can only be fulfilled if all traders can have access to import licences for sugar for refining. It is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 which limits the submission of applications for sugar for refining to full-time refiners.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The delivery obligations for imports originating in the countries that are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India in respect of products falling within CN code 1701, expressed in tonnes of white-sugar equivalent, in the 2008/2009 delivery period and the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009 for each exporting country concerned, are hereby adjusted as shown in the Annex.", "By way of derogation from Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, Article 14(1) of that Regulation shall apply to the quantity reallocated pursuant to this Regulation and imported after 30 June 2009.", "For the delivery obligations of the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009 and by way of derogation from Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 950/2006, all applicants fulfilling the conditions of Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006\u00a0(5) may submit applications for import licences for sugar for refining in the Member State in which they are registered for VAT purposes.", "Regulations (EC) No 403/2008 and (EC) No 1088/2008 are repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0178, 1.7.2006, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0120, 7.5.2008, p.\u00a06.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0297, 6.11.2008, p.\u00a012.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0238, 1.9.2006, p.\u00a013.\nANNEX\nDelivery obligations for imports of preferential sugar originating in countries which are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India for the 2008/2009 delivery period, expressed in tonnes of white-sugar equivalent:\nACP Protocol/India Agreement signatory country Delivery obligations 2008/2009\nBarbados 25\u00a0491,36\nBelize 72\u00a0069,06\nCongo 5\u00a0213,50\nC\u00f4te-d\u2019Ivoire 10\u00a0695,41\nFiji 169\u00a0837,06\nGuyana 166\u00a0683,92\nIndia 10\u00a0485,19\nJamaica 101\u00a0765,52\nKenya 4\u00a0979,51\nMadagascar 10\u00a0766,70\nMalawi 44\u00a0331,43\nMauritius 456\u00a0811,21\nMozambique 22\u00a0517,62\nUganda 0,00\nSaint Kitts and Nevis 0,00\nSuriname 0,00\nSwaziland 171\u00a0933,98\nTanzania 0,00\nTrinidad and Tobago 12\u00a0265,90\nZambia 25\u00a0322,72\nZimbabwe 56\u00a0685,68\nTotal 1\u00a0367\u00a0855,75\nDelivery obligations for imports of preferential sugar originating in countries which are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India for the delivery period beginning on 1 July 2009, expressed in tonnes of white-sugar equivalent:\nACP Protocol/India Agreement signatory country Delivery obligations for the period beginning on 1 July 2009\nBarbados 8\u00a0024,35\nBelize 11\u00a0670,03\nCongo 2\u00a0546,53\nC\u00f4te-d\u2019Ivoire 2\u00a0546,53\nFiji 41\u00a0337,08\nGuyana 41\u00a0282,85\nIndia 2\u00a0500,00\nJamaica 30\u00a0558,58\nKenya 1\u00a0250,00\nMadagascar 2\u00a0690,00\nMalawi 5\u00a0206,10\nMauritius 122\u00a0757,63\nMozambique 1\u00a0500,00\nUganda 0,00\nSaint Kitts and Nevis 0,00\nSuriname 0,00\nSwaziland 29\u00a0461,13\nTanzania 1\u00a0941,63\nTrinidad and Tobago 10\u00a0937,75\nZambia 1\u00a0803,75\nZimbabwe 7\u00a0556,20\nTotal 325\u00a0570,14"}
