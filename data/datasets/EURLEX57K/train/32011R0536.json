That Regulation provides that the commodities covered by it are only to be imported into and transited through the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto.\n(8) South Africa is listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as authorised for imports into the Union of breeding and productive ratites and of day-old chicks, hatching eggs and meat of ratites.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also sets out the conditions for a third country, territorry, zone or compartment to be considered as free from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and the requirements for the veterinary certification in that respect for commodities destined for imports into the Union.\n(10) South Africa has notified the Commission of an outbreak of HPAI of the H5N2 subtype that was confirmed on its territory on 9 April 2011.\n(11) Due to the confirmed outbreak of HPAI, the territory of South Africa can no longer be considered as free from that disease. As a consequence, the veterinary authorities of South Africa suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of the concerned commodities with immediate effect. The entry for South Africa in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) In addition, as a consequence of the HPAI outbreak, South Africa no longer complies with the animal health conditions for applying \u2018treatment A\u2019 to commodities consisting of, or containing meat of farmed ratites or treated stomachs, bladders and intestines of ratites for human consumption, listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC and for applying \u2018treatment E\u2019 to biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products consisting of, or containing meat of poultry, farmed feathered game, ratites and wild game birds, listed in Part 3 of that Annex. Those treatments are insufficient to eliminate animal health risks linked to those commodities. The entries for South Africa for those commodities in Parts 2 and 3 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC should therefore be amended, in order to provide for an adequate treatment thereof.\n(13) Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 June 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 74.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 30.11.2007, p. 49.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 226, 23.8.2008, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Part 2, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA South Africa (1) C C C A D D A C C A A D XXX\u2019\n(2) in Part 3, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA South Africa XXX XXX XXX XXX D D A XXX XXX A A D XXX\u2019\nSouth Africa ZA-1 E E XXX XXX D D A E XXX A A D\nANNEX II\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA \u2014 South Africa ZA-0 Whole country SPF\nEP, E       S4\u2019\nBPR I P2 9.4.2011  A\nDOR II\nHER III\nRAT VII P2 9.4.2011"}
