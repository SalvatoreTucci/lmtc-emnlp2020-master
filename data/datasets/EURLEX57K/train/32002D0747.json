The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of light bulbs that are produced with low environmental impact.\nAssessment and verification requirements\nThe specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion. Testing should be performed by appropriately accredited laboratories or laboratories that meet the general requirements expressed in standard EN ISO 17025 and are competent to perform the relevant tests.\nWhere the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses test reports or other evidence to the competent body assessing the application in order to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate. The competent body assessing the application may carry out independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes).\nCRITERIA\n1. Energy efficiency, lifetime, lumen maintenance and mercury content\nSingle-ended light bulbs shall meet the following requirements:\n>TABLE>\nDouble-ended light bulbs shall meet the following requirements:\n>TABLE>\nNote:\nEnergy efficiency is as defined in Annex IV of Commission Directive 98/11/EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75/EEC with regard to energy labelling of household lamps(1).\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the energy efficiency, lifetime and lumen maintenance of the light bulb have been determined using the test procedures referred to in EN 50285. The report shall state the energy efficiency, lifetime and lumen maintenance of the light bulb. If the appropriate lifetime test has not been completed, the operational lifetime as stated on the packaging is acceptable pending the result of the test. However, the result of the test must be provided within 12 months of the date of application for the eco-label.\nThe applicant shall provide a test report stating that the mercury content has been measured using the method described below. The report shall state the average mercury content, calculated by analysing ten lamps, and then deleting the highest and lowest values before calculating the arithmetic mean of the remaining eight values.\nThe test method for the mercury content is as follows. The arc tube is first separated from its plastic surrounds and associated electronics. The associated leadwires are cut as close to the glass seal as possible. The arc tube is taken to a fume cupboard and is cut into segments. The segments are placed in a suitably sized robust screw-capped plastic bottle to which is added a 1 inch diameter porcelain ball and 25 ml of high purity concentrated nitric acid (70 %). The bottle is sealed and shaken for a few minutes to reduce the arc tube to fine particle size, the stopper is periodically loosened to eliminate any possibility of pressure build-up. The contents of the bottle are allowed to react for 30 minutes during which time the contents are periodically agitated. The contents of the bottle are then filtered through an acid resistant filter paper and collected in a 100 ml graduated volumetric flask. Potassium dichromate is then added to the flask so that the final concentration is 1000 ppm with respect to chromium. The flask is then made up to volume with pure water. Matched standards are made up on a concentration range up to 200 ppm mercury. The solutions are analysed using flame atomic absorption at a wavelength of 253,7 nm with background correction on. From the results obtained and knowledge of the solution volume, the original mercury content of the light bulb can be computed. The competent body may agree adaptations to the details of this test method if they are necessary for technical reasons, and these shall be applied in a consistent manner.\n2. Switch on/off\nFor compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), the number of switch on/off cycles shall be greater than 20000.\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the number of switch on/off cycles for a CFL has been determined using a rapid cycle test (0,5 minute on, 4,5 minutes off) and the test procedures for lifetime referred to in EN 50285. The report shall state the number of switch on/off cycles achieved when 50 % of CFLs tested meet the requirements for lamp lifetime referred to in EN 50285.\n3. Colour rendering index\nThe colour rendering (Ra) index of the light bulb shall be greater than 80.\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the colour rendering index of the light bulb has been determined using the test procedure referred to in CIE-standard/publication 29/2. The report shall state the colour rendering index of the light bulb.\n4. Flame retardants\n(a) Plastic parts heavier than 5 g shall not contain the following flame retardants:\n>TABLE>\n(b) Plastic parts heavier than 5 g shall not contain flame retardant substances or preparations containing substances that are assigned at the time of application any of the following risk phrases (or combinations thereof):\nR45 (may cause cancer)\nR46 (may cause heritable genetic damage)\nR50 (very toxic to aquatic organisms)\nR51 (toxic to aquatic organisms)\nR52 (harmful to aquatic organisms)\nR53 (may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment)\nR60 (may impair fertility)\nR61 (may cause harm to the unborn child)\nas defined in Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(2) and its subsequent amendments.\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n5. Packaging\nLaminates and composite plastics must not be used.\nFor single-ended light bulbs, all cardboard packaging must contain a minimum of 65 % recycled material (by weight).\nFor double-ended light bulbs, all cardboard packaging must contain a minimum of 80 % recycled material (by weight).\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n6. User instructions\nThe product shall be sold with relevant user information providing advice on its proper environmental use. In particular:\n(a) Information (pictogram or otherwise) on the packaging shall draw attention to the appropriate disposal conditions, including regulatory requirements.\n(b) For single-ended light bulbs: light bulbs which do not operate on dimmer switches shall be labelled, and the relative size and shape of the light bulb compared to a conventional incandescent lamp shall be indicated on the packaging.\n(c) For double-ended light bulbs: information on the packaging shall indicate that the environmental performance of the light bulb is improved when it is used with high frequency electronic control equipment.\n(d) The product packaging shall indicate that more information on the eco-label can be found at the web-site address: http://europa.eu.int/ecolabel.\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements, and shall provide a copy of the packaging to the competent body assessing the application.\n7.
