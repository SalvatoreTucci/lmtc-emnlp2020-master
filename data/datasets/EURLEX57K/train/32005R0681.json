However, in the framework for coupled payments established by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, this eligibility condition is not justified because the amount per hectare for coupled payments for flax and for other arable crops is the same. In the decoupled system there is no provision which refers to the variety list for flax. With a view to simplification, it is therefore appropriate to repeal this condition.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Since Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 applies to aid applications relating to marketing years starting from 1 January 2005, this Regulation should apply from that date.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 56(1)(b), point (i) is deleted;\n2.
