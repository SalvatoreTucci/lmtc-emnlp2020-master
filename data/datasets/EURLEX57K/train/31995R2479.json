The cables connecting the recording equipment to the transmitter must be protected by a  continuous plastic-coated rust-protected steel sheath with crimped ends except where an equivalent  protection against manipulation is guaranteed by other means (for example by electronic monitoring  such as signal encryption) capable of detecting the presence of any device, which is unnecessary  for the correct operation of the recording equipment and whose purpose is to prevent the accurate  operation of the recording equipment by short circuiting or interruption or by modification of the  electronic data from the speed and distance sensor. A joint, comprised of sealed connections, is  deemed to be continuous within the meaning of this Regulation.\nThe aforementioned electronic monitoring may be replaced by an electronic control which ensures  that the recording equipment is able to record any movement of the vehicle, independent from the  signal of the speed and distance sensor.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply as from 1 January 1996.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 October 1995.\nFor the Commission Neil KINNOCK Member of the Commission"}
