By letters of 18 February 2010 and 1\u00a0March 2010, Cyprus has informed the Commission about specific size of agricultural holdings and the structure of aid applications in respect of transitional fruit and vegetable payments granted for citrus fruits. As a result, the minimum area for which this payment shall be granted needs to be decreased to 0,1 hectares.\n(2) Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 lays down the rules fixing the agricultural area of the new Member States under the single area payment scheme provided for in Article 122 of that Regulation.\n(3) In accordance with Article 89 of Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009, the agricultural areas for Poland and Slovakia are set out in Annex VIII to that Regulation.\n(4) By letter of 1 December 2009, Poland has informed the Commission that it had reviewed its utilised agricultural area eligible for the single area payment scheme, as referred to in Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. The revision follows the updating of the identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, which has shown that the part of the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 was less than previously estimated. The agricultural area for the single area payment scheme should therefore be reduced to 14\u00a0137\u00a0000\u00a0ha.\n(5) By letter of 4 January 2010, Slovakia has informed the Commission that it had reviewed its utilised agricultural area eligible for the single area payment scheme, as referred to in Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. The revision is a consequence of the experience gained in recent years from the verification of the eligibility conditions for the single area payment under the single area payment scheme, which has shown that the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 is less than previously estimated. The agricultural area for the single area payment scheme should therefore be reduced to 1\u00a0865\u00a0000\u00a0ha.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The amendment proposed by this Regulation should apply to premium periods starting from 1 January 2010.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 5(1), the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n2.
