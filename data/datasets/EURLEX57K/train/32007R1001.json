The procedures concerning such proof should be simplified whilst safeguarding the financial interests of the Community. The Commission and the Member States should monitor the use of simplified procedures and take appropriate action in the case of abuse.\n(2) In practice, the third countries for which export refunds for a given product are differentiated to lower than average or zero values are generally situated close to the Community whilst refund levels tend to be set at a higher, identical level for countries which are more remote from the Community. In many cases, exporters have problems obtaining proof of importation into these more remote countries.\n(3) The countries for which the higher, identical levels of refund have been set may be considered as a \u2018remote refund zone\u2019 for the product concerned. However, remote countries for which the differentiated part of the refund is lower than average or zero should be excluded from such zone. Also those countries in respect of which a real risk of trade deflection exists, or all countries for sectors in respect of which a real risk of trade deflection exists should be excluded from such zone.\n(4) Where an export declaration is made for a country in a remote refund zone and export is made by container sea transport, the combination of commercial container management, transport documentation and the relatively inflexible transport modality gives a reasonable level of assurance that the products have been imported into the specific third country. Under these circumstances, proof that the products have been transported to and unloaded in a country in the remote refund zone could be provided by the combination of a transport document to the port in the country of destination or the port serving the hinterland of destination, and a declaration of unloading.\n(5) If a container carrier\u2019s commercial, computerised tracking and tracing system meets the operational security norms as set out in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD\u00a0(4), and provides information equivalent to that contained in transport documents, Member States may decide to use such information instead of the paper documents, as proof of transport to the country of destination.\n(6) Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides for derogations limited to EUR 2\u00a0400 and 12\u00a0000 on differentiated parts of the refund for contiguous or remote destinations. It is considered useful to provide for a new derogation for containerised sea transport to remote refund zones by requiring the transport document and one of the declarations of unloading referred to in point (a), (b) or (c) of Article 16(2). Such derogation may be granted only if information is provided on the unloading in the port situated in the remote refund zone. In order to ensure the reliability of the proof generated under such derogations, they should be granted under revocable authorisations.\n(7) In order to reduce the risk of substitution, all means of transport or packages should be sealed save in exceptional cases where the products may be identified by some other means in accordance with Article 340a and Article 357 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5). This requirement has been laid down in Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002 of 26 November 2002 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 as regards physical checks carried out when agricultural products qualifying for refunds are exported\u00a0(6). As that requirement is part of the formalities concerning the export declaration and of general character, it should be deleted from Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002 and a similar provision should be included in Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.\n(8) The customs office of exit needs information in the T5 control copy as to whether products presented to it qualify for a substitution check required in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002. As T5 control copies may also be used for products not qualifying for substitution checks, box 107 of the T5 control copy should bear information in case products are exported with a right to refunds.\n(9) Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 2090/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The provisions of this Regulation related to proof of arrival at destination should apply in respect of refund applications submitted from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. Since this Regulation is intended to simplify the administration of the scheme for operators and Member States alike, it should also be possible, at the request of the exporter, to apply it in respect of refund applications submitted before that date, provided that the time limit for submission of proof has not expired.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant Management Committees,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2(1), the following point is added:\n\u2018(p) \u201cremote refund zone\u201d means all destinations for which the same differentiated, non-zero part of the refund applies for a particular product except the excluded destinations for that product as set out in Annex XI;\n(q) \u201chinterland country\u201d means a third country without its own sea port which is served by the sea port of another third country.\u2019\n2. in Article 5, the following paragraph is added:\n3. in Article 8, the following paragraph is added:\n4. in Article 15, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(a) be imported in their unaltered state into the third country or one of the third countries for which the refund applies, or\n(b) be unloaded in their unaltered state in a remote refund zone for which the refund applies pursuant to the conditions set out in Article 17(1)(b) and (2).\n5.
