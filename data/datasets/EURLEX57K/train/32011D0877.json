Developments in the best available and economically justifiable technology which took place during the period 2006-2011 which was covered by the review, indicate that for the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity, the distinction drawn in Decision 2007/74/EC relating to the year of construction of a cogeneration unit should not be maintained for plants that were constructed from 1 January 2006 onwards. However for cogeneration units built in 2005 or before the reference values should continue to be applied reflecting the year of construction, in order to take into account the observed developments in the best available and economically justifiable technology. Furthermore, on the basis of recent experience and analysis, the review confirmed that correction factors relating to the climatic situation should continue to be applied. In addition, the correction factors for avoided grid losses should also continue to be applied as grid losses have not changed in recent years. Additionally, the correction factors for avoided grid losses should also apply to plants that use wood fuels and biogas.\n(4) The review has not produced evidence to indicate that the energy efficiency of boilers has changed in the period considered, and therefore the harmonised efficiency reference values for the separate production of heat should not relate to the year of construction. No correction factors relating to the climatic situation were required because the thermodynamics of generating heat from fuel do not depend significantly on the ambient temperature. In addition correction factors for heat grid losses are not required as heat is always used near the site of production.\n(5) Stable conditions for investment in cogeneration and continued investor confidence are needed. From this perspective, it is also appropriate to extend the current harmonised reference values for electricity and heat to the period 2012-2015.\n(6) Data from operational use under realistic conditions do not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of the actual performance of state-of-the-art plants in the period under review. Therefore the reference values established for the period 2006-2011 in Decision 2007/74/EC should be maintained for the period 2012-2015.\n(7) The review confirmed the validity of the existing correction factors relating to the climatic situation and to avoided grid losses.\n(8) The use of a single set of reference values for the entire period and the waiving of correction factors for climatic differences and grid losses were also confirmed for heat generation.\n(9) Taking into consideration that the main aim of Directive 2004/8/EC is to promote cogeneration in order to save energy, an incentive for retrofitting older cogeneration units should be given in order to improve their energy efficiency. For these reasons the efficiency reference values for electricity applicable to a cogeneration unit should become higher from the 11th year after the year of its construction.\n(10) This approach is consistent with the requirement for the harmonised efficiency reference values to be based on the principles mentioned in Annex III, point (f) of Directive 2004/8/EC.\n(11) Revised harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat should be established. Decision 2007/74/EC should, therefore, be repealed.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Cogeneration Committee,", "main_body": ["Establishment of the harmonised efficiency reference values\nThe harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat shall be as set out in Annex I and Annex II respectively.", "Application of the harmonised efficiency reference values\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall apply the harmonised efficiency reference values set out in Annex I relating to the year of construction of a cogeneration unit.

III\nCorrection factors relating to the average climatic situation and method for establishing climate zones for the application of the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity (referred to in Article 3(1))\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Correction factors relating to the average climatic situation\nAmbient temperature correction is based on the difference between the annual average temperature in a Member State and standard ISO conditions (15\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe correction will be as follows:\n(i) 0,1\u00a0%-point efficiency loss for every degree above 15\u00a0\u00b0C\n(ii) 0,1\u00a0%-point efficiency gain for every degree under 15\u00a0\u00b0C\nExample:\nWhen the average annual temperature in a Member State is 10\u00a0\u00b0C, the reference value of a cogeneration unit in that Member State has to be increased with 0,5\u00a0%-points.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method for establishing climate zones\nThe borders of each climate zone will be constituted by isotherms (in full degrees Celsius) of the annual average ambient temperature which differ at least 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature difference between the average annual ambient temperatures applied in adjacent climate zones will be at least 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nExample:\nIn a Member State the average annual ambient temperature in place A is 12\u00a0\u00b0C and in place B it is 6\u00a0\u00b0C. The difference is more than 5\u00a0\u00b0C. The Member State has now the option to introduce two climate zones separated by the isotherm of 9\u00a0\u00b0C, thus constituting one climate zone between the isotherms of 9\u00a0\u00b0C and 13\u00a0\u00b0C with an average annual ambient temperature of 11\u00a0\u00b0C and another climate zone between the isotherms of 5\u00a0\u00b0C and 9\u00a0\u00b0C with an average annual ambient temperature of 7\u00a0\u00b0C.\nANNEX IV\nCorrection factors for avoided grid losses for the application of the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity (referred to in Article 3(2))\nVoltage For electricity exported to the grid For electricity consumed on-site\n>\u00a0200\u00a0kV 1 0,985\n100-200\u00a0kV 0,985 0,965\n50-100\u00a0kV 0,965 0,945\n0,4-50\u00a0kV 0,945 0,925\n<\u00a00,4\u00a0kV 0,925 0,860\nExample:\nA 100\u00a0kWel cogeneration unit with a reciprocating engine driven with natural gas generates electricity of 380\u00a0V. Of this electricity 85\u00a0% is used for own consumption and 15\u00a0% is fed into the grid. The plant was constructed in 1999. The annual ambient temperature is 15\u00a0\u00b0C (so no climatic correction is necessary).\nIn accordance with Article 2 of this Decision for cogeneration units older than 10 years of age the reference values of units of 10 years of age should be applied. According to Annex I to this Decision for a natural gas cogeneration unit built in 1999, which has not been retrofitted, the harmonised efficiency reference value applicable in 2011 is the reference value for 2001, 51,7\u00a0%. After the grid loss correction the resulting efficiency reference value for the separate production of electricity in this cogeneration unit would be (based on the weighted mean of the factors in this Annex):\nRef \u0395\u03b7 = 51,7\u00a0%\u00a0*\u00a0(0,860\u00a0*\u00a085\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a00,925\u00a0*\u00a015\u00a0%)\u00a0=\u00a045,0\u00a0%"}
