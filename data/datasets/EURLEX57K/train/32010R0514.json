The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 16244) as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019.\n(4) It results from the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 3 February 2010\u00a0(2) that Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 16244) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that this preparation has the potential to improve the production of silage. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory established by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 16244) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this additive should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 June 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8(2):1502.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of organic material\nCategory of technological additives.
