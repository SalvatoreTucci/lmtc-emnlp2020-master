The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by the United Kingdom in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2009, the average ageing period for Scotch whisky in 2009 was 7 years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Union has concluded agreements abolishing export refunds with certain third countries. Under the terms of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1670/2006, this should be taken into account in calculating the coefficients for 2010/2011.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1035/2009 of 30 October 2009 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Scotch whisky for the period 2009/2010\u00a0(3) has exhausted its effects, as it concerns the coefficients applicable for the year 2009/2010.
