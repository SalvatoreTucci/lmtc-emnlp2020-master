whereas colchicine should therefore be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II, III and IV of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 1996.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 151, 26. 6. 1996, p. 26.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nA.
