Since CEN has replaced those standards by new ones due to technical progress, it is appropriate to update the references to those standards in Annexes I and II to Directive 98/70/EC.\n(3) Annex III to Directive 98/70/EC specifies the permitted vapour pressure waiver for petrol containing bioethanol. The figures contained in that Annex are rounded to the second decimal place. Standard EN ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 4259:2006 defines the rules for rounding results according to the precision of the test method and requires rounding to the first decimal place. It is therefore appropriate to amend the figures set out in Annex III to Directive 98/70/EC accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Fuel Quality, established by Article 11(1) of Directive 98/70/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 98/70/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) footnote 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(1) Test methods shall be those specified in EN 228:2008. Member States may adopt the analytical method specified in replacement EN 228:2008 standard if it can be shown to give at least the same accuracy and at least the same level of precision as the analytical method it replaces.\u2019;\n(b) footnote 6 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(6) Other mono-alcohols and ethers with a final boiling point no higher than that stated in EN 228:2008.\u2019;\n(2) in Annex II, footnote 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(1) Test methods shall be those specified in EN 590:2009.
