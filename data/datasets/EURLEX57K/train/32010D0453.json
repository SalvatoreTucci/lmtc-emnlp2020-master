The inspector should gather detailed information to be provided to the competent authority in line with the specific mandate of the inspection.\nAn inspection is a sampling exercise as inspectors cannot examine all areas and documentation during an inspection. An inspector should not be held responsible for deficiencies that could not be observed during the inspection due to limited time or scope or because certain processes could not be observed taking place during the inspection.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qualifications of inspectors\nInspectors should at least:\n(a) possess a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications in the field of medical or biological sciences, awarded on completion of a university course of study or a course recognised as equivalent by the Member State concerned;\n(b) have practical experience in the relevant areas of operations within a tissue, cell or blood establishment. Other prior experiences may also be considered as relevant.\nThe competent authorities may consider in exceptional cases that a person\u2019s considerable and relevant experience may exempt him/her from the requirement set out in point (a).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Training of inspectors\nWhen taking up their duties, inspectors should receive a specific induction training. This training should at least include:\n(a) the accreditation, designation, authorisation or licensing systems in the Member State concerned;\n(b) the applicable legal framework for the performance of their activities;\n(c) the technical aspects of tissues and cells establishments activities;\n(d) the inspection techniques and procedures, including practical exercises;\n(e) International Quality Management Systems (ISO, EN);\n(f) National Health systems and tissue and cells organizational structures in the Member State concerned;\n(g) organisation of national regulatory authorities;\n(h) International Inspection instruments and other relevant bodies.\nThis induction training should be complemented by specialised training and by continuous in-house training as appropriate throughout the career of the inspector.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Types of inspections\n5.1. Different types of inspection may be carried out:\n5.2.

The interval between two inspections shall not exceed two years.\nIt is recommended that a full on-site inspection covering all areas of activity should be performed at least every four years. During the interval between two general system inspections, a thematic inspection may be performed which focuses on a particular theme or process, or alternatively, in the absence of significant changes since the last inspection, a desk-based review may be performed.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conduct of inspections\n7.1. Where resources allow, the team should be composed of members with different competences.\n7.2. An inspection report should be sent after the inspection to the tissue establishment or third party inspected. The conclusions of the report should clearly identify the deficiencies observed.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspectorate quality management system\nEach competent authority should have a quality management system in place comprising adequate standard operating procedures and an appropriate internal audit system. The competent authorities should regularly perform an evaluation of their inspection systems."}
