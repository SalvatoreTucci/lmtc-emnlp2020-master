These preferences took the form of a gradual reduction of Common Customs Tariff duties and, from 1978 to 31 December 1994, the complete suspension of these duties.\n(2) Since the entry into force of the GSP-scheme in 1995, the Community has, alongside the GATT, opened autonomous zero-duty Community tariff quotas for specific quantities of jute and coconut-fibre products. The tariff quotas opened for those products by Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 have been extended until 31\u00a0December 2005 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 25/2005\u00a0(2).\n(3) As the GSP-scheme has been extended until 31\u00a0December 2008 by Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying generalised tariff preferences\u00a0(3), the tariff quota arrangement for jute and coconut-fibre products should also be extended until 31\u00a0December 2008.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["The phrase, for serial numbers 09.0107, 09.0109 and 09.0111, in the fifth column (Quota period) of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 32/2000, \u2018from 1.1.2005 to 31.12.2005\u2019 is replaced by \u2018from 1.1.2006 to 31.12.2006, from 1.1.2007 to 31.12.2007 and from 1.1.2008 to 31.12.2008\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 8.1.2000, p. 1.
