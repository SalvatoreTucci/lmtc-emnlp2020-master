The text of Article 8 (1), (2) and (3) of Protocol 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n\"1. Originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, on importation into the Community or into Switzerland, benefit from the Agreement upon submission of one of the following documents:    (a) an EUR 1 movement certificate, hereinafter referred to as \"an EUR 1 certificate\", a specimen of which is given in Annex V to this Protocol, or\n(b) a form EUR 2, a specimen of which is given in Annex VI to this Protocol, for consignments consisting only of originating products, and provided the value does not exceed 2 400 European units of account per consignment.\n2. The following originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, on importation into the Community or into Switzerland, benefit from the Agreement without it being necessary to produce either of the documents referred to in paragraph 1:    (a) products sent as small packages to private persons, provided that the value of the products does not exceed 165 European units of account;\n(b) products forming part of travellers' personal luggage, provided that the value does not exceed 480 European units of account.\nThese provisions shall be applied only when such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of the Agreement, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration.\nImportations which are occasional and consist solely of goods for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as importations by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the goods that no commercial purpose is in view.\n3. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting State equivalent to the amounts expressed in European units of account shall be fixed by the exporting State and communicated to the other parties to the Agreement. When the amounts are more than the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing State, the importing State shall accept them if the goods are invoiced in the currency of the exporting State.\nIf the goods are invoiced in the currency of another Member State of the Community or another country  mentioned in Article 2 of this Protocol, the importing State shall recognize the amount notified by the country concerned.\n4. Up to and including 30 April 1981, the European unit of account to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the European unit of account as at 30 June 1978. For each successive period of two years, it shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the European unit of account as at the first working day in October in the year immediately preceding that two-year period.\"\n2. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 8 of Protocol 3 shall become paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively.\n3. In Article 13 (2) of Protocol 3 the reference to \"Article 8 (4)\" shall be replaced by a reference to \"Article 8 (5)\".\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on 1 January 1979.\nDone at Brussels, 5 December 1978.\nFor the Joint Committee\nThe Chairman\nP.
