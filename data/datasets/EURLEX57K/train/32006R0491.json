In order to improve monitoring of imports under that tariff quota, it is necessary to allocate a serial number to each subquota. It should also be recalled that import licence applications are to be submitted in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(3) and that the applicant must therefore lodge a security on the day when the licence application is submitted.\n(2) In order to ensure that the actual quantities being requested by individual traders may be verified, it is necessary to specify that traders must submit only one import licence application per serial number and per weekly period concerned, and to provide for a penalty in the event of a failure to meet this requirement.\n(3) With a view to modernising the management of the system, provision should be made for the information required by the Commission to be transmitted electronically.\n(4) In order to permit improved monitoring of imports under the subquota for third countries other than the United States and Canada, import licence applications and import licences themselves should mention only one country of origin.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
