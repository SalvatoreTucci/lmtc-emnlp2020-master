The Member State may take more stringent action in the field covered by this Directive if deemed necessary and proportionate to contain the disease, taking into account the particular epidemiological, animal husbandry, commercial and social conditions prevailing.\n(6) Furthermore, all movements of live poultry and hatching eggs within the Netherlands and their dispatch to other Member States was prohibited.\n(7) The same prohibitions should apply to exports to third countries in order to protect their health status and to prevent the risk of re-entry of such consignments in another Member State.\n(8) For the sake of clarity and transparency the Commission has taken Decision 2003/153/EC(5) of 3 March 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to strong suspicion of avian influenza in the Netherlands, as amended by Decision 2003/156/EC(6), after consultation with the Dutch authorities, thereby reinforcing the measures taken by the Netherlands and granting certain specific derogations for movements of slaughter poultry and day-old chicks within the Netherlands.\n(9) By Commission Decisions 2003/156/EC, 2003/172/EC(7), 2003/186/EC(8) and 2003/191/EC(9) the measures provided for in Decision 2003/153/EC were prolonged in view of the evolution of the disease and amended as necessary.\n(10) The currently available epidemiological information and the first results of the surveillance programme, carried out nation-wide in the Netherlands, suggest that the occurrence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus appears to be restricted in the \"Gelderse Vallei\".\n(11) In the light of the evolution of the disease, it is appropriate to further prolong the measures adopted under Decision 2003/191/EC. However, a derogation should also be provided for the dispatch of day-old chicks from the Netherlands to other Member States under certain conditions, unless they are originating from hatcheries or holdings within the established surveillance zones. For this purpose, additional certification requirements should be provided for.\n(12) Furthermore, movements of rearing turkeys within the Netherlands but outside the restricted zones, and movements of hatching eggs within the restricted zones, should be authorised under official control.\n(13) Fresh poultrymeat destined for intra-Community trade has to be marked with a health mark in accordance with the health mark foreseen in Chapter XII of Annex I of Directive 71/118/EEC(10), as last amended by Council Directive 97/79/EC(11). In order to allow the marketing on the Dutch market of fresh poultrymeat obtained from poultry originating from the established surveillance zones special provisions for its health marking shall be laid down.\n(14) Having evaluated the situation in close cooperation with the Dutch authorities in order to protect the Community poultry population and to avoid the spread of the infection outside the protection zone it is appropriate to preventively empty the poultry holdings situated in two areas particularly at risk.\n(15) The other Member States have already adjusted the measures they apply to trade, and they are sufficiently informed by the Commission, and in particular in the context of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on the appropriate period for their implementation.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1. Without prejudice to the measures taken by the Netherlands within the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC applied to the surveillance zones, the Dutch veterinary authorities shall ensure that no live poultry and hatching eggs are dispatched from the Netherlands to other Member States and to third countries.\n2. By derogation from paragraph 1 the Netherlands may dispatch day old chicks, which have been hatched in a hatchery situated outside the surveillance zones and at least 25 km away from any suspected or infected hatchery or holding. The hatching eggs must originate from a holding which at the day of collection of the eggs and on the day of the hatch is situated outside the established surveillance zones and at least 25 km away from any suspected or infected hatchery or holding. The flocks from which the day-old chicks derive of must have been subjected to a serological survey with negative results. The hatching eggs must be hatched in incubators or hatchers separately from hatching eggs not complying with this paragraph.\nThe animal health certificates accompanying consignments of day-old chicks from the Netherlands as specified above to other Member States shall include the words:\n\"The animal heath conditions of this consignment are in accordance with Decision 2003/214/EC.\"\nThe competent authority shall only allow the dispatch of day-old chicks as provided for under this paragraph following 48 hours advance notification to the central and local veterinary authorities of destination and shall dispatch the notification.\n3.
