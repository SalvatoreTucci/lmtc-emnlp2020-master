OBJECTIVES\nTo coordinate and promote infrastructure projects of Community interest,  in order to create a modern and efficient transport network in the Community, designed to meet  genuine transport needs arising at the European level on the main Community links.

CRITERIA\nThe assessment of transport infrastructure programmes for Community support under  the medium-term programme, without prejudice as to the precise form that this should take, shall be  based on the following criteria:\n(a)  the benefit of the project to the Community, assessed by its contribution to the general and  operational criteria set out in section I. Among the factors which must be included are:\n- the importance of present or potential intra-Community international traffic,\n- the importance of exchanges between the Community and non-member States on the route involved in  the project,\n- the extent of the project's contribution to the creation of an homogenous and balanced network  within the Community framework, geared to existing and future transport needs;\n(b)  the socio-economic return on the project;\n(c)  whether the project is consistent with other Community measures under the common transport  policy or other Community policies, and with other national measures given priority in national  transport infrastructure plans and projects."}
