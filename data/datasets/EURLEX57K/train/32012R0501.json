The taste is dense and mild, fine and fresh, sour but not astringent, delicious and slightly sweet. Depending on specifications, the total acidity (based on acetic acid) falls within the range 5,00\u00a0g-6,00\u00a0g per 100\u00a0ml (not more than 15,50\u00a0g), fixed acid (based on lactic acid) 1,20\u00a0g-1,60\u00a0g per 100\u00a0ml, amino acid nitrogen (based on nitrogen) 0,12\u00a0g-0,18\u00a0g per 100\u00a0ml, and reducing sugar (based on dextrose) above 2,20\u00a0g per 100\u00a0ml.\nDepending on length of storage, Zhenjiang Xiang Cu is divided into two categories, viz. \u2018Fragrant Vinegar\u2019, which is the regular form with a storage period of over 180 days, and \u2018Mature Vinegar\u2019, which refers to Zhenjiang Fragrant Vinegar with a storage period of over 365 days.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sticky rice: from the region of Zhenjiang.

It lies between 31\u00b037\u2032-32\u00b019\u2032 north latitude and 118\u00b058\u2032-119\u00b058\u2032 east longitude. The region comprises Jurong City, Danyang City, Yangzhong City, Dantu District, Jingkou District, Runzhou District and Zhenjiang Development Zone.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nZhenjiang is located in the southeast of China, at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal. It has a typical humid monsoon climate with a transition from a warm temperate zone to a subtropical zone. The annual average sunshine duration is 2\u00a0050,7 hours, the rate of sunshine is 46,8\u00a0%, the annual average temperature is 15,4\u00a0\u00b0C, the average humidity 77\u00a0% and the annual average precipitation is above 1\u00a0000\u00a0mm. The region of Zhenjiang is made up of sprawling low hills, fertile farmland, an intricate river network, and large numbers of small islands and ports along the river; the area is green in a pleasant, bright and humid climate.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe colour of Zhenjiang Xiang Cu is a strong lustrous reddish brown with umber. The vinegar has a strong fragrance of fried rice and brewery products. The taste is dense and mild taste, albeit with a sour touch which includes acetic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and gluconic acid, but which is not particularly astringent. It is fine and fresh, delicious and slightly sweet.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product\nZhenjiang is located in the southeast of China and has a typical humid monsoon climate with a transition from a warm temperate zone to a subtropical zone. It lies at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal, in a country side of low green hills, fertile farmland, an intricate river network, and large numbers of small islands and ports along the river. It abounds in such agricultural crops as rice, wheat, barley and green peas, with rich by-products such as wheat bran and rice husk. The fact that Zhenjiang is humid and green can be conducive to the yield and reproduction of acetic acid bacteria. Water from the hills and springs gathers in rivers, lakes and wetlands after flowing through stone and rock, resulting in a rich content of mineral materials and producing a strong and slightly sweet flavour, which is most suitable for brewing vinegar.\nZhenjiang City has long been known as the \u2018City in the mountain forest and Home of Vinegar\u2019. People in Zhenjiang started to make vinegar 1\u00a0400 years ago. The use of Zhenjiang Xiang Cu became established in the Liang Dynasty; it was regarded as the best rice vinegar in the early China Medicine Classics and won an international gold award in the Qing Dynasty. Zhenjiang Xiang Cu has become the city\u2019s visiting card. There are almost 100 manufacturing plants producing vinegar in the city, where the fragrance of vinegar is in the air and vinegar-related eating habits and food culture can be seen everywhere.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)"}
