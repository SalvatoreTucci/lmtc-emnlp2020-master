Directive 2000/25/EC provided that the emission limits applicable in 2010 for type-approval of the majority of compression ignition engines, referred to as Stage III A, were to be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits, entering into force progressively as from 1 January 2010 as regards the type-approval, and from 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market, for those engines. Stage IV, providing for emission limits more stringent than Stage III B, will enter into force progressively as from 1 January 2013 as regards the type-approval for those engines and from 1 January 2014 with regard to the placing on the market.\n(2) Article 2(b) of Directive 2004/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery\u00a0(4), provides that the Commission is to consider the available technology, including the cost/benefits, with a view to confirming Stage III B and IV limit values and evaluating the possible need for additional flexibilities, exemptions or later introduction dates for certain types of equipment or engines and taking into account engines installed in non-road mobile machinery used in seasonal applications. Moreover, Article 4(8) of Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a review clause in order to take into account the specificities of tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C2.\n(3) Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) was the subject of several technical studies. As a result of those technical studies carried out in 2007, 2009 and 2010 and confirmed by the impact assessment carried out by the Commission, it was established that it is not technically feasible for tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C2 to meet the requirements of Stages III B and IV by the dates set out in that Directive.\n(4) In order to prevent Union legislation from prescribing technical requirements which cannot be met yet and in order to prevent a situation in which tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C2 can no longer be type-approved and placed on the market or put into service, it is necessary to provide for a transitional period of 3 years, during which tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C2 may still be type-approved and placed on the market or put into service.\n(5) The Commission should report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on progress in the development of technical solutions for Stage IV-compliant technology.\n(6) Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 2000/25/EC\nIn Article 4 of Directive 2000/25/EC, the following paragraph is added:\n\u20189.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation, the dates set out in points (d) and (e) of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 3 shall, for tractors of categories T2, T4.1 and C2, as defined respectively in the second indent of point A.1 of Chapter A, in point 1.1 of Part I of Appendix 1 of Chapter B, and in point A.2 of Chapter A of Annex II to Directive 2003/37/EC, and equipped with engines of categories L to R, be postponed for 3 years.
