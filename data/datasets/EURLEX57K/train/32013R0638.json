Neither the exporting producers nor the authorities in the PRC came forward and submitted a questionnaire reply. Questionnaires were also sent to sixteen importers in the Union. Only one importer came forward but did not submit a questionnaire reply.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION\n(7) By letters of 3 and 4 April 2013 to the Commission, the four Union producers formally withdrew their request to investigate the possible circumvention of the existing measures.\n(8) Under Article 9(1) and Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, the investigation may be terminated where the request is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission considered that the present investigation should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China by imports of certain aluminium foil in rolls which are not annealed and of a width exceeding 650\u00a0mm originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China should be terminated.\n(11) The registration of imports of the product under investigation introduced by Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 should therefore be discontinued and Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 be repealed,", "main_body": ["The investigation initiated by Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 925/2009 on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China by imports of aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,008\u00a0mm and not more than 0,018\u00a0mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in rolls which are not annealed, of a width exceeding 650\u00a0mm and of a weight exceeding 10\u00a0kg and currently falling within CN code ex\u00a07607\u00a011\u00a019 (TARIC code 7607111920), originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, is hereby terminated.", "Customs authorities shall discontinue the registration of imports established in accordance to Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 973/2012.", "Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 262, 6.10.2009, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 293, 23.10.2012, p. 28."}
