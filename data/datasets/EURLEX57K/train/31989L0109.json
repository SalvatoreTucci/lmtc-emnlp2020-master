Where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing  information made since one of the specific directives was adopted, has detailed grounds for  establishing that the use of a material or article endangers human health although it complies with  the relevant specific directive, that Member State may temporarily suspend or restrict application  of the provisions in question within its territory. It shall immediately inform the other Member  States and the Commission thereof and give reasons for its decision\n2. The Commission shall examine  as soon as possible within the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs the grounds adduced by the Member  State referred to in Paragraph 1 and shall deliver its opinion without delay and take the  appropriate measures.\n3. If the Commission considers that amendments to the specific directives in question are necessary  in order to remedy the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 1 and to ensure the protection of human  health, it shall initiate the procedure laid down in Article 9 with a view to adopting those  amendments; the Member State which has adopted safeguard measures may in that event retain them  until the amendments have been adopted.", "1.

Where  appropriate, Positive lists of substances shall be established for materials and articles intended  to come into contact with foodstuffs. The acceptability of a substance for inclusion in a positive  list shall be determined by considering both the quantity of the substance which is liable to  migrate into foodstuffs and the toxicity of the substance\n2. A substance shall only be included in  a positive list where, under normal or foreseeable conditions of use of any material or article of  which it forms a part, the substance is not liable to migrate into foodstuffs in a quantity likely  to constitute a danger to human health\n3. For certain materials it may be inappropriate to  establish a positive list because such a list would offer no tangible benefit in terms of  safeguarding human health. In such circumstances, any substances for which specific migration  limits need to be established in order to prevent their being transferred to foodstuffs in  quantities likely to constitute a danger to health shall be identified. The criteria set out in  paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to these substances\n4. All substances shall be kept under  review and reassessed whenever this is justified by fresh scientific data or a re-evaluation of  existing scientific data\n5. Where an acceptable daily intake or a tolerable daily intake is  established foraparticular substance, the need to establish a specific migration limit in order  that this intake is not exceeded shall be considered. Where such a specific migration limit is  established for a substance, due regard shall be paid to other possible sources of exposure to the  substance\n6. In certain circumstances, a specific migration limit on a substance may not be the  most valid means of safeguarding human health. In such circumstances, the need to protect human  health shall be the primary consideration in determining what action might be appropriate.\nANNEX III\nCORRELATION TABLF\n>TABLE>"}
