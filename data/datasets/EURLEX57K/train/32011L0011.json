That list includes (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 19, repellents and attractants, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.\n(3) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 23 February 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 24 September 2010, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as attractants and containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate in Annex I to that Directive.\n(6) It also appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as attractants and containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate may be expected to present only low risk to humans, animals and the environment and to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC, in particular with regard to the use which was examined and detailed in the assessment report, i.e. in traps for indoor use containing a maximum of 2\u00a0mg of the active substance. It is therefore appropriate to include (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate in Annex IA to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States, when granting product authorisations, assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to the environmental compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(8) In the light of the assumptions made during the evaluation, it is appropriate to require that (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate is not applied where food or feed is stored unless the food or feed packaging is closed or re-closed. Labels should therefore indicate that biocidal products containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate are not to be used in spaces where un-packaged food or feed is kept.\n(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and IA to Directive 98/8/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 January 2012 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 February 2013.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.
