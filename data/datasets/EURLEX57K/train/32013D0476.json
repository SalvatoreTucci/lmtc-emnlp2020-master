Ratu Epeli NAILATIKAU\nPresident of the Republic of Fiji\nSuva\nRepublic of Fiji\nYour Excellency,\nThe European Union (EU) attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which form the essential elements of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, and are the basis of our relations.\nSix years have elapsed since the EU took a decision on the appropriate measures following the military coup of 2006, and since then a set of commitments were agreed with Fiji.\nThe EU notes that since 2007 some of the agreed commitments have become outdated and some are in need of revision in the light of Fiji's new legal framework. In order to have an appropriate basis for assessing Fiji's reform progress, we need to revise these commitments together, taking into account the current situation and the legal framework.\nThe EU has therefore decided to include in its new decision on appropriate measures a requirement that the EU engage with Fiji in an enhanced political dialogue under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. This will be with a view to revising together the agreed commitments of 2007, and to adapting the appropriate measures (annexed to this letter) accordingly, as necessary steps towards ensuring respect for human rights, the restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law, until both parties conclude that the enhanced nature of the dialogue has served its purpose.\nAs some restrictions on certain human rights and fundamental freedoms remain in Fiji, and in light of the necessary revision of the agreed commitments, the EU has decided to extend the appropriate measures by 18 months, until 31 March 2015. This will provide the necessary flexibility and will give both the EU and Fiji the time they need to agree on the commitments, to adapt the appropriate measures accordingly, and for the government to hold its elections planned for September 2014.\nThe EU will monitor the progress made towards a return to constitutional rule and this will continue to guide our upcoming decisions on development cooperation. In this spirit the EU confirms its willingness to engage in preparations for the 11th EDF programming process, and to notify in due course an indicative national financing allocation in this process. The finalisation, signature and implementation of 11th EDF programming documents will be envisaged with the democratically elected government.\nOnce Fiji has held free and fair elections and met the revised agreed commitments, an Article 96 review mission, in line with the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, will be conducted in Fiji. Based on an agreement on the recommendations of this assessment, the Article 96 appropriate measures can then be concluded for Fiji.\nIn order to advance cooperation under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and the Development Cooperation Instrument, the EU invites the Interim Government to engage in an enhanced political dialogue with the EU, starting as soon as possible.\nThe EU also welcomes the engagement with the Pacific Island's Forum Ministerial Contact Group set up to monitor the progress of Fiji's preparations for the elections and its return to democracy and looks forward to the next steps for a transparent, participatory and credible electoral process, leading to free and fair elections and Fiji's return to democratic rule.\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Council\nC. ASHTON\nPresident\nFor the Commission\nA. PIEBALGS\nCommissioner\nANNEX 1 TO THE ANNEX\nThe appropriate measures, which will be adapted following the revision of the agreed commitments under the enhanced political dialogue, are as follows:\n\u2014 humanitarian aid and direct support to civil society and vulnerable populations may continue;\n\u2014 the cooperation activities under way, in particular under the 8th and 9th EDFs, was allowed to continue;\n\u2014 cooperation activities that would help the return to democracy and improve governance may be pursued, save under very exceptional circumstances;\n\u2014 implementation of the sugar reform accompanying measures for 2006 was allowed to proceed. The Financing Agreement was signed at the technical level by Fiji on 19 June 2007. It is noted that the Financing Agreement includes a suspension clause;\n\u2014 the 2007 sugar allocation is zero;\n\u2014 availability of the 2008 sugar allocation was subject to evidence of credible and timely preparation of elections in accordance with the agreed commitments, notably regarding a census, the redrafting of boundaries and electoral reform in accordance with the Constitution, and measures taken to ensure the functioning of the Elections Office, including the appointment of a Supervisor of Elections by 30 September 2007 in accordance with the Constitution. This 2008 sugar allocation was lost on 31 December 2009;\n\u2014 the 2009 sugar allocation was cancelled in May 2009 because the Interim Government decided to delay general elections until September 2014;\n\u2014 the 2010 allocation was cancelled before 1 May 2010 as no progress was made in the continuation of the democratic process; however, given the critical situation of the sugar sector part of the allocation was set aside for direct assistance to the population directly dependent on sugar production in order to mitigate adverse social consequences. These funds are centrally managed by the EU's Delegation in Suva and not channelled through the Government;\n\u2014 the preparation of programming for the 11th EDF may be launched, so that Fiji could expect to be notified of an indicative allocation in due course;\n\u2014 specific support for the preparation and implementation of key commitments, in particular in support of the preparation and/or holding of elections, could be considered;\n\u2014 regional cooperation, and Fiji's participation in it, is unaffected;\n\u2014 monitoring of the commitments will be in accordance with the terms in the Annex to this letter concerning regular dialogue, and effective cooperation with assessment and monitoring missions and reporting.\nANNEX 2 TO THE ANNEX\nCOMMITMENTS AGREED WITH THE REPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS IN 2007\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respect for Democratic Principles\nCommitment No 1\nThat free and fair parliamentary elections take place within 24 months from 1 March 2007, subject to the findings of an assessment to be carried out by the independent auditors appointed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.
