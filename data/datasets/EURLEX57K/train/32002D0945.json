An analysis of those reports indicates that certain Member States will not utilise their full allocation for 2002, while others will carry out monitoring in excess of the number of tests funded. It is therefore appropriate to re-allocate funding from Member States which are not using their full allocation to those that are exceeding it.\n(4) Decisions 2001/730/EC and 2001/854/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2001/730/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "Decision 2001/854/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2), \"EUR 4887000\" is replaced by \"EUR 5362385\";\n2. in Article 2(2,) \"EUR 2892000\" is replaced by \"EUR 3240550\";\n3. in Article 3(2), \"EUR 21077000\" is replaced by \"EUR 23244735\";\n4. in Article 4(2), \"EUR 1851000\" is replaced by \"EUR 1209935\";\n5. in Article 5(2), \"EUR 11240000\" is replaced by \"EUR 8369625\";\n6. in Article 6(2), \"EUR 35361000\" is replaced by \"EUR 37458845\";\n7. in Article 7(2), \"EUR 11136000\" is replaced by \"EUR 11748995\";\n8. in Article 8(2), \"EUR 11379000\" is replaced by \"EUR 9756085\";\n9. in Article 9(2, \"EUR 350000\" is replaced by \"EUR 283080\";\n10. in Article 10(2), \"EUR 6104000\" is replaced by \"EUR 6829450\";\n11. in Article 11(2), \"EUR 3325000\" is replaced by \"EUR 3364830\";\n12. in Article 12(2), \"EUR 2874000\" is replaced by \"EUR 1473085\";\n13. in Article 13(2), \"EUR 1329000\" is replaced by \"EUR 1501455\";\n14. in Article 14(2), \"EUR 651000\" is replaced by \"EUR 612945\".", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.9.1990, p. 19.\n(2) OJ L 203, 28.7.2001, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 274, 17.10.2001, p. 20.\n(4) OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 65.\n(5) OJ L 318, 4.12.2001, p. 54.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Decision 2001/730/EC is replaced by the following:\n\"ANNEX\nList of TSE monitoring programmes\nRate and maximum amount of the Community's financial contribution\n>TABLE>\""}
