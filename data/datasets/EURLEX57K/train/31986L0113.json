'Laying hens' means adult hens of the species Gallus gallus which are kept for egg production.\n2. 'Battery cage' means any enclosed space intended for laying hens in a battery system.\n3.

Its length shall be at least 10 cm multiplied by the number of animals in the cage;\n(c) Unless nipple drinkers or drinking cups are provided, each battery cage shall have a continuous drinking channel of the same length as the feed trough mentioned in point (b). Where drinking points are plumbed in, at least two nipple drinkers or two drinking cups shall be within reach of each cage;\n(d) Battery cages shall be at least 40 cm high over 65 % of the cage area and not less than 35 cm at any point;\n(e) Floors of battery cages must be constructed so as to support adequately each of the forward facing claws of each foot. Floor slope shall not exceed 14 % or 8 degrees. In the case of floors using other than rectangular wire mesh, Member States may permit steeper slopes.\n2. Moreover, Member States shall ensure that from 1 January 1995 the minimum requirements laid down in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 1 apply to all battery cages.", "Member States shall ensure that conditions for laying hens kept in battery cages are in accordance with the general requirements laid down in the Annex.", "The provisions of the Annex may be amended in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 in order to take account of scientific developments.", "Member States shall arrange for inspections to be made by the competent authority to ensure that this Directive, including the Annex, is complied with.", "1.

The form and type of materials employed for constructing the cages and the construction and characteristics of the latter must be such as to prevent any injury to the animals to the extent possible in the existing state of technology.\n2. The design and size of the cage opening must be such that an adult hen can be removed without causing unnecessary suffering or injury.\n3. The cages must be suitably equipped to prevent the poultry escaping.\n4. All poultry shall have access to adequate, nutritious and hygienic feed each day and to adequate fresh water at all times, except in the case of therapeutic or prophylactic treatment.\n5. Insulation and ventilation of the building must ensure that air velocity, dust level, temperature, relative air humidity and gas concentrations are kept within limits that are not harmful to the poultry.\n6. In the case of artificial lighting, the poultry must have an appropriate resting period each day during which the light intensity must be reduced in such a way that the poultry can rest properly.\n7. It shall be ensured that the hens are cared for by a sufficient number of personnel with adequate knowledge and experience of laying hens and of the production system used.\n8. The flock or group of poultry shall be inspected at least once a day and for this purpose a source of light shall be available which is strong enough for each bird to be seen clearly and, if need be, thoroughly inspected.\n9. Accommodation comprising more than three tiers of cages shall be permitted only if suitable devices or measures make it possible to inspect all tiers without difficulty.\n10. For poultry appearing not to be in good health, including behavioural changes, steps shall be taken to establish the cause and appropriate remedial measures shall be implemented, e.g. treatment, isolation, culling or attention to environmental factors. If the cause is traced to an environmental factor in the production unit which it is not essential to remedy immediately, this should be corrected when the accommodation is emptied and before the next batch of poultry is put in.\n11. All automatic equipment essential for the animals' health and welfare must be inspected at least once daily. Where defects are discovered these must be rectified immediately or, if this is impracticable, appropriate steps taken to safeguard the health and welfare of the animals until the defect has been rectified. Alternative ways of feeding and of maintaining a satisfactory environment must be available for use in the event of a breakdown.\nThere must be an alarm system to warn the stock-keeper of failure of any essential automated ventilation equipment.\n12. Those parts of the cage which are in contact with the poultry shall be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected every time the cage is emptied and before a new batch of poultry is brought in. While the cage is occupied, the surfaces and all equipment shall be kept satisfactorily clean."}
