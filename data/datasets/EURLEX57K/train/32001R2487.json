Pending the completion of the procedure necessary for its entry into force an Interim Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia covering trade and trade-related provisions was concluded and entered into force on 1 June 2001.\n(2) The Council is in the process of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia of the other part, which was signed on 29 October 2001. Pending the completion of the procedure necessary for its entry into force an Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia covering trade and trade-related provisions was signed on 29 October 2001 and will be applied as of 1 January 2002.\n(3) The Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements establish a contractual trade regime between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, respectively, with bilateral trade concessions which on the Community side are equivalent to the concessions applicable within the unilateral autonomous trade measures under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000. Moreover, textiles products originating in the Republic of Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, have been granted unlimited duty-free access and specific bilateral concessions for fisheries products and \"baby-beef\" have been defined.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 to take into account these developments. In particular, it is appropriate to remove the Republic of Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from the list of beneficiaries of the tariff concessions granted for the same products under the contractual regimes. In addition, it will be necessary to reduce the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas have been granted under the contractual regimes.\n(5) The Republic of Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will remain a beneficiary of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 only in so far as the Regulation provides for concessions which are more favourable than the concessions existing under the contractual regimes.\n(6) Additional Protocols including reciprocal preferential concessions for certain wines, reciprocal recognition, protection and control of wine names and reciprocal recognition, protection and control of designations for spirits and aromatised drinks are also in the process of being concluded with the Republic of Croatia(3) the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(4) and the Republic of Slovenia(5), (hereinafter referred to as \"Additional Protocols on wine\"), and should apply as of 1 January 2002. Within the Additional Protocols on wine, individual tariff quotas have been provided out of the global tariff quota of 545000 hl opened within Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, for imports into the Community of wine originating in the Republic of Croatia (45000 hl), in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (300000 hl) and in the Republic of Slovenia (48000 hl).\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 in order to deduct the volumes of the individual tariff quotas from the volume of the global tariff quota and to specify the conditions for the access to the remaining volume of the global tariff quota. In particular the consequence will be that access to the tariff quota for wine under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 to the Republic of Slovenia should be suspended and that access to the Republic of Croatia and to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be subject to the prior utilisation of the individual tariff quotas respectively provided for in the Additional Protocols on wine with these countries.\n(8) The individual tariff quotas provided for certain wines originating in the Republic of Croatia and in the Republic of Slovenia will be progressively increased subject to specific conditions indicated in the Additional Protocols on wine. In particular, the yearly increase of the volumes of these individual tariff quotas is subject to using up a minimum volume of 80 % of the individual tariff quotas opened within the previous year. Therefore, the Commission should review the volumes used each year and should adopt provisions to implement any necessary adjustment of these volumes for Croatia and Slovenia, and accordingly, of the global tariff quota applicable under order No 09.1515.\n(9) An Agreement on trade in textile products with Bosnia and Herzegovina which had applied provisionally since 1 March 2001 was signed on 27 June 2001. This agreement established that exports from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Community will be free from quantitative limits and measures of equivalent effect and put in place a double-checking system. A similar Agreement, provisionally applied since 1 January 2001, was also signed with Croatia on 17 May 2001.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
