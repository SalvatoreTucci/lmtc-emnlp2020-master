The same holds for products which, by virtue of being either the subject of a binding tariff reduction under the WTO or some other preferential arrangements, must comply with a reference price.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 29(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the reference price for the products listed in Annex I, Parts A and B to that Regulation, is to be the same as the withdrawal price fixed in accordance with Article 20(1) of that Regulation.\n(3) The Union withdrawal prices for the products concerned are fixed for the 2013 fishing year by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 232/2013\u00a0(2).\n(4) Pursuant to Article 29(3)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the reference price for products other than those listed in Annexes I and II to that Regulation is to be established in particular on the basis of the weighted average of customs values recorded on the import markets or in the ports of import in the three years immediately preceding the date on which the reference price is fixed.\n(5) There is no need to fix reference prices for those products falling under the criteria laid down in Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 which are imported from third countries in insignificant volumes.\n(6) In order to allow a swift application of the reference prices in the year 2013, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 104/2000,", "main_body": ["The reference prices for the 2013 fishing year of fishery products, as referred to in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 17, 21.1.2000, p. 22.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0See page 1 of this Official Journal.\nANNEX\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference prices for fishery products referred to in Article 29(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000\nSpecies Size\u00a0(1) Reference price\nGutted with head\u00a0(1) Whole fish\u00a0(1)\nAdditional Taric code Extra, A\u00a0(1) Additional Taric code Extra, A\u00a0(1)\nHerring of the species 1  \u2014 F011 136\n2 \u2014 F012 208\n3 \u2014 F013 197\n4a \u2014 F016 124\n4b \u2014 F017 124\n4c \u2014 F018 260\n5 \u2014 F015 231\n6 \u2014 F019 116\n7a \u2014 F025 116\n7b \u2014 F026 104\n8 \u2014 F027 87\nRedfish 1  \u2014 F067 996\n2 \u2014 F068 996\n3 \u2014 F069 836\nCod of the species 1 F073 1\u00a0161 F083 839\n2 F074 1\u00a0161 F084 839\n3 F075 1\u00a0097 F085 645\n4 F076 871 F086 484\n5 F077 613 F087 355\nBoiled in water Fresh or refrigerated\nAdditional Taric code Extra, A\u00a0(1) Additional Taric code Extra, A\u00a0(1)\nDeepwater prawns 1 F317 5\u00a0394 F321 1\u00a0114\n2 F318 1\u00a0891 \u2014 \u2014\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference prices for fishery products referred to in Article 29(3)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000\nProduct Additional Taric code Presentation Reference price\n1.
