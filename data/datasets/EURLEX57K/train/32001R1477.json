Article 6(1) of that Regulation provides that delivery must take place by the end of the second month following receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August of the current marketing year.\n(2) During the 2000/01 marketing year, the intervention agencies encountered difficulties in setting up a satisfactory system for the storage, inspection and reception of the goods. As a result of those difficulties, the acceptance of offers submitted and the taking-over of deliveries have fallen behind schedule. Those difficulties justify an extension of the period for delivery to the intervention agency for the 2000/01 marketing year.\n(3) In view of the situation facing the intervention agencies, this Regulation must enter into force immediately.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 708/98, delivery in respect of the 2000/01 marketing year must take place by no later than the end of the third month following that of receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August 2001.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 3.\n(3) OJ L 98, 31.3.1998, p. 21.\n(4) OJ L 90, 30.3.2001, p. 17."}
