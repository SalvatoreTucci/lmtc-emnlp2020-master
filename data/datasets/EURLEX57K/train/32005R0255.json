Such applications therefore shall continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Bacillus cereus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999\u00a0(3).\n(6) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (DSM 10663/NCIMB 10415) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for calves by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999\u00a0(4).\n(7) New data were submitted in support of these applications for authorisation without a time limit of those two micro-organism preparations specified in Annex I to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.\n(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (NRRL 25541) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for laying hens, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(5).\n(9) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of this enzyme preparation.\n(10) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered an opinion dated on 14 September 2004 about the efficacy of the use of this preparation for laying hens.\n(11) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.\n(12) The use of the enzyme preparation of 6-phytase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 11857) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1353/2000\u00a0(6), and for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 261/2003\u00a0(7). The use of this enzyme preparation was authorised without a time limit for these animal categories by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1465/2004\u00a0(8).\n(13) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of a preparation of the same enzyme preparation produced by the strain DSM 14223 of Aspergillus oryzae for the same animal categories.\n(14) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation when produced from Aspergillus oryzae strain DSM 14223 instead of strain DSM 11857 which concludes that this preparation does not present a risk to human health, the animal categories specified or the environment, under the conditions set out in the Annex II to this Regulation.\n(15) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation without a time limit of such preparation have been satisfied.\n(16) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 270.95) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 and, for turkeys for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 654/2000\u00a0(9).\n(17) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of this enzyme preparation.\n(18) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.\n(19) Accordingly, the use of those three enzyme preparations as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(20) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(10).\n(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019 are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex I.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019 are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 February 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
