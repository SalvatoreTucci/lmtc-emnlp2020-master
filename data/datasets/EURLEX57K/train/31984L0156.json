The limit values shall normally apply at the point where waste waters containing mercury leave the industrial plant.\nWhen waste waters containing mercury are treated outside the industrial plant at a treatment plant intended for the removal of mercury, the Member State may permit the limit values to be applied at the point where the waste waters leave the treatment plant.\n3. The authorizations referred to in Article 3 of Directive 76/464/EEC must contain provisions at least as stringent as those in Annex I to this Directive, except where a Member State is complying with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC on the basis of Annex II to this Directive and Annex IV to Directive 82/176/EEC.\nAuthorizations shall be reviewed at least every four years.\n4. Without prejudice to their obligations arising from paragraph 1, 2 and 3 and to the provisions of Directive 76/464/EEC, Member States may grant authorizations for new plants only if those plants apply the standards corresponding to the best technical means available when that is necessary for the elimination of pollution in accordance with Article 2 of the said Directive or for the prevention of distortion of competition.\nWhatever method it adopts, the Member State shall, where for technical reasons the intended measures do not correspond to the best technical means available, provide the Commission, before any authorization, with evidence in support of these reasons.\nThe Commission shall forward this evidence to the other Member States immediately and shall send all Member States a report as soon as possible giving its opinion on the derogation referred to in the second subparagraph. If necessary, it shall at the same time submit appropriate proposals to the Council.\n5. The reference method of analysis to be used in determining the presence of mercury is given in Annex III (1) to Directive 82/176/EEC. Other methods may be used provided that the limits of detection, precision and accuracy of such methods are at least as good as those laid down in Annex III (1) to Directive 82/176/EEC. The accuracy required in the measurement of effluent flow is given in Annex III (2) to that Directive.", "1. The Member States shall draw up specific programmes for mercury discharges by multiple sources which are not industrial plants and for which the emission standards laid down in Article 3 cannot be applied in practice.\n2. The purpose of these programmes shall be to avoid or eliminate pollution. They shall include the most appropriate measures and techniques for the replacement, retention and recycling of mercury. The elimination of waste containing mercury shall be carried out in accordance with Council Directive 78/319/EEC of 20 March 1978 on toxic and dangerous waste (1), as amended by the 1979 Act of Accession.\n3.

The limit values and the time limits for the industrial sectors concerned are set out together in the table below:\n1.2,3.4 //   //   //   //   // Limit value which must be complied with as from:  //   //  1.2.3.4 // Industrial sector (1)  // 1 July 1986  // 1 July 1989  // Unit of measurement  //   //   //   //   // 1.

Plants for the treatment of toxic wastes containing mercury  // 0,1  // 0,05  // mg/l effluent  //   //  //   //\n(1) Limit values for industrial sectors other than the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry which are not mentioned in this table, such as the paper and steel industries or coal-fired power stations, will, if necessary, be fixed by the Council at a later stage. In the meantime, the Member States will fix emission standards for mercury discharges autonomously in accordance with Directive 76/464/EEC. Such standards must take into account the best technical means available and must not be less stringent than the most nearly comparable limit value in this Annex.\n(2) On the basis of experience gained in the implementation of this Directive the Commission will, pursuant to Article 6 (3), submit to the Council proposals for more stringent limit values to be introduced 10 years after the notification of this Directive.\nThe limit values given in the table correspond to a monthly average concentration or to a maximum monthly load.\nThe amounts of mercury discharged are expressed as a function of the amount of mercury used or handled by the industrial plant over the same period or as a function of the installed vinyl chloride production capacity. 2. Limit values expressed as concentrations which in principle must not be exceeded are given in the above table for the industrial sectors 1 to 4. In no instance may limit values expressed as maximum concentrations be greater than those expressed as maximum quantities divided by water requirements per kilogram of mercury handled or per tonne of installed vinyl chloride production capacity.\nHowever, because the concentration of mercury in effluents depends on the volume of water involved, which differs for different processes and plants, the limit values, expressed in terms of the quantity of mercury discharged in relation to the quantity of mercury handled or to the installed vinyl chloride production capacity, given in the above table, must be complied with in all cases.\n3. The daily average limit values are twice the corresponding monthly average limit values given in the table.\n4. A monitoring procedure must be instituted to check whether the discharges comply with the emission standards which have been fixed in accordance with the limit values laid down in this Annex.\nThis procedure must provide for the taking and analysis of samples and for measurement of the flow of the discharge and, where appropriate, the quantity of mercury handled.\nShould the quantity of mercury handled be impossible to determine, the monitoring procedure may be based on the quantity of mercury that may be used in the light of the production capacity on which the authorization was based.\n5. A sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours will be taken. The quantity of mercury discharged over a month must be calculated on the basis of the daily quantities of mercury discharged.\nHowever, a simplified monitoring procedure may be instituted in the case of industrial plants which do not discharge more than 7,5 kilograms of mercury per annum.\nANNEX  II\nQuality objectives\nFor those Member States which apply the exception referred to in Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the emission standards which Member States must establish and ensure are applied, pursuant to Article 5 of that Directive, will be fixed so that the appropriate quality objective or objectives from among those listed in sections 1, 2 and 3 of Annex II to Directive 82/176/EEC is or are complied with in the area affected by discharges of mercury.\nThe competent authority shall determine the area affected in each case and shall select from among the quality objectives listed in section 1 of Annex II to Directive 82/176/EEC the objective or objectives that it deems appropriate having regard to the intended use of the area affected, while taking account of the fact that the purpose of this Directive is to avoid or eliminate all pollution.\nThe numerical values of the quality objectives specified in 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of Annex II to Directive 82/176/EEC may, as an exception and where this is necessary for technical reasons, be multiplied by 1.5 until 1 July 1989, provided that the Commission has been notified beforehand."}
