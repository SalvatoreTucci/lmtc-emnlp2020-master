This prohibition applies to all Community fishing vessels with the exception of those operating in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the \u00d8resund.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 of 26 April 2004 laying down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries\u00a0(2) sets out requirements concerning the use of acoustic deterrent devices and the monitoring of incidental catches of cetaceans in certain drift net fisheries.\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the \u00d8resund\u00a0(3) sets out the restrictions and conditions on the use drift nets in this regulated area.\n(4) Those Regulations do not however contain a definition of drift nets.
