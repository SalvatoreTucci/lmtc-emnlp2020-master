This assessment indicates that the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plans will allow the companies concerned to reach viability under normal market conditions. It also shows that the amount of State aid for restructuring purposes as specified in the plans is strictly limited to what is necessary to allow the companies concerned to reach viability and has been progressively reduced and stopped since the end of 2004. The assessment provides also that a global rationalisation and reduction of excess capacity of the beneficiary companies will be reached. The assessment therefore concludes that the restructuring programme and the business plans meet the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement,", "main_body": ["The restructuring programme and business plans submitted to the Commission by Romania pursuant to Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement, are in compliance with the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2.", "The period, during which Romania may exceptionally, as regards steel products, grant public aid for restructuring purposes in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 is hereby extended by an additional period of eight years starting on 1 January 1998, as provided for by Article 1 of the Additional Protocol."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
