As a consequence, the relevant acts in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters cease to apply to the United Kingdom on\u00a01\u00a0December\u00a02014.\n(3) The United Kingdom may notify its wish to participate in the acts which have ceased to apply to it.\n(4) The United Kingdom has indicated its intention to notify its wish to participate in some of those acts.\n(5) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(4) of Protocol No 36, the Council should, on a proposal from the Commission, determine the necessary consequential and transitional arrangements. The Council may also, on the basis of the third subparagraph of Article 10(4), determine that the United Kingdom should bear the direct financial consequences necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of the cessation of its participation in those acts.\n(6) Any disruption in the implementation and application of the acts which the United\u00a0Kingdom has sought to rejoin should be avoided. Those acts should therefore continue to apply to the United Kingdom for a limited transitional period until the decisions of the Council and the Commission authorising the participation of the United\u00a0Kingdom take\u00a0effect.\n(7) As the United Kingdom has not notified the Council of its wish to participate in Council Decisions 2008/615/JHA\u00a0(1) and 2008/616/JHA\u00a0(2) and Council Framework Decision\u00a02009/905/JHA\u00a0(3) (hereinafter \u2018the Pr\u00fcm Decisions\u2019), they will cease to apply to the United Kingdom as from 1 December 2014. As a consequence of the cessation of their application, and until such time as the United Kingdom rejoins the Pr\u00fcm Decisions, it should be prevented from accessing for law enforcement purposes the Eurodac database set up under Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4).\n(8) However, given the practical and operational significance of the Pr\u00fcm Decisions to the Union for public security, and more particularly for law enforcement and the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences, the United Kingdom should, in close consultation with operational partners in the United Kingdom, the Member States, the Commission, Europol and Eurojust, undertake a full business and implementation case in order to assess the merits and practical benefits of the United Kingdom rejoining the Pr\u00fcm Decisions and the necessary steps for it to do so, the results of which should be published by 30 September 2015.\n(9) If the above business and implementation case is positive, the United Kingdom should decide, by 31 December 2015, on whether to notify the Council, within the following four weeks, of its wish to participate in the Pr\u00fcm Decisions, in accordance with Article 10(5) of Protocol No 36. The United Kingdom has indicated that a positive vote in its Parliament is required before such decision is taken.\n(10) The rules on the financial consequences incurred as a result of the cessation of the participation of the United Kingdom in the Pr\u00fcm Decisions will be provided for in Council Decision 2014/837/EU\u00a0(5).\n(11) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(4) of Protocol No 36, the United Kingdom is not participating in the adoption of this Decision, but is bound by it,", "main_body": ["The acts which are listed in the Annex shall continue to apply to the United Kingdom until\u00a07\u00a0December 2014.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within 10 days of 30 November 2014, the United Kingdom shall begin to undertake a full business and implementation case in order to assess the merits and practical benefits of the United\u00a0Kingdom rejoining the Pr\u00fcm Decisions and the necessary steps for it to do so.\nIt shall do so in close consultation with operational partners in the United Kingdom, the Member States, the Commission, Europol and Eurojust.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 30 September 2015, the United Kingdom shall publish the results of the business and implementation case referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the business and implementation case is positive, the United Kingdom shall decide by\u00a031\u00a0December 2015 whether to notify the Council of its wish to participate in the Pr\u00fcm Decisions in accordance with Article 10(5) of Protocol No 36.
