Experience acquired in applying this Regulation should reveal the extent to which these regulations should, or should not, be supplemented by further rules.\n(3) Experience has shown that a political party at European level will have as its members either citizens gathered together in the form of a political party or political parties which together form an alliance. The terms \"political party\" and \"alliance of political parties\" used in this Regulation should therefore be clarified.\n(4) In order to be able to identify a \"political party at European level\", it is important to set certain conditions. In particular, it is necessary for political parties at European level to observe the principles on which the European Union is founded, as set out in the Treaties and recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(5) The procedure to be followed by political parties at European level which wish to receive funding pursuant to this Regulation should be laid down.\n(6) Provision should also be made for regular verification of the conditions applied for identifying a political party at European level.\n(7) Political parties at European level which have received funding under this Regulation should submit to obligations aimed at ensuring transparency of sources of funding.\n(8) In accordance with Declaration No 11 on Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Nice, the funding granted pursuant to this Regulation should not be used to fund, either directly or indirectly, political parties at national level. By virtue of same declaration, the provisions on the funding of political parties at European level should apply, on the same basis, to all the political forces represented in the European Parliament.\n(9) The nature of the expenditure that can be funded under this Regulation should be defined.\n(10) The appropriations allocated to funding under this Regulation should be determined in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure.\n(11) It is necessary to ensure maximum transparency and financial control of political parties at European level funded from the general budget of the European Union.\n(12) A scale should be set for distributing the appropriations available each year, taking into account, on the one hand, the number of beneficiaries and, on the other, the number of elected members in the European Parliament.\n(13) Technical assistance to be afforded by the European Parliament to political parties at European level should be guided by the principle of equal treatment.\n(14) The application of this Regulation and the activities funded should be examined in a report from the European Parliament which should be published.\n(15) The judicial control which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice will help ensure the correct application of this Regulation.\n(16) In order to facilitate transition towards the new rules, the application of some of the provisions of this Regulation should be postponed until the European Parliament has been formed after the elections due in June 2004,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes rules on the regulations governing political parties at European level and rules regarding their funding.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1. \"political party\" means an association of citizens:\n- which pursues political objectives, and\n- which is either recognised by, or established in accordance with, the legal order of at least one Member State;\n2. \"alliance of political parties\" means structured cooperation between at least two political parties;\n3. \"political party at European level\" means a political party or an alliance of political parties which satisfies the conditions referred to in Article 3.", "Conditions\nA political party at European level shall satisfy the following conditions:\n(a) it must have legal personality in the Member State in which its seat is located;\n(b) it must be represented, in at least one quarter of Member States, by Members of the European Parliament or in the national Parliaments or regional Parliaments or in the regional assemblies, or\nit must have received, in at least one quarter of the Member States, at least three per cent of the votes cast in each of those Member States at the most recent European Parliament elections;\n(c) it must observe, in particular in its programme and in its activities, the principles on which the European Union is founded, namely the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law;\n(d) it must have participated in elections to the European Parliament, or have expressed the intention to do so.", "Application for funding\n1.
