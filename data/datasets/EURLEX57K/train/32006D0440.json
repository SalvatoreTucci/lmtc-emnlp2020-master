The Common Consular Instructions and the Common Manual should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(2) Council Decision 2003/454/EC of 13 June 2003 amending Annex 12 to the Common Consular Instructions and Annex 14a to the Common Manual on visa fees\u00a0(4) fixed the amount to be charged corresponding to the administrative costs of processing visa applications at EUR 35.\n(3) Recital 2 of Decision 2003/454/EC established that the amount to be charged should be revised at regular intervals.\n(4) The amount of EUR 35 no longer covers current visa application processing costs. Moreover, the consequences of the introduction of the European Visa Information System (VIS) and the biometrics required to introduce the VIS in the visa application examining process should be taken into account.\n(5) The current amount of EUR 35 should be readjusted accordingly in order to cover the additional costs of processing the visa application corresponding to the introduction of biometrics and the VIS.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No \u2026/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention\u00a0(5) allows for the local border traffic permit to be issued free of charge.\n(7) Recommendation 2005/761/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 September 2005 to facilitate the issue by the Member States of uniform short-stay visas for researchers from third countries travelling within the Community for the purpose of carrying out scientific research\u00a0(6) encourages the issue of visas without administrative fees for researchers.\n(8) Waiving or reducing the fees to be charged for nationals of certain third countries in addition to the exceptions mentioned in Article 2 of this Decision may be the subject of agreements between the European Community and the third countries concerned consistent with the Community's overall approach to visa facilitation agreements.\n(9) Member States should make maximum use of the possibilities offered by the Schengen acquis for the purpose of developing people-to-people contact with the neighbouring countries consistent with overall EU policy objectives.\n(10) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

The Council and Commission also request that the impact of the new measures for this purpose be kept under review.\nSTATEMENT BY THE COUNCIL\nOn the basis of the process and considerations laid down in the common approach on visa facilitation based on a case-by-case assessment of the countries concerned, and having regard to Rule II.3 of this Decision, the Council invites the Commission to bring forward recommendations for mandates for initiating negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements, starting with the countries with a European perspective as referred to in the European Council Conclusions of June 2003 and June 2005."}
