In this respect, the Commission recalls that the most important factors of the injury caused by the dumped imports were the rapid  increase in volume and the high margin of price undercutting. In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that, administratively, it will be possible to verify that the undertakings are being complied with. That being so, the Commission considers that  the undertakings offered are acceptable and that the investigation concerning the exporters in question may be closed without the imposition of anti-dumping duties.\n(4) Should the undertakings in question not be complied with, or should they be withdrawn by the exporters concerned, the Commission could, in accordance with Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, impose provisional duties forthwith on the  basis of the results and conclusions of the investigation set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1189/93. Subsequently, definitive duties could also be imposed by the Council on the basis of the facts established in that investigation.\n(5) No objections to the acceptance of the undertakings were raised within the Advisory Committee.\n(6) The Community industry concerned was informed of the main facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to accept the undertakings and did not object to them,", "main_body": ["The undertakings offered by:\nHungary:\nCsepel Tube Works, Budapest;\nPoland:\nCentrozap, Foreign Trade Company Ltd, Katowice,\nHuta Andrzej, Zawadzkle,\nStalexport, Foreign Trade Enterprise, Katowice,\nHuta Im M.
