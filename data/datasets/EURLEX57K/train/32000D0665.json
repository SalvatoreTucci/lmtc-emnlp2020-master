This authorisation was granted for a period ending on 31 December 2000.\n(6) Under the Agreement on Agriculture concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations(5), the Community replaced the special trade arrangements with third countries on imports of products in the sheep and beef sector by a system of quotas. However, it is desirable in the light of experience gained during the application of Decision 82/530/EEC to extend the system of special import licences for a further period with the possibility of further reviewing the situation before the end of that period and without prejudice to the international obligations of the Community. Article 2 of Decision 82/530/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Decision 82/530/EEC is hereby replaced by the following:\n\"Article 2\nThis Decision shall apply until 31 December 2005.\nBefore 1 July 2005 the Commission shall present to the Council a report on the application of the system, together with any proposals for the retention of, or amendment to, this Decision.\"", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 23 October 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
