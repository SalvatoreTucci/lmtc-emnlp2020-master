Furthermore, Member States may in agreement with the Commission, include in the survey permanent part-time workers, having regard to their relative importance.\n4. Definitions of the various categories of workers referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 are given in Annex II.", "The survey shall be conducted on the basis of statistical data relating to the months of September, October or November in the case of permanent workers, and to months designated by the Commission, in cooperation with the national statistical authorities of the Member States, in the case of seasonal workers.", "The survey shall, within the terms laid down in Article 1, cover all holdings which employ permanent and/or seasonal workers and which engage in activities specified and defined under Class 01 of the General Nomenclature of Economic Activities in the European Communities (NACE), with the  exception of holdings the activities of which consist exclusively or mainly in creating and maintaining gardens and parks, in hunting or in activities ancillary to agriculture.", "The survey shall be carried out by random sampling.

M\u00d8LLER\nANNEX I Categories of workers referred to in Article 1\n1. For Belgium, Denmark, Germany (except for the L\u00e4nder of Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg andSaar), France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom : permanentfull-time workers.\n2. For Greece : permanent and seasonal workers.\nANNEX II Definitions of the categories of workers referred to in Article 1\n1. A \"permanent worker\" means a manual worker who is not a member of the family of thefarmer and who is in permanent employment on the holding, by which is meant employmentthat is continuous and regular, either full-time or part-time, throughout the year.\nThe worker concerned is a wage earner in the strict sense of the term, being a worker who ispaid regularly and who, on the basis of an oral or written contract of employment, works\"throughout the year\", subject, of course, to the seasonal variations inherent in agriculturalwork.      (a) a \"permanent full-time worker\" is a worker who, under the terms of his employmentagreement, is bound to work throughout the year for a number of hours equal to orgreater than the contractual or usual hours of work.\n(b) a \"permanent part-time worker\" is a worker who, under the terms of his contract ofemployment, is required to work throughout the year for a number of hours which issmaller than the contractual or usual number of hours of work, but greater than 15 hoursper week. Part-time work does not necessarily mean half-time work ; it may be variedaccording to a daily, weekly or monthly pattern to suit the needs of the agriculturalholding.\nThe distinction between a permanent full-time worker and a permanent part-time workerwill be made by reference to the working year and by reference to the month of the surveyonly. For example, a worker who is required to work an average of 40 hours per weekthroughout the year (contractual or usual number of hours of work), but has worked only20 hours in the survey month, will be deemed to be a permanent full-time worker.\n2. A \"seasonal worker\" is a manual worker who is not a member of the family of the farmer andwho is in temporary employment on the holding, by which is meant employment for aperiod confined to a part of the year and involving well-defined duties.\nThe worker concerned is a wage earner in the strict sense of the term, being a worker who isemployed on the basis of an oral or written contract of employment."}
