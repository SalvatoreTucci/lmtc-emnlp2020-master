whereas these reference prices must be fixed on the basis of the guide price for the types of red and white table wine most representative of Community production plus the costs incurred in bringing Community wines to the same marketing stage as imported wines;\nWhereas the types of table wine most representative of Community production are types R I and A I as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 340/79 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85; whereas the guide prices for these types of wine as given in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1470/86 (4) have been set at the same level as that adopted for the preceding marketing year;\nWhereas the third subparagraph of Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 provides that reference prices are also to be fixed for grape juice (including grape must) falling within subheading 20.07 B I of the Common Customs Tariff, for concentrated grape juice (including grape must) falling within subheadings 20.07 A I and B I of the Common Customs Tariff, for alcohol-muted fresh grape must as defined in Additional Note 4 (a) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, for wines fortified for distillation as defined in Additional Note 4 (b) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, and for liqueur wines as defined in Additional Note 4 (c) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff;\nWhereas, since special reference prices are to be fixed for products in accordance with their special characteristics or uses, such prices should be fixed for wines of the Riesling or Sylvaner variety and for liqueur wines to be used in the preparation of products other than those falling within heading No 22.05 of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas, lastly, standard amounts corresponding to the normal costs of market preparation must be established for addition to the reference prices for the various products in cases where these are put up either in containers of not more than two litres or in containers of more than two but not more than 20 litres;\nWhereas the reference prices for liqueur wines, which are fixed by the hectolitre, must be established having regard to the price level ruling in the Community for the product in question; whereas a total dry extract exceeding the normal limits is a characteristic feature of certain liqueur wines falling within subheading 22.05 C II of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas, pursuant to the rules in Additional Note 3 C to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, the said liqueur wines are not classified in the category corresponding to their alcoholic strength but in the next higher category, and are therefore subject to a higher reference price than that fixed for the category which corresponds to their alcoholic strength; whereas, moreover, the mechanism referred to above does not apply to certain competing liqueur wines falling within subheadings 22.05 C III and 22.05 C IV; whereas, in view of the large volume of imports of the said wines, reference prices should be fixed for these wines so as to ensure equality of treatment between the various liqueur wines;\nWhereas the fifth subparagraph of Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 makes provision for the reference price to be adjusted for the non-European parts of the Community; whereas the market situation is such that an adjustment is necessary only for the French overseas department of R\u0102\u0160union;\nWhereas the costs, with the exception of those in respect of losses incurred in bringing Community wines to the same marketing stage as imported wines, to be established as specified in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 344/79 (5), may be assessed at a standard rate; whereas there has been no substantial increase in these costs and the other factors to be considered since the last occasion on which prices were fixed;\nWhereas the reference prices should be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 344/79; whereas, having regard to the aims of the\nCommunity's wine-growing policy and the contribution which the Community intends to make to the harmonious development of world trade, the reference prices for the 1986/87 marketing year and the standard amount should be fixed at the same levels as those adopted for the previous marketing year;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["For the 1986/87 marketing year, the reference prices shall be as follows:\nA.
