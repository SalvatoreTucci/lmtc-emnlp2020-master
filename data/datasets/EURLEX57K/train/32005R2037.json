This additive is currently authorised in the group \u2018coccidiostats\u2019 for turkeys by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3) and chickens reared for laying and chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1455/2004\u00a0(4). This additive has been notified as existing product on the basis of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and is subject to the verifications and the procedures in application of that provision.\n(2) The company concerned submitted a new supplementary dossier requesting a modification of existing carrier.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility to modify the authorisation of an additive further to an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) on whether the authorisation still meets the conditions set out in that Regulation.\n(4) The Commission asked the Authority to evaluate the relevant data supporting the application for the change of authorisation referred to in Regulations (EC) Nos 2430/1999 and 1455/2004 and to advise on the possible harmful effects on safety and efficacy when lasalocid A sodium is used by new carrier. Following this request, the Authority has published on 26 August 2005 an opinion on the use of lasalocid A sodium in feedingstuffs.\n(5) The opinion of the Authority concludes that the use of the new formulation would not be expected to introduce any additional risks or concerns for human, animal and environmental safety and that the new formulation does not adversely influence the stability of lasalocid A sodium.\n(6) A Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for substance concerned has been established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990\u00a0(5) laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue levels of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin.\n(7) Regulations (EC) Nos 2430/1999 and 1455/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999, the entry relating to E 763, lasalocid A sodium, is replaced by the text in Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1455/2004 is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
