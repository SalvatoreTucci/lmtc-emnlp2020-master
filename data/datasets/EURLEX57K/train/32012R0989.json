The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) as a feed additive for laying hens and minor poultry species for fattening and laying, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of those enzymes was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009\u00a0(2) and for 10 years for weaned piglets by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1088/2011\u00a0(3).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) for laying hens and minor poultry species for fattening and laying. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 23 May 2012\u00a0(4) that the use of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that the use of that preparation can significantly increase egg mass and can improve feed to eggs mass ratio in laying hens and minor poultry species for laying and can improve the zootechnical parameters in minor poultry species for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase as specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, are authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 October 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 14.11.2009, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 281, 28.10.2011, p. 14.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012;10(6):2728.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
