Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health within the Union and it is therefore appropriate as a precautionary measure to urgently take measures at Union level to ensure the safety of the feed and food, including fish and fishery products, originating in or consigned from Japan. As the accident is not yet under control, it is at this stage appropriate that the required testing before export would apply to feed and food originating from the affected prefectures with a buffer zone and a random testing of feed and food at import originating from the whole territory of Japan.\n(3) Maximum levels have been established by Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency\u00a0(2), Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 944/89 of 12 April 1989 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in minor foodstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 770/90 of 29 March 1990 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency\u00a0(4).\n(4) These maximum levels can be rendered applicable after the Commission is informed of a nuclear accident substantiating that the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs are likely to be reached or have been reached pursuant to Council Decision 87/600/Euratom of 14 December 1987 on Community arrangements for the early exchange of information in the event of radiological emergency\u00a0(5) or under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Convention on early notification of a nuclear accident of 26 September 1986. In the meantime it is appropriate to use these pre\u2013established maximum levels as reference values to judge the acceptability to place feed and food on the market.\n(5) The Japanese authorities have informed the Commission services that appropriate testing is carried out on food products from the affected region exported from Japan.\n(6) In addition to the testing carried out by the Japanese authorities, it is appropriate to foresee random controls on such imports.\n(7) It is appropriate that Member States inform the Commission of all analytical results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and the European Union's Urgent Radiological Information Exchange system (ECURIE). The measures will be reviewed on the basis of these analytical results.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to feedstuffs and foodstuffs within the meaning of Article 1 (2) of Regulation 3954/87 originating in or consigned from Japan, with the exclusion of products which left Japan before 28 March 2011 and of products which have been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011.", "Attestation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All consignments of the products referred to in Article 1 shall be subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consignments of the products referred to in Article 1 falling outside the scope of Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community for third countries\u00a0(6) shall be introduced into the EU through a designated point of entry (hereinafter \u2018DPE\u2019) within the meaning of Article 3 (b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC\u00a0(7).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each consignment of the products referred to in Article 1 shall be accompanied by a declaration, attesting that\n\u2014 the product has been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011, or\n\u2014 the product is originating from a prefecture other than Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo and Chiba, or\n\u2014 in case the product is originating from the prefectures Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Yamagata, Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo and Chiba, the product does not contain levels of the radionuclides iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the maximum levels provided for in Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987, Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 944/89 of 12 April 1989 and Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 770/90 of 29 March 1990.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The model of the declaration referred to in paragraph 3 is set out in the Annex.
