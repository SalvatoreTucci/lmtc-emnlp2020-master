These methods, and the limit values for the characteristics of oils, must be updated on the basis of the opinion of chemical experts and in line with the work carried out within the International Olive Oil Council.\n(2) In particular, the chemical experts have concluded that the quantification of the percentage of 2-glyceryl monopalmitate is more precise for the detection of esterified oils. Decreasing the limit value for stigmastadiene in virgin olive oils also makes it possible to achieve better separation of virgin olive oils and refined olive oils.\n(3) In order to allow a period of adjustment to the new standards, to give time for introducing the means of applying them and to avoid disturbance to commercial transactions, the amendments to this Regulation should not apply until 1 January 2008. For the same reasons, provision should be made for olive oil and olive-residue oils that are legally manufactured and labelled in the Community or legally imported into the Community and released for free circulation before that date to be marketed until all stocks are used up.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Olive Oil and Table Olives,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 is amended as follows:\n1.
