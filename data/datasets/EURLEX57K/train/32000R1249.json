The specific aid is paid on the basis of deliveries which may be made up to 30 April of the year following that of harvest and, therefore, certain producer organisations have difficulties using the specific aid in full within the following two months and meeting the 30 June deadline. A longer period should therefore be laid down for using the specific aid. Moreover, to ensure that unused amounts are paid back within the given deadlines, the Member States should be obliged to recover any unused amounts from producer organisations.\n(2) Article 42(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 allows the Member States to pay producer organisations an advance on the specific aid on the basis of the quantities of tobacco delivered to the processor. To allow an actual advance to be granted, the application for an advance should be based on the quantities of tobacco covered by cultivation contracts rather than waiting for the deliverey of the product, bearing in mind that the advance is paid on condition that a security is lodged equal to 115 % of that advance. The advance should however be limited to 50 % of those quantities.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Tobacco,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
