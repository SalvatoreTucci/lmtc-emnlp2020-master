The capacity of these vessels (7419 GRT, 18457 kW) was therefore excluded from the situation on 1 January 1992 in order to calculate the objectives for  1996 for the other segments. The objectives 1996 for this segment are to stabilize capacity to the situation at 1 January 1992. The revision envisaged in footnote (4) will not affect the global capacity of the French tropical freezer fleet.\n(4) The objectives defined for this segment will be reconsidered in the light of an examination of the state of the available resources, and in particular the offshore pelagic resources. To this end a study compiling the results of research on these  resources in relation to their accessibility to the fleet registered in the French Overseas Departments is to be undertaken by France. The results will be made available to the Commission for the mid term review. This revision may take into account the  capacity of small fishing vessels not yet registered, as well as bring the safety of the small vessels up to standard."}
