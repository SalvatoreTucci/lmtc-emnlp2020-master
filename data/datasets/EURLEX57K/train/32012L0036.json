In this context, driving entitlements acquired before Directive 2006/126/EC applies, on 19 January 2013, should be maintained.\n(2) The contents of the driving licence test for vehicles of category C1 vehicles should be adapted to the different characteristics of the vehicles falling under this category. Contrary to category C vehicles, which are dedicated to professional transport of goods, category C1 is heterogeneous and includes a wide range of vehicles, such as vehicles for leisure or personal use, emergency or fire-fighting vehicles, or utility vehicles used for professional purposes but where driving is not the principal activity of the driver. Drivers of such vehicles should not be required to demonstrate during the driving test their knowledge of rules or equipment only applicable to drivers subject to the legislation related to the professional transport sector, such as Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport\u00a0(3) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 of 20 December 1985 on recording equipment in road transport\u00a0(4). Such an accommodation of existing rules would reduce the risk that drivers drive with overloaded category B vehicles in order to avoid the costs of training and taking the test on C or C1 vehicles, and thus improve road safety. It would also minimise the administrative and financial burden on the SMEs and micro-enterprises having to use such utility vehicles in the course of their business.\n(3) The requirements concerning test vehicles motorcycles of category A1, A2 and A to be used during the test of skills and behaviour need to be revised in the light of the technical progress, in particular the development and a wider use of electric motorcycles. The technical specifications for the test vehicles should also be adapted to ensure that applicants are tested on vehicles which are representative of the category for which the driving licence would be issued.\n(4) The minimum requirements for test vehicles and for the contents of the test of skills and behaviour for category C and D vehicles should be amended in the light of technical progress, in particular to take into account the increasing development and use in the transport industry of more modern, safer and less polluting vehicles equipped with a wide range of semi-automatic or hybrid transmission systems. The competence of drivers should be tested on their abilities to use the transmission system of vehicles safely, economically and in an environmentally friendly way. The simplification of the current restrictions to drive automatic vehicles would also reduce the administrative and financial burden on SMEs and micro-enterprises operating in the road transport.\n(5) Since Directive 2006/126/EC will fully apply on 19 January 2013 this Directive shall enter into force as from the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(6) Directive 2006/126/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on driving licences,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Directive 2006/126/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2013 at the latest.
