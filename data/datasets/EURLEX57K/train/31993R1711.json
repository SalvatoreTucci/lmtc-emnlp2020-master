Samples are taken from several parts of the means of transport used and at three different levels, namely the upper, middle and lower levels.\nThe residual earth is discharged before the means of transport is weighed empty.\nSamples taken for weight checking should weigh not less than 20 kilograms. The tubers are washed, cleaned of any extraneous matter and re-weighed.\nThe recorded weight is reduced by 2 % to allow for the quantity of water absorbed during washing. The result constitutes the total reduction to be applied to 1 000 kilograms of potatoes.\nMethod B  The potatoes constituting a batch from a single grower are collected in silos.\nThe potatoes are washed, the extraneous matter is removed and the total actual weight of the potatoes in the silos is determined, allowing 2 % for absorbed water.\nMethod C  1. This method of determining the actual weight of the potatoes shall apply where batches of potatoes from different growers are collected in the same silo, provided that the growers have first agreed to the use of this method.\nBefore the total actual weight of the batches is determined, the net weight of each batch must be determined by means of Method A.\n2. The potatoes collected in the silo are then washed, the extraneous matter is removed and their total actual weight is determined, allowing 2 % for absorbed water.\n3. If the total weight of the batches of washed potatoes is different from the sum of the weights obtained by means of Method A, the following correction is applied: the total weight mentioned at point 2 above is multiplied by the net weight obtained by  means of Method A for each batch in turn.\nEach result is divided by the total net weight of the batches as determined by means of Method A.\nPARARTIMA II ANEXO II - BILAG II - ANHANG II -  - ANNEX II - ANNEXE II - ALLEGATO II - BIJLAGE II - ANEXO II\n/* Tables: see OJ */"}
