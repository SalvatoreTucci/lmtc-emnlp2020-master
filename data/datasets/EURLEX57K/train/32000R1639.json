This includes, under point 1.2 of that Annex, the quantity of tobacco (in tonnes) of the moisture content referred to in Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 as regards the premium scheme, production quotas and the specific aid to be granted to producer groups in the raw tobacco sector(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1249/2000(5), covered by the contracts.\n(2) Article 9(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 lays down that, pursuant to Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92, the parties to a cultivation contract may, by means of a written amendment, increase the quantities initially specified in the contract. Under the Community rules currently in force, this may take place well beyond 31 July of the year of harvest.
