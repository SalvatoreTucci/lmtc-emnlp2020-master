However, in the light of the improvement of the epidemiological situation in domestic pigs it is appropriate to amend the procedures established to dispatch pigs for immediate slaughter from the areas where classical swine fever has been detected in feral pigs to slaughterhouses located outside these areas in the same Member State.\n(5) Decision 2003/526/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/526/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
