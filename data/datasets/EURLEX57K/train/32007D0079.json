Those Decisions are to apply until 30 June 2007.\n(3) Decision 2006/415/EC lays down certain protection measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in the territory of a Member State caused by the highly pathogenic A virus of subtype H5, in order to prevent the spread of the avian influenza into the disease free parts of the Community thorough the movement of birds as well as products thereof.\n(4) Hungary has notified the Commission of an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry on its territory and has taken the appropriate measures as provided for in Decision 2006/415/EC, including the establishment of Areas A and B as provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.\n(5) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Hungary, and is satisfied that the borders of Areas A and B established by the competent authority in that Member State are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the outbreak. Areas A and B in Hungary can therefore be confirmed and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend Decision 2006/415/EC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
