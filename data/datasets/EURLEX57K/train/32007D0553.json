As a consequence, these active substances should not be included in the Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(5) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate or dimethipin are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed, and that no authorisations for such products are granted.\n(6) For these active substances for which there is only a short period of advance notice for the withdrawal of plant protection products containing such substances, it is reasonable to provide for a period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks for a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing. In cases where a longer advance notice period is provided, such period can be shortened to expire at the end of the growing season.\n(7) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate or dimethipin according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate and dimethipin shall not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that:\n(a) authorisations for plant protection products containing monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate and dimethipin are withdrawn by 2 February 2008;\n(b) from 6 August 2007 no authorisations for plant protection products containing monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate and dimethipin are granted or renewed under the derogation provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire not later than 2 February 2009.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 August 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L 230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.
