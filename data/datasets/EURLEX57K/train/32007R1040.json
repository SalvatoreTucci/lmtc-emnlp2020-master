In 1930, production received a boost when the area planted was increased and the melon appeared on local markets. Production again increased between 1940 and 1945. Since 1960, exports have permitted further production growth.\nMelon du Quercy now has a confirmed reputation and the range of marks used in itself shows the importance of the link between the product and the area.\nAt the beginning of each marketing year, experts approved by the Certifying Body authorise each grower\u2019s parcels (geographical area and eligible land). Each parcel is entered in the Melon du Quercy cultivation register: commune, section, land register references, area in ares.\nA copy of the information is kept in the grower\u2019s cultivation register, a copy sent to the fruit packing station and another to the \u2018Syndicat Interprofessionnel du Melon du Quercy\u2019.\nFor each lot delivered to the packing station, the name of the grower, the variety and the parcels are identified and recorded. The packing station puts together lots from several growers. Certified lots are separated from non-certified lots on entry into the packing station and are packed, labelled and marketed separately.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe melons are grown from selected varieties. They are harvested when fully ripe and, if possible, before 1 p.m. every day. They are then placed in a single layer on wooden trays or in plastic crates, closely packed but not crushed together.\nAfter harvesting, the melons are placed under cover to protect them from the sun and any bad weather and transported to the packing station the same day. The melons are then checked and approved on the basis of their appearance and sugar content. They are sorted, graded and packed in trays on cellular trays and/or in paper depending on their weight and colour.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nWhat makes Quercy suited to melon growing are its soil and its climate. The alternance of ocean (cool and wet) and Mediterranean (hot and dry) influences typical of its climate produces large temperature ranges on a daily basis, providing the plant with ideal growing conditions (temperature and moisture).\nAnother factor is the limy-clayey soil. The clay is basically of illite and montmorillonite, which retain potassium, thus regulating the plant\u2019s uptake of the mineral. This gives the melon a particular perfume and unique characteristics. The soil retains water well, ensuring that the plant receives a regular supply.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Qualisud\nAddress : 15, avenue de Bayonne \u2014 F-40500 Saint-Sever\nTel. : (33)\u00a0(0)558\u00a006\u00a053\u00a030\nFax : (33)\u00a0(0)562\u00a088\u00a013\u00a091\nE-mail : qualisud@wanadoo.fr\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling:\n\u2014 Product name: Melon du Quercy.\n\u2014 Certified characteristics: Grown in Quercy, harvested fully ripe."}
