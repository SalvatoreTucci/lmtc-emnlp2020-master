Temporary alternatives should therefore be found for sheltering and feeding livestock. The use of land set aside under the arable crop scheme could relieve the situation. However, measures should be taken to ensure that such land is not put to any lucrative use.\n(4) In view of the situation facing farmers, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999, Germany may, in duly justified cases, authorise producers in the regions referred to in the Annex to this Regulation to use set-aside land for sheltering and feeding livestock until 30 April 2002.", "Germany shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that the set-aside land is not put to any lucrative use.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 March 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 April 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 280, 30.10.1999, p. 43.\n(4) OJ L 51, 22.2.2002, p. 14.\nANNEX\nGERMANY\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern\nBrandenburg\nLandkreise:\n- Barnim\n- Dahme-Spreewald\n- Elbe-Elster\n- Havelland\n- M\u0102\u00a4rkisch-Oderland\n- Oberhavel\n- Oder-Spree\n- Potsdam-Mittelmark\n- Prignitz\n- Spree-Nei\u0102\u009fe\n- Uckermark\n- Stadt Frankfurt/Oder"}
