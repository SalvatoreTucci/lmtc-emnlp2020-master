The provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 72/245/EEC.\n(2) According to point 3.2.9 of Annex I to Directive 72/245/EEC components sold as aftermarket equipment and intended for the installation in motor vehicles do not need type-approval if they are not related to immunity related functions. A transition period of four years starting on 3 December 2004, is provided for, during which a technical service has to determine if the component to be placed on the market is immunity related or not and has to issue an attestation as according to the example shown in Annex III C. Member States are required to report any cases of refusals on safety grounds to the European Commission. That provision requires the Commission to decide, based on the practical experience with that requirement and based on the reports submitted by Member States, before the end of the transition period, if that attestation should still be required in addition to the Declaration of Conformity.\n(3) As foreseen in point 3.2.9 of Annex I to Directive 72/245/EEC and having regard to the fact that the European Commission has not received any reports from Member States concerning cases of refusal of attestation, it is now proposed to abolish the involvement of the technical service in the case of components sold as aftermarket equipment and intended for installation in motor vehicles, if they are not related to immunity related functions, and to no longer require the attestation in accordance to the example given in Annex III C, as set out in point 3.2.9 of Annex I.\n(4) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Directive 72/245/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
