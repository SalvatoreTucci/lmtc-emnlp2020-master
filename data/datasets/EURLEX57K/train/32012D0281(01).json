Space is a resource for all countries in the world. Those which do not yet have space activities will have them in the future. Therefore the Union considers that strengthening the security of activities in outer space is an important goal that will contribute to the development and security of States. This objective is part of the Union\u2019s space policy.\n(2) On 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted a European Security Strategy identifying global challenges and threats, and calling for a rule-based international order based on effective multilateralism and well-functioning international institutions.\n(3) The European Security Strategy acknowledges the United Nations Charter as the fundamental framework for international relations and advocates strengthening the United Nations and equipping it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively. The Union works towards a high degree of cooperation in all fields of international relations, in order, inter alia, to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n(4) The Union is committed to the development and implementation of transparency and confidence building measures, as a means to achieve enhanced space security. The Union is also particularly sensitive to the issue of the risks posed by space debris, whatever its origin, which is detrimental to present and future activities.\n(5) On 18 September 2007, in its reply to United Nation General Assembly resolution 61/75 of 6 December 2006, the Union underlined that voluntary \u2018rules of the road\u2019 on outer-space activities endorsing best practices between space actors would serve that objective.\n(6) In its Conclusions of 8-9 December 2008, the Council supported the first draft for an international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities, in which States would participate on a voluntary basis, and which included transparency and confidence-building measures, as a basis for consultations with key third countries that have activities in outer space or have interests in outer space activities, with the aim of reaching a text that is acceptable to the greatest number of countries.\n(7) In the light of consultations with major space-faring nations, the Union has produced a revised version of the draft Code of Conduct, on the basis of which the Council, on 27 September 2010, gave a mandate to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to carry out further and wider consultations,", "main_body": ["To support its proposal for an international Code of Conduct on outer-space activities, the Union shall pursue the following objectives:\n\u2014 consultations with States, active or not yet active on space issues to discuss the proposal and to gather their views,\n\u2014 gathering expert support for the process of developing an international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, the projects to be supported by the Union shall cover the following specific activities:\n(a) outreach activities: promotion of the proposal for an international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities;\n(b) the organisation of up to three multilateral experts\u2019 meetings to discuss the proposal for an international Code of Conduct;.\n(c) the coordination of a consortium of non-governmental experts.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those projects and specific activities are described in more detail in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (\u2018The High Representative\u2019) shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The technical implementation of the projects referred to in Article 2 shall be carried out by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR).

WAMMEN\nANNEX TO THE COUNCIL DECISION IN SUPPORT OF THE UNION PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT ON OUTER-SPACE ACTIVITIES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General Framework and Objectives\nSpace activities are expanding and their importance is crucial. Space is a resource for all countries in the world. Those which do not yet have space activities will have them in the future. Therefore the Union considers that it is necessary to ensure greater security in outer space and believes that a pragmatic and incremental process can assist in achieving this goal. The Union is committed to the development and implementation of transparency and confidence building measures, as a means to achieve enhanced safety and security in outer space. The Union is also particularly sensitive to the issue of the risks posed by space debris which are detrimental to present and future activities.\nOn 18 September 2007, in its reply to the United Nations General Assembly resolution 61/75 of 6 December 2006, the Union underlined that voluntary \u2018rules of the road\u2019 on outer-space activities endorsing best practices between space actors would serve this objective.\nIn its Conclusions of 8-9 December 2008, the Council of the European Union supported the first draft for an international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities, in which States would participate on a voluntary basis, and which included transparency and confidence-building measures, as a basis for consultations with key third countries that have activities in outer space or have interests in outer-space activities, with the aim of reaching a text that is acceptable to the greatest number of countries. In the light of consultations with major space-faring nations, the Union has produced a revised version of the draft Code of Conduct, on the basis of which the Council of the European Union, on 27 September 2010, gave a mandate to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (\u2018The High Representative\u2019) to carry out further and wider consultations.\nTo support the Union proposal for an international Code of Conduct on outer-space activities and to carry out the mandate given to the High Representative, the Union pursues the following objectives:\n\u2014 consultations with as many countries as possible, active or not yet active on space issues to discuss this proposal and gather their views, especially through the organisation of one or several (up to three) multilateral experts meeting(s) to discuss this initiative,\n\u2014 expert support for the process of developing an international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities.\nThe Union\u2019s action is guided by the following principles:\n(a) the recognised importance of building long-term sustainability, predictability and improved security in the outer-space environment;\n(b) the need to build a common understanding and to identify areas of commonality;\n(c) the importance of national and regional buy-in into any future international Code of Conduct for outer-space activities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Projects\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 1: Outreach: Promotion of the proposal for an international Code of Conduct on outer-space
