Up to now, the fact that the pockets have no closing system was merely illustrated in photo 509.\n(3) Moreover, in the reasons given for the classification of the garment in question reference is made to Note 8 of Chapter 62 of the Combined Nomenclature without mentioning which paragraph of that Note has been applied, which might lead to divergent classifications.\n(4) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature it should be made clear that the classification laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 350/93 was not based on the first paragraph of Note 8 and was therefore not determined by the reason that the garment in question has a cut which clearly indicates that it is designed for women.\n(5) Provision should be made that the second paragraph of Note 8 to Chapter 62 was applied and that the garment in question was classified within CN code 6204\u00a063\u00a090 because the cut of the garment in question does not give ample indications as to whether it was intended for men or women and therefore cannot be identified as either men's or boy's garment or as women's or girls' garment.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 350/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Point 8 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 350/93 is amended as follows:\n1. in column 1 (Description) the last sentence is replaced by the following:\n2. in column 3 (Reason) the text is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.
