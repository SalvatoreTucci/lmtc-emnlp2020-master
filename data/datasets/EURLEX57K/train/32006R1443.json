Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Hansenula polymorpha (DSM 15087) for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows. On 7 March 2006 the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) delivered its opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category targeted or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(7) The use of the coccidiostat preparation of semduramicin sodium (AVIAX 5\u00a0%) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1041/2002\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for 10 years of that coccidiostat. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance, as specified in the Annex II, should be authorised for 10 years.\n(8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, belonging to the group \u2018Vitamins, provitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect\u2019 for chickens for fattening, laying hens and turkeys. On 26 May 2005 the Authority has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category targeted or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that vitamin preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without time limit.\n(9) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(5).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex I, are authorised without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostat and other medicinal substances\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised for 10 years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Vitamins, provitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect\u2019, as specified in Annex III, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
