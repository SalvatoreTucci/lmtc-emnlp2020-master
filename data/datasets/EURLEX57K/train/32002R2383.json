Article 20(1) of that Regulation lays down that producer organisations or, where appropriate, associations thereof must submit their members' crop declarations and any amendments thereto to the competent agency of the Member State concerned before 1 January of each marketing year.\n(2) However, in certain olive-growing regions, due in particular to the high number of crop declarations, ongoing restructuring of olive groves or other specific circumstances, the above dates are no longer appropriate for the purpose of controls. Provision should therefore be made for the Member States to be able to extend, within certain limits, the deadlines for the lodging and submission of crop declarations to the competent agency so as to improve the effectiveness of controls in certain regions.\n(3) The management and monitoring of the system of production aid for olive oil requires that the information on new planting provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 be provided on a regular basis. Consequently, the numbers of olive trees for the marketing years after 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 should also be notified to the Commission.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) To allow an extension of the deadline referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 from the current marketing year, this Regulation should apply from 30 November 2002. Provision should therefore be made for its immediate entry into force.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
