That tool uses the actual route length of each flight based upon the most comprehensive air traffic and operational flight information currently available and addresses the fuel consumed during all aspects of a particular flight including that at the departure gate, during taxiing operations, during landing, take-off and cruise as well as during air traffic management actions. The tool uses statistically robust fuel consumption coefficients for the most important aircraft types as well as a more generic approach for other aircraft which determines fuel consumption coefficients as a function of the aircraft\u2019s maximum take-off mass which result in acceptable levels of uncertainty.\n(6) This tool meets the requirements of the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC in respect of the approach based on individual flights, actual route length and statistically sound fuel consumption relationships. It is therefore appropriate that this tool be available and approved for use by the relevant aircraft operators in order to allow them to fulfil their monitoring and reporting obligations in an administratively less burdensome manner.\n(7) Due to reasons beyond its control, an aircraft operator may be unable to monitor the actual fuel consumed for a particular flight. In such circumstances, and in the absence of other means to determine the actual fuel consumption, it is appropriate that the fuel consumption estimation tool utilised by small emitters should also be available to other aircraft operators to determine estimates of fuel consumption for specific flights where actual fuel consumption data is missing.\n(8) Part 6 of Annex XIV to Decision 2007/589/EC requires an aircraft operator which employs a fuel consumption estimation tool to include in its monitoring plan evidence that the conditions for small emitters are satisfied, as well as providing a confirmation and description of the tool used.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["The fuel consumption estimation tool developed and offered for use by the European organisation for air safety navigation (Eurocontrol)\u00a0(3) is approved for use by:\n1.
