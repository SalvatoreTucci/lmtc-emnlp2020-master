The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission and to deliver an opinion on a health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from ELVIR S.A.S., submitted on 5 June 2008 pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of a milk product, rich in fibre and protein, on the reduction of the sense of hunger (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-396)\u00a0(2). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018This product reduces the sense of hunger\u2019.\n(6) On 19 December 2008, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority. It followed from the opinion and subsequent clarification from the Authority that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the milk product, rich in fibre and protein, and a reduction of the sense of hunger that is nutritionally or physiologically beneficial in terms of effect on food energy intake. Considering this, the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health, at its meeting of 27 April 2009 concluded that the health claim should be subject to further consideration and the Commission submitted on 24 June 2009 a request to the Authority for further advice on a number of elements in relation to the submitted application.\n(7) On 22 July 2009 the Commission and the Member States received the response from the Authority where it is clarified that the effect observed could not be attributed solely to the food tested because of the lack of information on the dietary conditions of the studies. Accordingly, that health claim can not be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and it should not be authorised.\n(8) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission, pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(9) Health claims referred to in Article 13(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 are subject to the transition measures laid down in Article 28(6) of that Regulation only if they comply with the conditions therein mentioned, among which that the applications for health claims not subject of evaluation and authorisation in a Member State have to be made before 19 January 2008. As the application for the health claim subject to the present Regulation was not made before that date it can not benefit from the transition period foreseen in Article 28(6) of that Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["The health claim set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall not be included in the Community list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 894, 1-9.\nANNEX\nRejected health claim\nApplication \u2014 relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Milk product, rich in fibre and protein This product reduces the sense of hunger Q-2008-396"}
