In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) In accordance with the provisions of Directive 68/193/EEC, Member States are obliged to compile a catalogue of the varieties accepted for certification and inspection of standard propagation material in their territory.\n(3) The acceptance of varieties is subject to Community conditions which should be enforced by means of official inspections and in particular by crop inspections.\n(4) The inspections should cover a sufficient number of characteristics to enable the varieties to be described.\n(5) The minimum characteristics which have to undergo inspection should be determined at Community level.\n(6) Moreover, the minimum conditions for carrying out the inspections should be laid down.\n(7) These characteristics and minimum conditions for inspection should be laid down in the light of the present state of scientific and technical knowledge.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry.\n(9) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the directives set out in Annex III, part B,", "main_body": ["Member States shall provide that official inspections carried out for the acceptance of vine varieties shall cover at least the characteristics listed in Annex I.\nThey shall ensure that the minimum conditions listed in Annex II are fulfilled at the time of the inspections.", "Directive 72/169/EEC, as amended by the Directive listed in Annex III, part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex III, part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directives shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex IV.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 93, 17.4.1968, p. 15.\n(2) OJ L 165, 3.7.2003, p. 23.\n(3) OJ L 103, 2.5.1972, p. 25.\n(4) See Annex III, part A.\nANNEX I\nPART A MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS CONSIDERED IN THE EXAMINATION FOR DISTINCTIVENESS, STABILITY AND HOMOGENEITY\n1.
