A special measure was necessary to prevent continuing reinfection of neighbouring Member States from the Kaliningrad region and aiming to eliminate the disease also from its territory.\n(5) Given the relative size of the territory of the Kaliningrad region, it is more appropriate and cost-efficient to assist in the efforts towards the elimination of rabies in that region than to put in place vaccination buffer zones in the territories of the neighbouring Member States which would have to be maintained indefinitely.\n(6) As a result of the implementation of the above mentioned plan, in 2013 no rabies cases have been detected in the Kaliningrad region as well as in the areas of Lithuania and Poland that are adjacent thereto.\n(7) To ensure rabies is eliminated from a territory, it is necessary to continue without interruption the implementation of oral vaccination activities twice-yearly for at least 2 years following the detection of the last case of the disease.\n(8) The Union-financed 36-month plan currently in place expires on the 31 May 2014.\n(9) To safeguard the results achieved through Union co-financing over the past years and to ensure the achievement of the objective of eliminating rabies from the Kaliningrad Region and the risk of its reintroduction to neighbouring Union territory, it is necessary that the financial support to the rabies elimination activities in the Kaliningrad Region is extended for an additional 24-month period.\n(10) On 13 January 2013, Russia has submitted to the Commission a plan for the elimination of rabies from the Kaliningrad region for the period between June 2014 and May 2016 and that plan was found to be acceptable as regards the objective of protecting the Union against rabies. The actions foreseen in that plan are essential for the protection of Union interest and it is therefore appropriate that certain measures receive Union co-financing. A Union financial contribution should therefore be granted in 2014 for the implementation of that plan.\n(11) In accordance with Article 84 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and with Article 94 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing Decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.\n(12) In addition, Commission Decision 2011/C 64/05 will become obsolete and should be repealed.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rabies elimination plan in the Kaliningrad Region (the plan) submitted by Russia is hereby approved for the period between 1 June 2014 and 31 May 2016.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The action under this Decision shall cover the following measures which constitute part of the foreseen activities under the plan referred to in paragraph 1:\n\u2014 purchase of the vaccine baits for the oral immunisation of wild carnivores,\n\u2014 distribution in the territory of the Kaliningrad region of the vaccine baits referred in the preceding point.", "The maximum contribution of the Union is set at EUR 1\u00a0100\u00a0000 to be financed from budget line 17\u00a004\u00a004 of the General Budget of the Union for the financial year 2014.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The award of an individual grant to the State Veterinary Agency of the Kaliningrad region of Russia \u2018Regional Centre for Combating Animal Disease\u2019 (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u201e\u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0435 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445\u201c) is authorised.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures referred to in Article 1(2) may be financed up to 100\u00a0% of the corresponding eligible costs, provided that part of the total costs of the action is borne by the State Veterinary Agency of the Kaliningrad region of Russia \u2018Regional Centre for Combating Animal Disease\u2019 (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u201e\u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0435 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445\u201c) or by contributions other than the Union contribution.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The maximum amount to be reimbursed for the measures referred to in Article 1(2) shall not exceed on average EUR 0,95 per vaccine bait purchased and distributed.", "The detailed conditions for the the technical implementation and the financing shall be set out in a grant agreement to be signed between the Commission and the beneficiary.", "This Decision constitutes a financing decision in the meaning of Article 84 of the Financial Regulation.", "Commission Decision 2011/C 64/05 is hereby repealed with effect from the 31 December 2014."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 30.7.2009, p. 85.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 64, 1.3.2011, p. 7."}
