Transitional measures should therefore be laid down for stocks held on 31 March 2006. To avoid any discrimination between operators, these measures should apply to all Member States. Provision should be made for the notification of the stocks benefiting from these measures.\n(3) The reference to the ceilings set out in point D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be replaced by a reference to the ceilings set out in Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 118/2005 of 26 January 2005 modifying Annex VIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and establishing budgetary ceilings for partial or optional implementation of the Single Payment Scheme and annual financial envelopes for Single Area Payment Scheme provided for in that Regulation\u00a0(4).\n(4) A number of improvements should be made to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 in order to obtain a useful overview of energy consumption.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Joint Management Committee for Cereals and Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. the third subparagraph of Article 9 is replaced by the following:\n2.
