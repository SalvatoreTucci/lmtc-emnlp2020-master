The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide the results of the quantitative indicators for each Member State, calculated on the basis of data provided. Member States shall interpret and comment them, in the light of their collection methodology.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timeline\n\u2014 Every year, the Commission (Eurostat) shall supply the Member States by the end of October with draft documents for quality reports, partially pre-filled with most quantitative indicators and other information available to the Commission (Eurostat).\n\u2014 Every year, Member States shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) by 30 November with the completed quality reports.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quality criteria\nThe following quality criteria have been identified as relevant: timeliness and coverage of data, methodological soundness, stability, plausibility, consistency and accuracy. The component \u2018accuracy\u2019, though conceptually relevant, will be treated separately, as a side-component, as it is related to quality on the input side.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timeliness and coverage of data transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat)\nThis component refers to adherence to the deadlines for data transmission as well as availability of data according to the reference periods and geographical, item and activity breakdowns.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Methodological soundness\nMethodological soundness refers to compliance with internationally accepted standards, guidelines and good practices.\nThis component will include a limited number of questions, varying from year to year, in the area of methodology, and will focus on compliance with internationally agreed standards. Member States will also describe the major methodological changes that have taken place during the reference period and how they affect the data quality.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stability\nStability refers to the closeness of the initial estimated value to the final value.\nThis consists of examining the size of the revisions, their direction and the conformity between the trends derived from the initial and final estimates.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plausibility\nPlausibility refers to the absence of unexplained changes.\nMember States shall evaluate their internal control procedures (strengths and weaknesses) and describe further plans for improvement.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency\nConsistency analyses coherence both within the dataset delivered (internal consistency) and with other relevant datasets of a similar nature (external consistency).\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accuracy\nAccuracy refers to the closeness of the (final) estimate to the true population value.\nIt will contain a descriptive analysis of the main challenges to improve data coverage, based on a set of parameters. This criterion will be treated as an additional quality component and will not be taken into account for the overall quality assessment."}
