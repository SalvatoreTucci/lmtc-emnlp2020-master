PRODUCT\nThe product concerned by the possible circumvention is certain ring binder mechanisms, normally declared under CN code ex 8305 10 00 (\"the product concerned\") originating in China. This CN code is given for information only.\nThe product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Thailand (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned originating in China.\nB. EXISTING MEASURES\nThe measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97(3) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000(4).\nC. GROUNDS\nThe Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Thailand of certain ring binder mechanisms.\nThe evidence available is as follows:\nA significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from China and Thailand to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China. Imports of the product under investigation have increased substantially, whereas imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China have decreased following the imposition of measures, and there appears to be insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment via Thailand of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China.\nFurthermore, the evidence points to the fact that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China are being undermined in terms of quantity. Significant volumes of imports of the product concerned from Thailand appear to have replaced imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China.\nFinally, the Commission has sufficient prima facie evidence at its disposal that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for certain ring binder mechanisms originating in China.\nShould circumvention practices via Thailand covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation other than transhipment be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.\nD. PROCEDURE\nIn the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Thailand, whether declared as originating in Thailand or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.\na) Questionnaires\nIn order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Thailand, the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in China, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures and to the authorities of China and Thailand. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.\nIn any event all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.\nThe authorities of China and Thailand will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.\nb) Collection of information and holding of hearings\nAll interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\nc) Exemption from registration of imports or measures\nIn accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted to producers of the product concerned in Thailand that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Article 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.\nE. REGISTRATION\nPursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of the registration of such imports consigned from Thailand.\nF. TIME LIMITS\nIn the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n- interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation;\n- producers in Thailand may request exemption from registration of imports or measures;\n- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nAttention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.\nG. NON-COOPERATION\nIn cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to the party than if it had cooperated,", "main_body": ["An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of certain ring binder mechanisms, falling within CN code ex 8305 10 00 (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 12 and 8305 10 00 22 ), consigned from Thailand, whether originating in Thailand or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000.\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover.
