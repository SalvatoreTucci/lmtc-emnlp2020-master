(7)OJ No L 260, 22.10.1968, p. 1.\nWhereas the restrictions on freedom to provide services in respect of intermediaries in the employment of one or more industrial or commercial undertakings should be abolished under this Directive ; whereas it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between activities of employed intermediaries and those of self-employed agents because the legal distinction between the two is not the same in all six countries ; whereas the activities of employed intermediaries fall within the same economic category as those of self-employed agents and it would be neither convenient nor useful to split up the liberalisation of this very special form of provision of services into a series of measures of partial liberalisation, effected as and when the activities of the employers are liberalised;\nWhereas the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment provides that restrictions on the right to join professional or trade organisations must be abolished where the professional activities of the person concerned necessarily involve the exercise of that right;\nWhereas the position of paid employees accompanying the person providing services or acting on his behalf will be governed by the provisions laid down in pursuance of Articles 48 and 49 of the Treaty;\nWhereas separate Directives, applicable to all activities of self-employed persons, concerning provisions relating to the movement and residence of beneficiaries, and where necessary Directives on the co-ordination of the safeguards required by Member States of companies or firms for the protection of the interests of members and of others, have been or will be adopted;\nWhereas, moreover, in some Member States the wholesale coal trade is governed by rules relating to the taking up of that trade ; whereas, therefore, certain transitional measures, the purpose of which is to make it easier for nationals of other Member States to take up and pursue activities in wholesale trade, are the subject of a separate Directive;", "main_body": ["Member States shall abolish, in respect of the natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services (hereinafter called \"beneficiaries\"), the restrictions referred to in Title III of those General Programmes affecting the right to take up and pursue the activities specified in Articles 2 and 3 of this Directive.", "1.

In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, membership of the Chambre de commerce or of the Chambre des m\u00e9tiers shall not give beneficiaries the right to take part in the election of the administrative organs of those Chambers.", "No Member State shall grant to any of its nationals who go to another Member State for the purpose of pursuing any activity referred to in Article 2 or in Article 3 any aid liable to distort the conditions of establishment.", "1. Where a host Member State requires of its nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 2 or in Article 3 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the \"judicial record\" or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes, showing that these requirements have been met.\nNevertheless, in the case of intermediaries who go from door to door seeking orders, facts other than those which may be given in the document referred to in the preceding subparagraph may also be taken into consideration where such facts have been officially certified and clearly show that the person concerned does not satisfy all the conditions as to good repute which persons wishing to pursue that activity are required to satisfy.
