The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by Ireland in respect of the period 1\u00a0January to 31\u00a0December 2007, the average ageing period for Irish whiskey in 2007 was five years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway.
