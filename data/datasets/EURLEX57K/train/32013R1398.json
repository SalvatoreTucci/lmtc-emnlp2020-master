These discrepancies show the UK fishing vessels have deployed a level of effort above that available to this fleet in 2012 as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1415/2004 and adapted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. The evidence gathered in the course of the investigation and enquiries allows the Commission to establish that this Member State has exceeded its 2012 maximum fishing effort for scallops by 451\u00a0641\u00a0kW days and for edible and spider crab by 38\u00a0462\u00a0kW days.\n(4) According to Article 106(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, when the Commission has established that a Member State has exceeded the fishing effort which has been allocated to it, the Commission shall operate deductions from future fishing effort allocations to that Member State.\n(5) Article 106(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 provides that deductions from fishing effort shall be operated in the following year or years by applying certain multiplying factors set out in that paragraph.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to operate deductions from the fishing effort allocated to the United Kingdom for scallops and for edible crab and spider crab in ICES area VII in the year 2013.", "main_body": ["The maximum annual fishing effort fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1415/2004 for scallops and for edible crab and spider crab in ICES area VII is reduced in 2013 for the United Kingdom as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 258, 5.8.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\nANNEX\nSpecies Initial maximum fishing effort 2012\u00a0(1) Adapted maximum fishing effort 2012 Established utilised fishing effort 2012 Difference maximum effort-utilised effort (excess) Multiplying factor of Article 106(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 Deduction 2013\nScallops in ICES area VII 3\u00a0315\u00a0619 3\u00a0550\u00a0619 4\u00a0002\u00a0260 451\u00a0641 541\u00a0969 541\u00a0969\nEdible and spider crab in ICES area VII 543\u00a0366 543\u00a0366 581\u00a0828 38\u00a0462 42\u00a0308 42\u00a0308\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1415/2004, OJ L 258, 5.8.2004, p. 1."}
