Article 1 (b) of Decision 97/428/EC also authorises aid to be granted for up to five years as an income support where there is a change of production.\n(6) Finland has requested the Commission to extend the authorisation of this aid for investments in primary production to 31 December 2003.\n(7) The data sent by Finland pursuant to Article 3 of Decision 97/428/EC indicates that this aid for investments in primary production helps, through structural improvements, to maintain and improve existing production patterns; the request to extend the duration of this aid should be accepted for this reason.\n(8) In Article 2 of Decision 97/428/EC, the Commission has authorised certain aid measures for an indefinite duration in accordance with Article 88 of the Treaty.\n(9) In its notification, Finland has indicated that it intends to discontinue some of these measures, but to maintain the aid for the development of quality systems referred to in Article 2(d) of Decision 97/428/EC and the additional aids referred to in Article 2(e) of that Decision.\n(10) There is no reason to review the previous assessment of the Commission that these aids can be considered compatible with the common market. These aids therefore continue to be authorised in accordance with Decision 97/428/EC.\n(11) In its notification of 25 October 1999, Finland also asked the Commission to approve, under Article 141 of the Act of Accession, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003, certain direct payments to producers in the animal husbandry, milk and horticultural production sectors.\n(12) In accordance with Article 141 of the Act of Accession, the Commission may authorise Finland to grant national aids to producers so as to facilitate their full integration into the common agricultural policy where there are serious difficulties resulting from accession which remain after full utilisation of the provisions of Articles 138, 139, 140 and 142 and of the other measures resulting from the rules existing in the Community.\n(13) In accordance with Article 137(3) of the Act of Accession, the period during which aid under Articles 138, 139 and 140 may be granted expired on 31 December 1999.\n(14) Article 142 of the Act of Accession does not apply to the regions included in the national aid programme notified to the Commission on 25 October 1999.\n(15) Due to climatic conditions, as well as to the small size of the farms and the higher levels of fixed costs, the profitability of agricultural production in Southern Finland is very low.\n(16) The data sent by Finland shows that a sudden reduction in support due to the expiry of aid under Articles 138, 139 and 140 of the Act of Accession would cause severe problems in that reducing farmers' income significantly would endanger the continuation of agricultural production in Southern Finland.\n(17) Although some improvement was achieved in recent years, further structural adjustment of the farm sector in Southern Finland is still needed in order to ensure the effective integration of Finnish agriculture into the common agricultural policy.\n(18) The Commission took the view in Decision 97/428/EC that aid under Article 141 of the Act of Accession should address structural inefficiencies that could be changed in order to facilitate the full integration of producers into the common agricultural policy.\n(19) In the light of experience, however, it appears that transitional and degressive direct income payments may be seen as a necessary complement to a structural adjustment policy, providing that such payments are essentially intended to accompany structural adaptation, do not hinder the realisation of the necessary structural changes and are limited to the period of time necessary.\n(20) However, given the length of time necessary to achieve long-term structural change, it is appropriate to set the duration of the aid authorised by the present Decision to the period expiring on 31 December 2003.\n(21) The total amount of production eligible for support should be limited to that which was previously eligible for aid pursuant to Article 138 of the Act of Accession. The production in question is less than 1 % of Community production in all the relevant sectors, and is not therefore expected to have a serious effect on the Community markets.\n(22) Finland should be required to provide a detailed report on all measures and sectors concerned before 30 June 2003, including an assessment of the results of these measures in solving the serious difficulties and in assisting the full integration of Finnish farmers in the common agricultural policy.\n(23) As regards the livestock sector, for reasons of administrative efficiency, Finland has asked to apply an aid per livestock unit in certain cases rather than aid per kilogramme or per animal,", "main_body": ["The Commission authorises Finland to continue to grant the aid referred to in Article 1(a) of Decision 97/428/EC until 31 December 2003.", "1.
