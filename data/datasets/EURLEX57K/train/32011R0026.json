Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Vitamin E was authorised without time limit as a feed additive for use in all animal species by Directive 70/524/EEC as part of the group \u2018Vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect\u2019. That additive was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of vitamin E as a feed additive for all animal species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019. The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 25 May 2010 that, under the proposed conditions of use, vitamin E does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment\u00a0(3). It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of vitamin E shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since the modifications on the conditions of the authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the premixtures and compound feed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 are authorised as additives in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Feed containing vitamin E labelled in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC or Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 may continue to be placed on the market and used until stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 January 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(6):1635 (Summary).\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Additive Chemical formula, description, methods of analysis Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nNutritional additives: Vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect\nActive substance\nall-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate: C31H52O3\nPurity criteria: all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate > 93\u00a0%\nMethods of analysis\n1.
