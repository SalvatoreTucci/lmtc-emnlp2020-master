The term \"patudo\" in the Spanish language version of that Regulation published in the Official Journal of the European Communities is wrong and must be replaced by \"at\u0102\u015fn blanco\". Since this mistake was not immediately obvious to the economic operators concerned, the Regulation in question should be corrected.\n(2) Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 142/98 of 21 January 1998 laying down detailed rules for granting the compensatory allowances for tuna intended for the processing industry(4), applications for payment of the allowance must be submitted by the producers' organisations concerned to the competent authorities not later than 45 days after the entry into force of the Regulation concerned, i.e. 6 August 1999. However, owing to the inconspicuous mistake in the Spanish language version of Regulation (EC) No 1282/1999, some operators may not have submitted applications for payment of the allowance. The full period of 45 days from the entry into force of this Regulation should accordingly be allowed to run in cases where the producers' organisations concerned have not yet submitted applications for payment of the allowance.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["Concerns the Spanish language version only.", "In cases where the producers' organisations concerned have not yet submitted applications for payment of the allowance, the period of 45 days provided for in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 142/98 shall only commence running from the entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 November 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 388, 31.12.1992, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 350, 31.12.1994, p. 15.\n(3) OJ L 153, 19.6.1999, p. 40.\n(4) OJ L 17, 22.1.1998, p. 8."}
