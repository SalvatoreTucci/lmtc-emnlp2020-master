The objections were deemed admissible under points (a), (b), (c) and (d) the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) thereof.\n(3) By letter dated 14 March 2011, the Commission asked the Parties concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.\n(4) An agreement was reached between Thailand and France. Given that no agreement was reached within the designated timeframe of six months between Thailand and the Netherlands, and that only a partial agreement was reached within such timeframe between Thailand and Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom, the Commission should adopt a decision.\n(5) With regard to the definition of the geographical area for production, processing and packaging, France pointed out an inconsistency between the Single Document and the national legislation of Thailand that allowed processing and packaging outside the geographical area of production. Thailand recognised the inconsistency and amended its national registration as well as the Single Document to clarify that there is only one single geographical area of production, processing and packaging.\n(6)\n(7)\n(8) With regard to the packaging requirement to take place in the area of production, Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom objected as being not adequately justified or unnecessarily restricting. France and Thailand found an agreement after amendment of the Single Document by Thailand in order to explain better the reasons why packaging has to take place in the geographical area. No agreement on this issue was reached between Thailand and Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

It is grown from Khao Dawk Mali (KDML 105) and RD 15 varieties and is a light-sensitive paddy rice. It can be brown or white (milled rice).\nPhysical characteristics\nRice hull: straw yellow colour.\nLong, slim, transparent and shiny.\nSilky smooth.\nGood smell like pandanus leaf.\nPhysical characteristics Brown rice White rice\nLength (mm) > 7,0 > 7,0\nShape (Length/Width) > 3,2 > 3,2\nColour Yellowish brown White\nChemical characteristics\nMoisture content Not more than 14\u00a0%\nContaminants Not more than 0,2\u00a0%\nYellow grains Not more than 0,2\u00a0%\nMixture of other rice varieties Not more than 8\u00a0%\nAmylose (%) 14-16\u00a0%\nAlkaline test 6-7\nChemical characteristics (mean value (\u00b1 5\u00a0%)) Brown rice White rice\nProtein (%) 7,6 5,4\nVitamin B1 (mg/100g) 0,34 0,18\nVitamin B2 (mg/100g) 0,27 0,07\nVitamin B3 (mg/100g) 5,0 1,2\nIron (ppm) 28 16\nOther characteristics\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cooking characteristics (mean values)\nCooking time 15-20 min.\nRice:water ratio for cooking 1:1 or 1:1,25\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aroma and flavour\nThe cooked rice smells liked pandanus leaf and tastes velvety, spongy and slightly sweet. It has a slight hint of the added condiments when cooked with other ingredients. Newly harvested KDML 105 and RD 15 rice grains have a creamy smooth texture when boiled.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nThe rice seeds used to produce Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai have to be grown in Thung Kula Rong-Hai.\nThe seeds must be Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) and Kor Khor or RD 15 breeds obtained from the Rice Department or rice-grain producers, i.e. farmers\u2019 organisations or private organisations certified by the Rice Department based on the standards for rice grain production.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area\nThe whole of the production cycle must take place in the defined geographical area to ensure that it is conducted entirely under the geomorphological conditions specific to that area. Needless to say, given the growing conditions the entire biological cycle up to harvesting is carried out in the same place, i.e. where the rice was originally sown. Harvesting is governed by special rules which cover the dates, phonological stages and grain moisture to guarantee the hygiene and safety of the product and complete traceability of the rice to the region of origin and even, in many cases, to the original farmer. The processing shall take place in Roi Et, Surin, Sisaket, Mahasarakham, and Yasothon Provinces, which are the five provinces of the Thung Kula Rong-Hai area.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nThe packaging shall take place in Roi Et, Surin, Sisaket, Mahasarakham, and Yasothon Provinces, which are the five provinces of the Thung Kula Rong-Hai area. This is to give consumers an effective guarantee of the origin, the quality of the rice and in order to ensure the retention of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (0,1-0,2 micrograms at the growing field), unique to Khao Hom Mali grown within the identified geographical area. The repackaging is not allowed in order to minimise possible dilution in concentration, which would undermine its distinctive aroma and to prevent any possible contamination or alteration of the product.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nPackages must be labelled with the weight, the date of packing, the name of the mill or the name of the cooperative.\nEach package must bear the words \u2018\u2019 and/or \u2018Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai\u2019.\nThe Thai GI logo plus the EU logo (after European registration) are also mandatory.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area where all the operations take place (sowing, cultivation, harvesting, milling, packaging and labelling) is Roi-et, Mahasarakam, Surin, Yasothon and Srisaket.\nDue to the specific weather and soil conditions required the cultivation area lies in:\n\u2014 Roi Et province consisting of 986\u00a0807 rai (6,25 rai = 1 hectare) of land in tambons within the Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain in Kaset Wisai, Suwannabhumi, Pratumrat and Phonsai districts and Nong Hee subdistrict.\n\u2014 Surin province consisting of 575\u00a0993 rai of land in tambons within the Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain in Ta Tum and Chumpol Buri districts.\n\u2014 Sisaket province consisting of 287\u00a0000 rai of land in tambons within the Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain in Rasi Salai district and Silalat subdistrict.\n\u2014 Maharasakham province consisting of 193\u00a0890 rai of land in tambons within the Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain in Phayakaphum Pisai district.\n\u2014 Yasothon province consisting of 64\u00a0000 rai of land in tambons within the Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain in Maha Chanachai and Kor Wang districts.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe Thung Kula Rong-Hai Plain is a large plain in north-east Thailand, extending across five provinces, namely Roi Et, Mahasarakam, Surin, Yasothon and Srisaket. It covers a total of 2\u00a0107\u00a0690 rai and was formerly named Thung Mah Long or Thung Pu Pa Lan.\nNatural and human factors play an integral role in production and, in particular, cultivation of Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai rice. Human knowledge also plays a key role in production of this rice, from selecting quality seeds to following suitable cultivation methods, constructing bunds and segmenting the paddy field into sections to retain sufficient water for the rice to grow. Water is drained from the fields about 10 days before harvest, when the mature rice is cut and dried for 2 or 3 days to reduce moisture. These are the natural factors and local knowledge which determine the quality of Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nKhao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai refers to paddy, brown and milled rice processed from the light-sensitive rice varieties Khao Dawk Mali 105 and Kor Khor or RD 15, grown in the rainy season in Thailand in the Thung Kula Rong-Hai area and exuding a natural aroma.\nThe only rice eligible is the abovementioned variety from the defined geographical area, since only these conditions produce rice with low amylose content (14-16\u00a0%) and with an amylopectin content of 86-84\u00a0%. This allows the rice to absorb a low proportion of the water in which it is cooked and release flavours. These outstanding characteristics are possible only under the unique geomorphological conditions in the north-eastern part of Thailand (nature of the soil, quality of the water used, number of hours of sunshine, narrow range of temperatures, cool dry weather in the harvesting season, etc.).\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\n\u2018Thung Kula Rong-Hai\u2019 is derived from the legendary \u2018Kula merchants\u2019. According to the legend, because of the dry weather in the dry season, a group of native people called Kula who were merchants journeyed across this large plain to sell their wares. They travelled until they were exhausted, but were still unable to reach the other side. They then felt like crying (\u2018Rong-Hai\u2019 in Thai), hence the name \u2018Thung Kula Rong-Hai\u2019 (\u2018plain of the crying Kula\u2019).\nCultivation of Hom Mali rice in Thung Kula Rong-Hai began after the government improved the Hom Mali rice variety and certified it in 1959 naming it \u2018Khao Dawk Mali 105\u2019. Cultivation became more widespread in 1979 when the rice seeds exchange project called for planting glutinous rice in the Thung Kula Rong-Hai area. Farmers were advised to change the new rice seeds every three years to maintain seed purity.\nBecause the paddy depended on rain water, cultivation could be carried out only once a year. Harvesting takes place in the cold season when the weather is cold and dry (after the end of the rainy season). According to local knowledge, a flooded paddy field needs to be drained about 10 to 15 days before harvesting to obtain rice of good physical quality, with long, slim, clear and sturdy grains. The cooked rice should be soft and fragrant. This practice, coupled with good agricultural practice (GAP), gives Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong-Hai its unique quality, distinctive from Hom Mali rice grown in other areas and recognised by traders and consumers both in the producing country itself and internationally.\nThe slightly saline soil in northern Thailand, the coolness and dryness of the area, the specific rice varieties (KDML 105 and RD 15) used, the climate and the soil nutrients cause the paddy to become stressed and to produce the aromatic substance 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), the same substance which produces the fragrance in pandanus leaves. This is the miracle gift from the nature on Khao Hom Mali Thung Kula Rong Hai.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p. 1)."}
