It has been judged appropriate to affix the regional logo next to the designation logo on the heel of the product where the whole production cycle takes place within the stated region.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

When it is marketed for human consumption it is cylindrical in shape with flat sides and the diameter of its flat sides is between 25 and 35 cm. Its weight varies from 20 to 35 kg, according to the size of the cheese wheel. The crust is fine, and ivory or natural straw in colour, and is sometimes covered with special protective covers. The rind has a compact or slightly open structure; when cut it is of a colour varying between white and a more or less intense straw colour. The taste is aromatic and slightly spicy for the table cheese, and spicy, intense and pleasant at the advanced stage of maturing for the grating cheese. \u2018Pecorino Romano\u2019 has a characteristic aroma. Fat content of the dry matter: not less than 36\u00a0%.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nThe whole territory of the regions of Sardinia, Lazio and the province of Grosseto.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nEach stage in the production process is monitored, with all incoming and outgoing products recorded at each production stage. This, along with the compilation of specific registers managed by the inspection body for breeders, cheesemakers, cheese maturers and packagers and timely notification to the inspection body of the quantities produced, ensures product traceability. All natural or legal persons entered on these registers will be inspected by the inspection body in accordance with the specification and the inspection plan.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk may undergo thermisation treatment and possibly be inoculated with native milk ferment cultures, to which are sometimes added strains from the production area. It must be soured at a temperature of between 38 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C with the lamb\u2019s rennet crust coming exclusively from animals bred in the same production area. The soured milk must be cooked at a temperature which fluctuates between 45 and 48\u00a0\u00b0C. Salting can involve dry-salting and/or wet-salting. Maturing takes at least 5 months for table cheese and 8 months for grating cheese. The cheese may be covered with a neutral or black food protective cover. Production takes place between October and July.\nThe milk production, production and maturing of \u2018Pecorino Romano\u2019 cheese and the marking operations must be carried out on the territory of the area stated in paragraph 4(3).\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nIn terms of natural factors, the production area must exhibit specific climatic and soil conditions. In terms of human factors, it is important to stress the presence and historical distribution of the cheese across consumer markets.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nThe inspection body is in keeping with standard EN 45011.\nName: OCPA\nAddress: Zona industriale Macomer c/o Consorzio Latte, 08015 Macomer NU, ITALIA\nTel. +39\u00a00785742196\nFax +39\u00a00785742197\nE-mail: ocpa.cert@tiscali.it\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\n\u2018Pecorino Romano\u2019 cheese wheels are marked at source across the heel by means of the matrix designed for this purpose. This prints on the cheese wheel the \u2018Pecorino Romano\u2019 designation and its logo, the initials of the province of origin, the code of the cheesemaker producer and the month and year of production.\nThe designation logo consists of a diamond-shape formed with a continuous or stippled line and rounded angles which contains the stylised head of a sheep above the inscription of the \u2018Pecorino Romano\u2019 designation.\nThe use of an additional regional logo is authorised. It is affixed beside the designation logo on labels applied to the flat side of the cheese wheel where the whole production cycle takes place in the region concerned."}
