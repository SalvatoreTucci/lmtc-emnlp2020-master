According to Article 12(d) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, the isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 7 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.\n(2) For certain Community producers of isoglucose, exports from the Community represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Community. Exports of isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end, it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota isoglucose exports so that the Community producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets.\n(3) Until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year, i.e. 30 September 2008, it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit at 40\u00a0000 tonnes, in dry matter, for out-of-quota isoglucose exports would correspond to the market demand.\n(4) With a view to ensuring orderly management, preventing speculation and providing for effective controls, detailed rules should be laid down for submitting licence applications. Such rules should make use of the procedures laid down by existing legislation, with suitable adaptations to reflect the specific needs of this sector.\n(5) In order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the eventual re-import or re-introduction into the Community of the isoglucose concerned, certain countries of the Western Balkans should be excluded from the eligible destinations for out-of-quota isoglucose exports. However, those countries of this region whose authorities have to issue an export certificate for the confirmation of the origin of the sugar or isoglucose products to be exported to the Community should be exempted from this exclusion as the risk of fraud is more limited.\n(6) To assure coherence with the provisions relevant to exports in the sugar sector as laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 900/2007 of 27 July 2007 on a standing invitation to tender to determine refunds on exports of white sugar until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year\u00a0(2) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1060/2007 of 14 September 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale for export of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden\u00a0(3) exports of out-of-quota isoglucose should not be permitted to certain close destinations as well.\n(7) In order to reduce the risk of re-importation into the Community and, more specifically, to ensure that the specific rules for returned goods referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4) and in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5) are respected, Member States should be required to take all the necessary control measures.\n(8) In addition to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector,\u00a0(6) further implementing provisions should be established for the administration of the quantitative limit to be fixed by this Regulation, in particular regarding the conditions for applying for export licences.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Fixing the quantitative limit for out-of-quota isoglucose exports\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until
