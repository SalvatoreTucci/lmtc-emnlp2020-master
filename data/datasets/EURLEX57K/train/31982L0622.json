(2) OJ No L 335, 5.12.1973, p. 1. (3) OJ No L 236, 27.8.1976, p. 26.\nANNEX\n2.4.3. Repeatability\nAbility of a weighing machine to provide measurement results that agree with each other for the same load deposited several times on the load receptor under virtually identical conditions, not taking account of systematic errors.\n10.4.5. Quality of printing of results\nPrinting of the results must be clear and virtually indelible under normal conditions of use.\n10.4.7. Names or symbols of the units of measurement\nThe weighing results provided by graduated machines must contain the names or symbols of the units of measurement listed in Chapter I of the Annex to Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979.\nIf printing takes place, the name or symbol of the corresponding unit of measurement must be printed by the machine on the document intended for the contracting parties. The name or symbol of the unit of measurement must be indicated either after each weighing result or at the head of the corresponding printed column.\n10.4.8. Limit of indication of results\n10.4.8.1. Machines with continuous indication\nStops must limit the movement of the indicating element, while allowing it to pass below zero and above the range of self-indication over a non-graduated space of not less than four scale intervals and not more than nine scale intervals.\nThis requirement does not apply to machines fitted with a circular scale dial incorporating a multiple-revolution pointer.\n10.4.8.2. Machines with discontinuous indication\nIndication must be rendered impossible above the maximum capacity plus nine scale intervals.\n10.4.9. Limit of printing of the results\nPrinting must be impossible:  - above the maximum capacity plus nine scale intervals,\n- on self- or semi-self-indicating machines when the machine is not in stable equilibrium or not in equilibrium determined as a mean of the oscillations.\nIn all instances, the limits of indication and printing of the results must be identical.\n10.8.1.2. Accuracy of setting\nIt must be possible to adjust tare devices to within one quarter of the smallest verification scale interval of the machine.\nHowever, in the case of non-automatic discontinuous control tare devices, it must be possible to effect the adjustment to within at least half a scale interval.\n10.8.1.5. Visability of operation\nThe operation of tare devices must be visibly indicated when the indication of the machine before taring:  - is 0 75 scale interval or more, in the case of weighing machines with continuous indication,\n- differs from zero, in the case of weighing machines with discontinuous indication.\n10.13.2.1.6. Use of symbols\nThe symbol of the monetary unit must accompany the indication and printing of the price-to-pay and the unit price. This latter must also include the symbol of the unit of mass to which it refers.\nThe figures and the symbols must be printed by the machine on records issued to the contracting parties.\nThe symbols must appear either after each indication or printing of the price-to-pay and/or unit price, or at the head of each corresponding printed column.\n10.13.2.1.10. Value of the price-to-pay scale intervals\nNational regulations shall apply in this regard.\n10.13.2.3.1. Discontinuous indication and printing of the price-to-pay\nThe devices for indicating and printing the price-to-pay must include at least four positions.\nIn the case of a price-to-pay lower than unity, the zero must always appear before the decimal point.\n11.5.1.3. Semi-self-indicating machines with weight receptor\nThese machines shall be authorized if their self-indication range is of the form 1 \u00d7 10n kg (n being a whole number, less than, greater than or equal to zero).\n16.4.4. Repeatability\nRepeatability tests shall be carried out on at least three different loads, between the maximum range and the minimum range, repeating the different weighings ten times each. After each weighing, the machine shall be reset at zero. During these tests, the machine must satisfy the requirements set out in section 5."}
