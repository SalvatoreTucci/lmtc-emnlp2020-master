In line with the approach set out in Decision 2011/523/EU, the suspension should aim at targeting the Syrian authorities, not the people of Syria, and should be limited accordingly. Since gold, precious metals and diamonds are products the trade in which benefits in particular the Syrian regime, and which therefore supports its repressive policies, the suspension should be extended so as to apply also to trade in these materials,", "main_body": ["The measures listed in the Annex to this Decision shall be added to the Annex to Decision 2011/523/EU.", "This Decision shall be notified to the Syrian Arab Republic.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 February 2012.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
