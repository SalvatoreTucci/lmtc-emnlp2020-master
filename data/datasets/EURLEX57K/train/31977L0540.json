MARKINGS      2.1. The samples of a type of parking lamp submitted for EEC component type-approval must bear:        2.1.1. the trade name or mark of the applicant, which must be clearly legible and indelible;\n2.1.2. a clearly legible and indelible marking indicating the type(s) of filament lamp(s) recommended;\n2.1.3. and incorporate a space large enough to contain the EEC component type-approval mark, including the additional symbols prescribed in 4 ; this space shall be shown in the drawings mentioned in 1.2.2.\n3. EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL      3.1. If the two samples submitted in accordance with 1 meet the requirements of Annexes I, II, IV, V and VI, EEC component type-approval shall be granted and a component type-approval number assigned.\n3.2. This number shall not be assigned to any other type of parking lamp.\n3.3. Where EEC component type-approval is requested for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a parking lamp and other lamps, a single EEC component type-approval mark may be issued provided that the lamp in question complies with the requirements of this Directive and that each of the other lamps forming part of the lighting and light-signalling device for which EEC component type-approval is requested, complies with the specific Directive applying to it.\n4.

An example of the EEC component type-approval mark and additional symbol is given in the Appendix.\n4.7. Where a single EEC component type-approval number is issued, as under 3.3, for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a parking lamp and other lamps, one EEC component type-approval mark only may be affixed, consisting of:      - a rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing number or letter(s) of the Member State which has granted the EEC component type-approval,\n- the EEC component type-approval number,\n- the additional symbols required by the various Directives under which EEC component type-approval was granted.\n4.8. The dimensions of the various components of this mark shall not be less than the largest of the minimum dimensions specified for individual markings by the Directives under which the EEC component type-approval was granted.\nAppendix\n>PIC FILE= \"T0011102\">\nANNEX V PHOTOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS\n1.  MEASUREMENT METHODS    1.1. During photometric measurements, stray reflections shall be prevented by appropriate masking.\n1.2. Should the results of measurements be challenged, measurements shall be carried out in such a way as to meet the following requirements:      1.2.1. the distance of measurement shall be such that the law of the inverse of the square of the distance is applicable;\n1.2.2. the measuring equipment shall be such that the angular aperture of the receiver viewed from the reference centre of the lamp is between 10' and 1\u00ba.\n1.2.3.  the intensity requirement for a particular direction of observation shall be deemed to be satisfied if that requirement is met in a direction deviating by not more than 15' from the direction of observation.\n>PIC FILE= \"T0011103\">     2.1. The direction H = 0\u00ba and V = 0\u00ba corresponds to the reference axis (which, when the lamp is mounted on the vehicle, must be horizontal, parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the required direction of visibility). It passes through the centre of reference. The values shown in the table give, for the various directions of measurement, the minimum intensities as a percentage of the minimum required in the axis for each lamp (in the direction H = 0\u00ba and V = 0\u00ba).\n2.2. If visual examination of a lamp appears to reveal substantial local variations of intensity, a check shall be made to ensure that no intensity measured between two of the directions of measurement referred to in 2.1 is:      2.2.1. for a minimum specification, below 50 % of the lower of the two minimum intensities prescribed for these directions of measurement;\n2.2.2. for a maximum specification, above the lower of the two maximum intensities prescribed for these directions of measurement, increased by a fraction, expressed as a linear function, of the difference between the intensities prescribed for the said directions of measurement.\nANNEX VI\n>PIC FILE= \"T0011104\">"}
