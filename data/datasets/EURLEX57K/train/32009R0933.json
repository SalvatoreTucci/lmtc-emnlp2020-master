This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(6).\n(4) Due to the particularities of the transfer from one administrative system to the other, the annual quota to which this Regulation refers should be regarded as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. However, it cannot be excluded that it may become critical within the meaning of that Article, should circumstances change.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1383/2007 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation. However, it would be expedient to continue to apply that Regulation to the import licences issued for the import quota periods prior to those covered by this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation opens the tariff quota indicated in the Annex for the import of poultrymeat products.\nThe tariff quota shall be opened on an annual basis for the period from 1 January to 31 December (import quota period).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quota set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall be managed in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
