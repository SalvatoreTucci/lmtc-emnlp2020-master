The Chinese competent authority has also guaranteed that all consignments will be accompanied by a declaration of the competent authority confirming that the products have been checked before export and including the results of the analytical checks.\n(5) In view of the results and guarantees explained above, it is appropriate to replace the protective measures provided for by Decision 2002/994/EC by a requirement that the consignments concerned be tested at the place of origin before export to the Community, and be accompanied by a corresponding attestation.\n(6) However, the inspection visit still identified some deficiencies as regards the sanitary conditions applied in China to the production of poultry meat intended for export to the Community. In view of those deficiencies, together with the situation created by the outbreaks of avian influenza, the restrictions on imports of poultry meat cannot yet be lifted.\n(7) Decision 2002/994/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/994/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
