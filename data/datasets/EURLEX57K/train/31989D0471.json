When a pig grading apparatus has satisfied the calibration procedure mentioned in paragraph 2, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany shall inform the Commission before the first use of the apparatus by supplying all necessary particulars.\nIn this case the procedure laid down in Article 25 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 shall be applied.", "The use of the method termed 'Zwei-Punkt-Messverfahren' ('ZP'), details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex, is hereby authorized.\nHowever, this method shall only be authorized for abattoirs which do not exceed a weekly slaughtering of 200 pigs as a yearly average.", "Any modification of the apparatus or of the assessment methods (measurement sites and formulae) shall not be authorized.", "Decision 87/43/EEC is hereby repealed.\nHowever, until 30 June 1990, the Federal Republic of Germany may continue to apply the scale for grading pig carcases laid down in Decision 87/431/EEC instead of the scale determined in this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 1989.\nFor the Commission\nRay MAC SHARRY\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 129, 11. 5. 1989, p. 12.\n(3) OJ No L 301, 20. 11. 1984, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 326, 21. 11. 1986, p. 8.\n(5) OJ No L 285, 25. 10. 1985, p. 39.\n(6) OJ No L 17, 20. 1. 1987, p. 38.\nANNEX\nMETHODS FOR GRADING PIG CARCASES IN GERMANY\nPART I\nUltrasound-Scanner (SSD 256)\n1. The assessment method provided for in paragraph 2 is to be used as a method for the grading of pig carcases established on the basis of the values of the measurements obtained by the apparatus known as 'Ultrasound-Scanner' ('SSD 256').\nEvery apparatus used in the abattoir must be calibrated and must give values of the measurements equivalent to those of the Ultrasound-Scanner (SSD 256).\n2. The lean meat content of the carcase is calculated on the basis of the following formula:\n1.2 // y   // = 54,456 - 0,75027 x1 + 0,21181 x2\nwhere:\n1.2 // y   // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the split carcase, between the second and third last ribs,   // x2  // = the thickness of the muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms.\nPART II\nZwei-Punkt-Messverfahren (ZP)\n1. Grading pig carcases may be carried out by use of the method terms 'Zwei-Punkt-Messverfahren' ('ZP').\n2. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2.3.4 // y   // = 47,978 + 26,0429   // S F   // + 4,5154 \u0e22\u0e07 F - 2,5018 log S - 8,4212 \u0e22\u0e07 S.\nwhere:\n1.2,4 // y   // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // S   // = the minimum thickness of visible fat (including rind) on the midline of the split carcase in millimetres, covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius),  // F   // = the visible thickness of the lumbar muscle on the midline of the split carcase in millimetres, measured at the shortest connection between the front (cranial) end of the lumbar muscle and the upper (dorsal) edge of the vertebral canal.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms."}
