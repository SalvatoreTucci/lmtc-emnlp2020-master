In view of the fact that there are few distilleries in some Member States, they are experiencing practical difficulties in completing distillation by the deadlines laid down. Those deadlines should therefore be extended.\n(2) Since the deadline for the delivery of by-products to distilleries provided for in the existing legislation is 15 July of the wine year in progress, this Regulation should apply from 15 July 2007.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
