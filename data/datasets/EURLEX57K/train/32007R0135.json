Article 18(4) of that Regulation provides that if the refund on the sugar incorporated in the products listed in Article 1(2)(b) is insufficient to allow exportation of these products the refund set in line with Article 17 thereof shall apply to them.\n(3) Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that it be ensured that trade flows that have already arisen as a result of granting of export refunds are not disturbed. For that reason the quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87\u00a0(3).\n(4) Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when refunds are set account is taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability on the Community market of products processed from fruit and vegetables and for international trade prices, of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged.\n(5) Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when prices on the Community market are determined account is taken of the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation.\n(6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to differentiate the refund on a given product by destination.\n(7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of provisionally preserved cherries, peeled tomatoes, sugar-preserved cherries, prepared hazelnuts and certain orange juices.\n(8) Export refund rates and quantities should therefore be set for these products.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Export refund rates in the processed fruit and vegetable sector, periods for lodging and for issuing licence applications and the quantities permitted are stipulated in the Annex hereto.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licences for food aid purposes issued as indicated in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(4) shall not be counted against the quantities indicated in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 22 February 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nJean-Luc DEMARTY\nDirector-General for Agriculture and Rural Development\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29.
