This Directive limits itself to the minimum required for the attainment of that objective and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.\n(8) To facilitate access to the markets of non-member countries, it is clearly necessary to establish equivalence between the requirements of this Directive and those of Regulation No 39 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as \"UN-ECE Regulation No 39\").\n(9) The Member States of the European Union must negotiate as soon as possible an amendment to UN-ECE Regulation No 39 to align it with the provisions of this Directive.\n(10) Directive 92/61/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["1.

Marked numerical speed value intervals must not exceed 20 mph and must begin at either 10 mph or 20 mph;\n2.2.4. the marked numerical speed values need not be at regular intervals.\n2.3. The accuracy of the speedometer will be checked in accordance with the following procedure:\n2.3.1. the tyres will be one of the types normally fitted to the vehicle as defined in 1.2. A test will have to be carried out for each type of speedometer intended to be fitted by the manufacturer;\n2.3.2. the load on the wheel spindle driving the speedometer will have to correspond to the mass in running order;\n2.3.3. the reference temperature at the speedometer position must be 296 K \u00b1 5 K;\n2.3.4. during each test, the tyre pressure must be the normal running pressure defined in item 1.3;\n2.3.5. the vehicle will be tested at the following speeds:\n>TABLE>\n2.3.6. the checking device used to measure the actual speed of the vehicle must be accurate to at least \u00b1 0,5 %;\n2.3.6.1. if the tests are carried out on a track, the surface thereof must be flat and dry and provide sufficient grip;\n2.3.6.2. if a rolling-road dynamometer is used for the test, the rollers must have a diameter of at least 2 m. In the case of speedometers intended for mopeds, the test may be carried out on rollers with a diameter of at least 400 mm;\n2.3.7. the speed displayed must never be lower than the actual speed. Between speed V1, read on the speedometer and actual speed V2: there must be the following relationship with the test values specified in item 2.3.5 and between those values:\n0 &lt;= (V1 - V2) &lt;= 0,1 \u00b7 V2 + 4 km/h.\n3. Conformity of production\n3.1. Conformity of production will be checked on the basis of the provisions of Annex VI to Directive 92/61/EEC.\n3.2. Production models will be considered to meet the requirements of this Directive if, under the conditions referred to in items 2.3.1 to 2.3.6, the relationship between speed V1 read on the speedometer and actual speed V2 is as follows:\n0 &lt;= (V1 - V2) &lt;= 0,1 \u00b7 V2 + 4 km/h for mopeds,\nand\n0 &lt;= (V1 - V2) &lt;= 0,1 \u00b7 V2 + 8 km/h for motorcycles and motor tricycles.\nAppendix 1\nINFORMATION DOCUMENT\nin respect of the fitting of a speedometer to a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle\n(to be attached to the application for approval if this is lodged separately from that for approval of the vehicle)\nOrder No (assigned by the applicant)\nThe application for approval in respect of the fitting of a speedometer to two- or three-wheel motor vehicles must include the information referred to in the following items in Section A of Annex II to Directive 92/61/EEC:\n0.1.\n0.2.\n0.5.\n0.6.\n2.1.\n2.1.1.\n4.7 to 4.7.8.\n5.2.\n5.2.2.\nAppendix 2\nTYPE-APPROVAL CERTIFICATE\nin respect of the fitting of a speedometer to a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle\nMODEL\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2000106EN.000602.EPS\">"}
