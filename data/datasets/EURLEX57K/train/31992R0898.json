whereas, pending the entry into force of these Agreements, the Community has decided to apply with effect from 1 March 1992 Interim Agreements concluded with the aforesaid countries,  hereinafter referred to as 'Interim Agreements';\nWhereas Protocol No 7 to the Interim Agreeemnts provides for a proportionate reduction in the quantities available for 1992 to take account of the period which has elapsed between the beginning of 1992 and the entry into force of the Arrangements on 1  March; whereas the actual quantities which may imported in 1992 should therefore be fixed at ten twelfths of the annual quantities;\nWhereas the abovementioned Agreements provide for a reduction in the import levy for fresh, chilled or frozen beef falling within CN codes 0201 and 0202, limited to certain quantities; whereas, in order to ensure the regularity of imports, it is  important to spread out the aforesaid quantities throughout the year;\nWhereas provision is also made for the quantities of meat exported from one of the three beneficiary countries in the context of triangular operations receiving Community financial assistance to be deducted from the available quantities; whereas,  therefore, provision should be made for calculation mechanisms to take account of these operations;\nWhereas, while recalling the provision of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the product, the management of the system should be ensured through import licences; whereas, with that in mind, it would be appropriate to define, in  particular, the detailed rules for submission of applications, as well as the information which must be included on the applications and licences, notwithstanding certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying  down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1599/90 (8), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 of 4  September 1980 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 815/91 (10); whereas provision should also be made for the licences to be  issued after a delay for consideration and, where necessary, with the application of a single percentage reduction;\nWhereas, in order to ensure efficient management of the system, provision should be made for the security in respect of the import licences under the said system to be fixed at ECU 10 per 100 kilograms; whereas the risk of speculation inherent in the  system in question in the beef and veal sector requires that access to the system should be subject to precise conditions;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
