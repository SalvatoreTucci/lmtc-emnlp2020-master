Article 10(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 10(1) to (4) thereof sets out specific provisions for the evaluation of products used in the Union as silage additives.\n(2) In accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the preparations of Pediococcus acidilactici NCIMB 30005, Lactobacillus paracasei NCIMB 30151 and Lactobacillus plantarum DSMZ 16627 were entered in the Register of Feed Additives as existing products belonging to the functional group of silage additives, for all animal species.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, applications\u00a0were submitted for the authorisation of those preparations as feed additives for all animal species, requesting those additives to be classified in the category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and in the functional group\u00a0\u2018silage additives\u2019. Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinions of 6 March 2014\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparations concerned do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment.The Authority also concluded that the preparations of Pediococcus acidilactici NCIMB 30005, Lactobacillus paracasei NCIMB 30151 and Lactobacillus plantarum DSMZ 16627 have the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing the lactic acid concentration and reduce dry matter losses. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparations of Pediococcus acidilactici NCIMB 30005, Lactobacillus paracasei NCIMB 30151 and Lactobacillus plantarum DSMZ 16627 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparations specified in the Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Transitional measures\nThe preparations specified in the Annex and feed containing them, which are produced and labelled before 25 February 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 25 August 2014 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(3):3613; EFSA Journal 2014; 12(3):3611; EFSA Journal 2014; 12(3):3612.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of fresh material\nCategory of technological additives.
