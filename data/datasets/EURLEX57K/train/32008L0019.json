Those measures are designed to adjust the elements eligible for the available solvency margin; extend the list of legal forms; amend the list of classes of insurance or adapt the terminology used in that list; clarify or adjust the items constituting the solvency margin; amend the list of assets acceptable as cover for technical provisions and the rules on the spreading of investments; change the relaxations in the matching rules; clarify definitions; and make the necessary technical adjustments to the rules for setting the maxima applicable to interest rates. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2002/83/EC, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 2002/83/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive 2002/83/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States. It is therefore not necessary to lay down provisions to that effect,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 2002/83/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 64, the introductory wording shall be replaced by the following:\n2.
