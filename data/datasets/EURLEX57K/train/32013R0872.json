Meat products (cooked, salted, smoked, etc.)\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of product to which the name in (1) applies\nAt its release for consumption, the PDO product \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 has a cylindrical shape and solid consistency, with no springiness.\nWhen cut, it is firm and homogenous, with fat globules free from rancidness; the slices have no visible gristle and are a uniform ruby-red colour. The aroma is subtle and distinctive, and the flavour is very mild and subtle and never sour.\nIn addition, when it is released for consumption \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO has the following chemical and physico-chemical characteristics:\n\u2014 total protein content: min. 23\u00a0%\n\u2014 collagen/protein ratio: max. 0,1\n\u2014 water/protein ratio: max. 2\n\u2014 fat/protein ratio: max. 1,5\n\u2014 pH: at least 5,3.\nIn microbiological terms, the product has a mesophilic microbe content of > 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 colony-forming units per gram, with lactobacillus and coccus bacteria most prevalent.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO is made from pork meat: shoulder of pork boned and trimmed using a suitable technique; scrap cuttings; and ground ham, pancetta and/or throats without soft fat, to which salt and crushed and/or ground pepper is added.\nThe following products may also be used: wine, sugar and/or dextrose and/or fructose and/or lactose, starter cultures, sodium and/or potassium nitrate (maximum quantity: 195 parts per million), sodium and/or potassium nitrite (maximum quantity: 95 parts per million), ascorbic acid and its sodium salt, and a very small amount of garlic.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nDetailed rules on the use and composition of the animals\u2019 diet must be respected. Pigs are fed in two stages, and their feed mainly consists of cereal products from the macro-area defined in point 4. By-products from cheese-making (whey, curds and buttermilk) are supplied by dairies located within the defined geographical area.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe production of \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO (cleaning, grinding, mixing of ingredients, filling into casings, drying, ageing) must take place within the traditional production area located in the Brianza region, as defined in point 4.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO must be cut into slices or portions and packaged within the production area defined in point 4, under the supervision of the authorised monitoring body, in order to guarantee the product\u2019s quality. \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 is sensitive to external influences, in particular to light and to oxidation from exposure to the air and to heat. Preparing \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 for slicing of necessity requires the casing to be removed, and the edible part of the product is therefore directly exposed to the air. Exposing the product to external influences under non-controlled conditions alters the organoleptic characteristics of \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019. In order to preserve the product\u2019s original characteristics, \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 must therefore be sliced and packaged immediately after the ageing period and on the production site itself.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\n\u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 may be marketed loose, vacuum-packed or packaged in a modified atmosphere, in whole salami or in portions or slices.\nThe name of the protected designation of origin \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 must appear on the label in clear and indelible letters, fully distinguishable from any other wording, and must be followed immediately by the term \u2018Denominazione di Origine Protetta\u2019 [Protected Designation of Origin].\nThe above name and term must both be written in Italian.\nThe acronym \u2018DOP\u2019 [PDO] may also appear elsewhere on the label, in the same visual field. If a product is destined for international markets, the wording \u2018Protected Designation of Origin\u2019 may be given in the language of the destination country.\nThese details cannot be separated from the PDO logo.\nAny other description not expressly allowed is prohibited.\nHowever, the use of names, trade names and private brands is permitted, provided that they have no laudatory purport and are not such as to mislead the consumer; the names of the pig farms from which the product originates may also be used, provided that the raw material comes exclusively from these farms.\nIf the logo is directly printed on the producers\u2019 label, the number of labels, checked by the authorised monitoring body, must match the amount of raw material destined for production of \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nPig farms producing meat for \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 must be located within the following regions: Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont (the PDO concerned benefits from the derogation granted by Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006).\nThe production area for \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO is located in the Brianza region, bordered to the north by the Ghisallo foothills, to the south by the Villoresi canal, to the east by the deep course of the Adda river, and to the west by the Comasina trunk road (including a 2km outer ring).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe geographical macro-zone in which pig farms providing meat for \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 are located has a highly uniform landscape, especially in the wholly flat area of the Po Valley, which is criss-crossed by rivers and canals and is rich in plant life, with meadows and maize in particular. The climate is characterised by fairly harsh autumns and winters that are very damp and foggy, with mild and rainy springs, and fairly hot summers where short rain showers are quite common and often come in intense bursts.\nWithin this macro-zone, the production micro-zone for \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO is in the Brianza region itself, and offers fertile plains alternating with sun-bathed hills, sheltered by a vast mountain range to the north, which filters the air currents and weather systems, creating various atmospheric phenomena such as air-filtering, warm down-slope winds, cold winds (when the currents blow from the north instead of from the west), and fog.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 has unmistakable characteristics. When cut, the slice is homogenous, ruby-red in colour, and has a firm and compact texture. Its aroma is subtle and distinctive, and the flavour is mild and never sour.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe requisite features of \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO depend on environmental conditions and on natural and human factors.\nIn particular, the properties of the raw material are peculiar to the geographical macro-zone identified in point 4, while the production of \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 is founded on the conditions of the micro-zone described in the same point.\nThe characteristics and natural resources of the macro-zone have in fact enabled the considerable expansion of agriculture and livestock farming, shaping the economic activities in the area today, with a major maize-growing industry and numerous feed manufacturers transforming cereal crops into feed for the huge number of pig and cattle farms in the zone.\nAlthough the macro-zone has always been an ideal source for the raw materials needed for pig-rearing (maize and whey), it is equally true that the geography and morphology of the Brianza region have been key factors in enabling the development of typical products such as \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019.\nThe alpine range that forms the north-west border of the Brianza area actually brings special climatic conditions to the whole Piedmont region: air currents and weather systems are filtered by the vast mountain ranges, creating various atmospheric phenomena such as air-filtering, warm down-slope winds, cold winds (when the currents blow from the north instead of from the west), and fog. All this naturally produces the ideal conditions for ageing \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019, as the fermentation that begins during ageing is due to the array of microbial flora found in the places used for processing and ageing the product, and the microbial flora is itself determined by the environmental characteristics of the zone (temperature, humidity, etc.).\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nThe Ministry launched the national objection procedure with the publication of the proposal for amending the \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 protected designation of origin in Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 8 of 10 January 2008.\nThe full text of the product specification for \u2018Salame Brianza\u2019 PDO can be found:\n\u2014 on the following website:\n\u2014 by going directly to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (at the top right of the screen), and then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
