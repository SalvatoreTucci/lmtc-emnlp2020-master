Fleet overcapacity carries with it a high risk of fishing above the permissible level. Furthermore, the daily catch capacity of one single purse seiner is so high that the permissible catch level can be attained or exceeded very quickly. In these circumstances, any overfishing by this fleet would pose a serious threat to the conservation of the bluefin tuna stock.\n(8) The Commission has been monitoring closely compliance with all requirements of relevant Community rules by Member States during the 2008 bluefin tuna fishing campaign. The information in its possession, as well as the information obtained by Commission inspectors, shows that the Member States concerned have not ensured full compliance with the requirements established in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01559/2007.\n(9) It is therefore necessary that the Commission prohibits as from 16 June 2008 the fishing for bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W and the Mediterranean Sea by purse seiners flying the flag of or registered in Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus and Malta, and as from 23 June 2008 the fishing for bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W and in the Mediterranean Sea by purse seiners flying the flag of or registered in Spain.\n(10) In order to reinforce the effectiveness of these measures designed to forestall a serious threat to the conservation of the bluefin tuna stock, Community operators should also be enjoined not to accept landings, placing in cages for fattening or farming and transhipments of bluefin tuna caught by purse seiners in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W, and the Mediterranean,", "main_body": ["Fishing for bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W, and the Mediterranean by purse seiners flying the flag of or registered in Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus and Malta shall be prohibited as from 16 June 2008.\nIt shall also be prohibited to retain on board, place in cages for fattening or farming, tranship, transfer or land such stock caught by those vessels as from that date.", "Fishing for bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W, and the Mediterranean by purse seines flying the flag of or registered in Spain shall be prohibited as from 23 June 2008.\nIt shall also be prohibited to retain on board, place in cages for fattening or farming, tranship, transfer or land such stock caught by those vessels as from that date.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject to paragraph 2, as from 16 June 2008, Community operators shall not accept landings, placing in cages for fattening or farming, or transhipments in Community waters or ports of bluefin tuna caught in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W, and the Mediterranean Sea by purse seiners.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It shall be allowed to land, place in cages for fattening or farming and to tranship in Community waters or ports of bluefin tuna caught in the Atlantic Ocean, east of longitude 45\u00a0\u00b0W, and the Mediterranean Sea by purse seiners flying the flag of, or registered in Spain until 23 June 2008.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply for six months.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.
