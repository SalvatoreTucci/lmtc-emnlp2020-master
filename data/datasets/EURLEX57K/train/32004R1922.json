Parties therefore agreed to proceed with the adaptation of tariff concessions within the framework of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(1) (hereinafter called the Agreement), which entered into force on 1 June 2002. The adaptation of these concessions, which are listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement, include notably the opening of a Community tariff quota for the import of live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160\u00a0kg.\n(2) It has been agreed with the Swiss Confederation that there should be no trade discontinuity. The procedures for adopting bilaterally a decision to amend Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement will not be completed immediately. In order to ensure that quota benefit is available until the entry into force of the said decision and for reasons of simplification, it is appropriate to open this tariff-quota concession on an autonomous and transitional basis.\n(3) Detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation and, in particular, the provisions required for quota management should be adopted in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal\u00a0(2).\n(4) To be eligible for the benefit of these tariff quotas, products should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Community tariff quota is hereby opened on an autonomous and transitional basis for the period from the date of the entry into force of this Regulation until 30 June 2005 for the import of 4\u00a0600 heads of any live bovine animal originating in Switzerland weighing more than 160\u00a0kg, falling within CN code 0102\u00a090\u00a041, 0102\u00a090\u00a049, 0102\u00a090\u00a051, 0102\u00a090\u00a059, 0102\u00a090\u00a061, 0102\u00a090\u00a069, 0102\u00a090\u00a071 or 0102\u00a090\u00a079.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the products referred to in the first paragraph shall be those provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement.", "The detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 October 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.
