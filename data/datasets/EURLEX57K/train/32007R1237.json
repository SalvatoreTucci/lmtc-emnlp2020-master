In addition, according to that report, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were responsible for 88\u00a0% of the outbreaks where the serovar was demonstrated.\n(6) In view of the high prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium in certain Member States, its public health impact and the reluctance of food business operators to trade table eggs from infected flocks, the date on which restrictions on the consumption of table eggs are to apply, should be brought forward but should still allow food business operators sufficient time to comply with the new requirements without causing any disturbance to markets.\n(7) However, where a flock of laying hens has been indicated as the source of infection in a food borne outbreak as a result of the epidemiological investigation of food-borne outbreaks in accordance with Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17\u00a0November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC\u00a0(6), the restrictions on the use of table eggs set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 should apply without delay.\n(8) Taking account of the public health risk of eggs infected with Salmonella, rules should be laid down on the marking of eggs to guarantee that eggs from flocks which are subject to restrictions within the framework of a Salmonella control programme provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, are marked in a way which easily distinguishes them from table eggs before being placed on the market.\n(9) In order to exclude false-positive initial results, the competent authority should be allowed to lift the restrictions laid down in Paragraph 2 of Part D to Annex II of that Regulation if the Salmonella infection is not confirmed in the flocks of laying hens using a strict protocol.\n(10) Third countries, from which Member States are authorised to import eggs, should provide guarantees, equivalent to the requirements within the Community and the model certificate for eggs in Decision 2006/696/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety\u00a0(7), in particular Article 12 thereof, lays down rules concerning food and feed exported or re-exported from the Community for placing on the market in a third country. Those provisions apply to table eggs. Accordingly, it is not necessary to lay down specific provisions with regard to the export of such eggs in this Regulation.\n(12) To avoid any disturbance of trade, the use of certificates issued in accordance with the current model certificates set out in Decision 2006/696/EC should be allowed for a period of 60 days following the date of application of this Regulation.\n(13) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 should therefore by amended accordingly.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex II to Decision 2006/696/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "Consignments of eggs for which certificates have been issued in accordance with Decision 2006/696/EC in its version before 1\u00a0November 2007 may be imported into the Community for a period of 60 days following that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from:\n\u2014 1 November 2007 where Salmonella ssp. are identified in the flock of laying hens as the source of infection for humans by the consumption of eggs or egg products as a result of the epidemiological investigation of food-borne outbreaks in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2003/99/EC,\n\u2014 1 January 2009 at the latest to all other flocks of laying hens.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 October 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1.

Eggs shall not be used for direct human consumption as table eggs unless they originate from a commercial flock of laying hens subject to a national control programme established under Article 5 and not under official restriction.\n2. Eggs originating from flocks with unknown health status, that are suspected of being infected or that are infected with Salmonella serotypes for which a target for reduction has been set or which were identified as the source of infection in a specific human foodborne outbreak, may be used for human consumption only if treated in a manner that guarantees the destruction of all Salmonella serotypes with public health significance in accordance with Community legislation on food hygiene.\n(a) considered as Class B eggs as defined in Article 2(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 557/2007 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1028/2006 on marketing standards for eggs\u00a0(1);\n(b) marked with the indication referred to in Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 557/2007 which clearly distinguishes them from Class A eggs prior to being placed on the market;\n(c) prohibited access to packaging centres unless the competent authority is satisfied with the measures to prevent possible cross-contamination of eggs from other flocks.\n3. When birds from infected flocks are slaughtered or destroyed, steps must be taken to reduce the risk of spreading zoonoses as far as possible. Slaughtering shall be carried out in accordance with Community legislation on food hygiene. Products derived from such birds may be placed on the market for human consumption in accordance with Community legislation on food hygiene and, once applicable, part E. If not destined for human consumption, such products must be used or disposed of in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.\n4. In order to exclude false-positive initial results, the competent authority may lift the restrictions laid down in point 2 of this Part:\n(a) when the flock of layers is not the source of infection for humans by the consumption of eggs or egg products as a result of the epidemiological investigation of food-borne outbreaks in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2003/99/EC; and\n(b) where the flock is subjected to a national control programme established under Article 5 and Salmonella serotypes for which a target for reduction has been set, is not confirmed by the following sampling protocol carried out by the competent authority:\n(i) the technical specifications referred to in Article 5 of Commission Decision 2004/665/EC (seven samples); however, a sub-sample of 25 grams must be collected of each faecal material and dust sample for analysis; all samples must be analysed separately;\n(ii) bacteriological investigation of the caeca and oviducts of 300 birds;\n(iii) bacteriological investigation of the shell and the content of 4\u00a0000 eggs of each flock in pools of maximum 40 eggs.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 132, 24.5.2007, p. 5.\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2006/696/EC, the model veterinary certificate for eggs (E) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Model veterinary certificate for eggs (E)"}
