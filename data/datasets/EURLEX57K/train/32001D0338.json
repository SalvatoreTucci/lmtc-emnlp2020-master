There is a risk for public health with regard to the imports of bivalve molluscs from or originating in Peru, and it is thus appropriate to suspend them with immediate effect, with the exception of the Pectinidae products, under certain conditions.\n(3) Considering the seriousness of the shortcomings identified during the inspection, the provisions of this Decision must be also applied to the products which have been dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force.\nFurthermore, Pectinidae harvested form certain aquaculture areas and eviscerated and, the adductor muscles of non-aquaculture Pectinidae completely separated from the viscera and gonads, dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force, should be checked in order to demonstrate the absence of marine biotoxins.\n(4) This Decision will be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by the Peruvian authorities and on the basis of the results of a further Community inspection on the spot.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["This Decision shall apply to bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods coming from or originating in Peru.", "1.
