Such reduction is important in view of the strict measures which are to apply to infected flocks in accordance with that Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 from December 2009 on. In particular, eggs originating from flocks with unknown salmonella status, that are suspected of being infected or from infected flocks may be used for human consumption only if treated in a manner that guarantees the elimination of salmonella serotypes with public health significance in accordance with Community legislation on food hygiene.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 provides that the Community target is to include a numerical expression of the maximum percentage of epidemiological units remaining positive and/or the minimum percentage of reduction in the number of epidemiological units remaining positive, the maximum time limit within which the target must be achieved and the definition of the testing schemes necessary to verify achievement of the target. It is also to include a definition, where relevant, of serotypes with public health significance.\n(4) In order to set the Community target, comparable data on the prevalence of the concerned salmonella serotypes in laying hens of Gallus gallus in Member States have been collected in accordance with Commission Decision 2004/665/EC of 22 September 2004 concerning a baseline study on the prevalence of salmonella in laying flocks of Gallus gallus\n\u00a0(2).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 provides that for a transitional period of three years, the Community target for laying hens of Gallus gallus is to cover Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium.\n(6) In order to verify achievement of the Community target, it is necessary to organise repeated sampling of flocks.\n(7) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on the setting of the Community target for laying hens of Gallus gallus.\n(8) Since the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 as regards a Community target for the reduction of the prevalence of certain salmonella serotypes in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus and amending Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, alternative analysis methods have been developed and validated. In addition salmonella strains detected in breeding flocks should be stored for future phagetyping and anti-microbial susceptibility testing. Therefore Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Community target\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community target referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 for the reduction of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in adult laying hens of Gallus gallus (Community target) shall be as follows:\n(a) An annual minimum percentage of reduction of positive flocks of adult laying hens equal to at least:\n(i) 10\u00a0% if the prevalence in the preceding year was less than 10\u00a0%;\n(ii) 20\u00a0% if the prevalence in the preceding year was between 10 and 19\u00a0%;\n(iii) 30\u00a0% if the prevalence in the preceding year was between 20 and 39\u00a0%;\n(iv) 40\u00a0% if the prevalence in the preceding year was 40\u00a0% or more;\n(b) a reduction of the maximum percentage to 2\u00a0% or less; however, for Member States with less than 50 flocks of adult laying hens, not more than one adult flock may remain positive.\nThe first target should be achieved in 2008 based on the monitoring starting in the beginning of that year.
