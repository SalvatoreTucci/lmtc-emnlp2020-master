That opportunity has been used in some cases and the report issued on the outcome has been examined by the Commission.\n(3) Under Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, only agricultural expenditure which has been incurred in a way that has not infringed Community rules may be financed.\n(4) In the light of the verifications carried out, the outcome of the bilateral discussions and the conciliation procedures, part of the expenditure declared by the Member States does not fulfil this requirement and cannot, therefore, be financed under the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, hereinafter referred to as EAGF.\n(5) The amounts that are not recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the EAGF should be indicated.
