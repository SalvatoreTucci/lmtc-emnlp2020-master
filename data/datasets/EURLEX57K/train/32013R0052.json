However, pursuant to points 17 and 18 of Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine\u00a0(2), these products may also be obtained from other products suitable for yielding wine. The reform of the wine sector introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008\u00a0(3) was not intended to amend the list of products used to obtain semi-sparkling wine or aerated semi-sparkling wine. It is therefore necessary to stipulate again that semi-sparkling wine and aerated semi-sparkling wine may also be obtained from new wine still in fermentation, grape must or grape must in fermentation.\n(3) New procedures for producing rectified concentrated grape must make it possible to obtain crystallised rectified concentrated must. The definition of rectified concentrated grape must set out in point 14 of Annex XIb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides only for a liquid form. The definition of rectified concentrated grape must should be adapted in order to include the crystallised form.\n(4) Annex XIb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee established by Article 195(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007,", "main_body": ["Annex XIb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
