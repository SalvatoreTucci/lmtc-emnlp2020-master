They may inform the Commission and Member States of problems relating to the management and socioeconomic and conservation aspects of fisheries and aquaculture in their geographical area or field of competence, and contribute, in close cooperation with scientists, to the collection, supply and analysis of data necessary for the development of conservation measures.\n(3) While Council Decision 2004/585/EC\u00a0(2) establishes seven Regional Advisory Councils, Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 comprises also the four new Advisory Councils, established by that Regulation.\n(4) Since new Advisory Councils are established by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is necessary to define the procedure for the start of their functioning.\n(5) In the light of the important role that the Advisory Councils are expected to play in the regionalised Common Fisheries Policy and in line with the principles of good governance set out in Article 3(b) and (f) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is also necessary to ensure, in line with Article 43(1) of that Regulation, that their structure guarantees a balanced representation of all legitimate stakeholders in the field of fisheries, including small-scale fleets and where appropriate, of aquaculture.\n(6) Small-scale fisheries play an important social, economic, environmental and cultural role in numerous coastal communities throughout the European Union.
