Following the repeal of that Regulation by Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(3), it is necessary to establish the marketing year for flax and hemp grown for fibre in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 245/2001\u00a0(4).\n(2) In Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 reference is made to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes\u00a0(5). As that Regulation has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the relevant reference should be amended accordingly.\n(3) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 makes the payment of the aid for processing flax and hemp straw into fibre subject in particular to the condition to that the parcels sown under flax or hemp grown for fibre have, for the marketing year concerned, been declared by means of the \u2018area\u2019 aid applications as referred to in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 of 23 December 1992 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes\u00a0(6). Since the \u2018area\u2019 aid applications have been replaced by the single application as referred to in Chapter I of Title II of Part II of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system\u00a0(7) provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, it is necessary to amend Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 accordingly.\n(4) Experience has demonstrated that Article 8(5) of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001, obliging the Commission to publish the information forwarded by the Member States concerning the transfers between national guaranteed quantities for long flax fibre and for short flax and hemp fibre in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, entails a considerable administrative work, without bringing an effective contribution to the sector, since the operators already obtain this information through the Member States themselves. In order to simplify the rules governing the aid for processing flax and hemp that provision should be deleted.\n(5) As a result of the repeal of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999, the comparison of information on agricultural parcels under flax or hemp grown for fibre in order to ensure compliance with the conditions for granting the aid for flax fibre or hemp fibre, as referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001, should be made with the information determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n(6) With a view to facilitate procedures, and to the extent that is technically possible, Member States and importers should be given the possibility to issue and use licences through computerised systems for imports of hemp from third countries provided for in Article 17a of Regulation (EC) No 245/2001.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n2.
