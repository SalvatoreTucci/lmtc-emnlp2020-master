The articles of those CN codes can, for example, be made of paper pulp, paper, cellulose wadding or webs of cellulose fibres. They can also be made of combinations of those materials.\n(3) Due to divergent views on the classification of articles falling under CN subheadings 9619\u00a000\u00a071 to 9619\u00a000\u00a089 and in order to facilitate such classification throughout the territory of the Union, it is necessary to further clarify the scope of those new subheadings.\n(4) In the interest of legal certainty, it is thus necessary to insert a new additional note in Chapter 96 of the Combined Nomenclature to ensure a uniform interpretation of those subheadings throughout the Union.\n(5) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 96 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the following Additional note 1 is inserted:\n\u20181.
