GENERAL REMARKS  This programme relates to the whole of the Italian fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Italy.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 262 834 GRT and 1 510 831 kW, in accordance with point II.2 below;\n(b) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity in the category to which the vessels concerned belong.\n2. During the period covered by the programme the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\nmust remain within the following limits:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nMediterranean fleet of which:\n246 255\n263 002\n232 998\n228 338 (\u00b2)\n- inshore fishing\n- near-water fishing\n- Mediterranean middle-water\nfishing\n- middle-water fleet\n6 000\n7 200\n7 056 (\u00b2)\nOcean-going fleet\n29 000\n33 984\n28 000\n27 440 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n275 255\n302 986\n268 187\n299 507\n282 114\n268 198\n262 834\nAuxiliary vessels used for\naquaculture\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Includes vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\nEngine power  (in kW)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nMediterranean fleet of which:\n1 524 128\n1 715 062\n1 471 564\n1 442 133 (\u00b2)\n- inshore fishing\n- near-water fishing\n- Mediterranean middle-water\nfishing\n- middle-water fleet\n23 000\n26 100\n25 578 (\u00b2)\nOcean-going fleet\n44 160\n58 767\n44 000\n43 120 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n1 568 288\n1 796 829\n1 519 695\n1 771 833\n1 643 730\n1 541 664\n1 510 831\nAuxiliary vessels used for\naquaculture\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Includes vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at point II.2, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992, account must also be  taken of changes, if any, in fishing capacity resulting from:\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1991, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction  achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in point III.1.1 is reduced as planned:\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with the new vessels, in line with guidelines and objectives laid down at  point II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reduction which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n(\u00b9) Overall capacity may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programme's objectives.\n3. Introduction of a register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity. The register must be updated to 31 December 1991.\n4. Ruling out of any form of financial assistance (Community, national, regional or other assistance) for vessels using trawls or for manual or power-driven dredgers used to harvest bivalve molluscs.\nIV. COMMENTS   1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence or resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (\u00b9) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 1991."}
