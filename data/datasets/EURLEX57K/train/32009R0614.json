In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Ovalbumin, which is not included in Annex I to the Treaty, is not subject to application of the agricultural provisions of the Treaty, while egg yolk is.\n(3) A situation arises therefrom which may adversely affect the efficiency of the common agricultural policy in the egg sector.\n(4) In order to reach a balanced solution, a common system of trade should be established for ovalbumin corresponding to that established for eggs. It is necessary to extend the application of this system to lactalbumin, in view of the fact that the latter can, to a large extent, be substituted for ovalbumin.\n(5) In pursuance of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)\u00a0(4), a single market system for eggs has been established in the Community.\n(6) The system of trade applicable to albumins should follow the system in force for eggs, in view of the dependence of the former products on the latter.\n(7) Under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community has negotiated various agreements. Several of those agreements concern agriculture, in particular the Agreement on Agriculture\u00a0(5).\n(8) The Agreement on Agriculture requires the abolition of variable import levies and of the other measures and import charges. The rates of customs duty applicable to agricultural products in accordance with the Agreement on Agriculture are to be fixed in the Common Customs Tariff.\n(9) Ovalbumin prices normally follow egg prices, which are different in the Community and on the world market. The price of eggs is not the only factor other than processing costs affecting the price of albumin on the world market. In order to maintain a minimum level of protection against the adverse effects on the market as a result of tarification, the Agreement on Agriculture permits the application of additional customs duties under precisely defined conditions, but only to products subject to tarification.\n(10) The Agreement on Agriculture provides for a series of tariff quotas under arrangements for current and minimum access. The conditions applicable to such quotas are set out in detail in the Agreement on Agriculture. In view of the large number of quotas and in order to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible, the Commission should be responsible for opening and administering them using the management committee procedure.\n(11) By reason of the close economic relationship existing between the various egg products, it is necessary to provide for the possible adoption, for ovalbumin and lactalbumin, of marketing standards which correspond as far as possible with the marketing standards laid down for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(s) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(12) In the common organisation of the market in eggs, the exclusion from recourse to the arrangements for inward processing traffic falls exclusively within the competence of the Council. In the economic conditions arising under the Agreement on Agriculture, it could prove necessary to react rapidly to market problems arising from the application of the said arrangements. In that regard competence should be conferred on the Commission to adopt urgent measures which are limited in time,", "main_body": ["Unless this Regulation provides otherwise, the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff shall apply to the following products:\nCN code Description\n3502 Albumins (including concentrates of two or more whey proteins, containing by weight more than 80\u00a0% whey proteins, calculated on the dry matter), albuminates and other albumin derivatives:\n\u2013 Egg albumin:\nex\u00a03502\u00a011 \u2013\u00a0\u2013 Dried:\n3502\u00a011\u00a090 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 Other (than unfit, or to be rendered unfit, for human consumption)\nex\u00a03502\u00a019 \u2013\u00a0\u2013 Other:\n3502\u00a019\u00a090 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 Other (than unfit, or to be rendered unfit, for human consumption)\nex\u00a03502\u00a020 \u2013 Milk albumin, including concentrates of two or more whey proteins:\n\u2013\u00a0\u2013 Other (than unfit, or to be rendered unfit, for human consumption)\n3502\u00a020\u00a091 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 Dried (for example, in sheets, scales, flakes, powder)\n3502\u00a020\u00a099 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 Other\nCHAPTER II\nTRADE WITH THIRD COUNTRIES", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imports into the Community of any of the products listed in Article 1 may be subject to presentation of an import licence.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licences shall be issued by the Member States to any applicant, irrespective of his place of establishment in the Community and without prejudice to measures taken for the application of Article 4.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licences shall be valid throughout the Community.
