In December 2000, the IMF extended the duration of this financial arrangement to August 2002. Since 1998 the World Bank has provided substantial support for Ukraine's reform efforts, including through the approval in September 1998 of a USD 300 million Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL).

At the request of Ukraine, and where circumstances permit an improvement in the interest rate on the loans, the Commission may refinance all or part of its initial borrowings or restructure the corresponding financial conditions. Refinancing or restructuring operations shall be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and shall not have the effect of extending the average maturity of the borrowing concerned or increasing the amount, expressed at the current exchange rate, of capital outstanding at the date of the refinancing or restructuring.\n4.
