Along with favourable results of the checks carried out by the Commission services and Member States, these measures allowed amendments of Decision 2002/69/EC and the subsequent adoption of several measures to authorise the importation of products of animal origin from China. These amendments were consolidated in Commission Decision 2002/994/EC of 20 December 2002 concerning certain protective measures with regard to the products of animal origin imported from China\u00a0(3), which has repealed Decision 2002/69/EC.\n(3) Results of the checks carried out by Member States on the products authorised for import since the application of Decision 2004/621/EC are generally favourable. This allows consideration of the authorisation of imports from China of petfood. In view of the negligible risk for consumers, it is appropriate to amend the Decision accordingly.\n(4) In order to improve legal clarity over the range of animal products which are prohibited for import from China, it is appropriate to clarify the text of Decision 2002/994/EC.\n(5) Decision 2002/994/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/994/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
