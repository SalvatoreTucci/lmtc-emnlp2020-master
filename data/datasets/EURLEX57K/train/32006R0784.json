It is therefore appropriate to modify Regulation (EC) No 323/2006.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 323/2006 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018By way of derogation from Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, the term of validity of export licences with advance fixing of the refund, which are applied for from 25 May 2006 until 15 June 2006 in respect of the products referred to in point (c) of that Article, shall expire on 30 June 2006.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 May 2006.\nFor the Commission\nJ.
