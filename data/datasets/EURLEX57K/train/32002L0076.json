Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.\n(3) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing this active substance may be authorised.\n(4) With respect to the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of Commission review report. The report was finalised on 16 June 2000. The report fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for metsulfuron methyl at 0,22 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(7) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(8) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs being exceeded. No acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an Acute Reference Dose were noted during the evaluation and discussion preceding the inclusion of metsulfuron methyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional MRLs at the lower limit of analytical determination for all such products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC.\n(6) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for metsulfuron methyl in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.\n(7) The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The Commission notified this Directive in draft form to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received have been considered in finalising the Directive. The possibility of fixing import tolerance MRLs for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the acceptable data submitted.\n(9) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The following maximum pesticide residue level is added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC: \"\"", "The maximum pesticide residue levels for metsulfuron methyl as shown in the Annex to this Directive are added to Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2002 at the latest.
