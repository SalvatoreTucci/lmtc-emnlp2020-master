Lammefjord is situated in Odsherred on Zealand, Denmark. Svinninge Vejle is part of the drained Lammefjord at the innermost end of the fjord. The area was drained before Lammefjord, primarily because it was narrow and shallow. Sidinge Fjord is also a reclaimed area of Isefjord, located north of Lammefjord. Klints\u00f8 is the northernmost area. This was originally a fjord but the mouth was blocked by natural silting. The area is also surrounded by drainage channels.\n- Proof of origin:\nfor:\nLammefjord carrots must be washed and packed by approved washing enterprises on Lammefjord, which is where documentary evidence of origin is kept. One of the conditions imposed on an approved washing enterprise is that records are kept of receipt of carrots from the growing location and there is a clear physical separation of Lammefjord carrots from any other carrots. The Plantedirektorat's IP check is a further check on these conditions.,\nread:\nLammefjord carrots must be washed and packed by approved washing enterprises on Lammefjord, which is where documentary evidence of origin is kept. One of the conditions imposed on an approved washing enterprise is that records are kept of receipt of carrots from the growing location and a clear physical separation of Lammefjord carrots from any other carrots grown on normal sandy soil outside the named areas is guaranteed. The Plantedirektorat's IP check is a further check on these conditions.\n- Link:\nfor:\nThe reclamation of the Lammefjord commenced in 1873. It created exceptionally good agricultural land, given that the former bed of the fjord was mainly silt and therefore very rich in nutrients. The nutrients were created by dead plants and animals falling to the seabed over the millennia and becoming silt (in some places over 20 metres deep). The silt contained sand and also clay particles. Large areas of Lammefjord are more or less free of stones and the large numbers of old mussel and oyster shells give a naturally high calcium content.\nThe former shore zones have sandy soil; the sand has been polished and is smoother and rounder than in classic sandy soils. All the above conditions are of significance for the cultivation of the Lammefjord carrot.,\nread:\nThe first area to be drained in the Lammefjord region was Sidinge Fjord. Then Svinninge Vejle was drained and the reclamation of the largest area, Lammefjord, commenced in 1873. The last area to be drained was Klints\u00f8. It created exceptionally good agricultural land, given that the former bed of the fjord was mainly silt and therefore very rich in nutrients.

Large areas of Lammefjord are more or less free of stones and the large numbers of old mussel and oyster shells give a naturally high calcium content.\nThe former shore zones have sandy soil; the sand has been polished and is smoother and rounder than in classic sandy soils, which means that the carrots do not have cracks in them when they are picked. The dull grey colour which is a characteristic of normal sandy soil carrots is therefore avoided. All the above conditions are of significance for the cultivation of the Lammefjord carrot."}
