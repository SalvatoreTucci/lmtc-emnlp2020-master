whereas the Commission has carried out the  necessary verifications in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91 (3), provided for the supply of canned beef to the people of the ex-Soviet Union in the framework of Council Regulation (EEC) No 598/91 of 5 March 1991 on an emergency action for the Soviet Union (4);  whereas the processing and canning of the meat was awarded by tendering procedures; whereas the meat to be processed came from the intervention stocks of Germany;\nWhereas a considerable part of the canned beef produced by certain Italian firms and supplied to the ex-USSR proved to be unfit for human consumption; whereas additionally, it was found that in certain cases the meat content of the cans did not  correspond to the specifications laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91; whereas the affected canned beef not being identifiable by lot, the totality of the produce supplied had to be retrieved and will have to be destroyed; whereas the  deterioration of the produce was found to be due to the insufficiency of the sterilization operation for the meat to be processed and this is attributable to the producing firm; whereas the permanent physical controls which had to be effected in  accordance with Article 9 of the said Regulation did not allow the detection of the abovementioned procesing faults; whereas, in consequence, the Italian intervention agency incorrectly paid the processing costs to the successful tenderers and did not  acquire the securities constituted in accordance with Article 6 (3) of the aforementioned Regulation; whereas the associated positive and negative expenditure which was supported by the Fund in 1991 may no longer be taken in charge by the Community  budget;\nWhereas the Member State in question has been informed in detail of the corrections provided for by this decision and has been able to make known its position on this subject;\nWhereas Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1723/72 of 26 July 1972 on making up accounts for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 295/88 (6), provides that the  decision to clear accounts shall include the determination of the amount of expenditure incurred in each Member State during the financial year in question recognized as chargeable to the Guarantee Section of the Fund; whereas this provision does not  exclude the Commission from clearing, before and outside of the global decision on the clearance of accounts, certain parts of the annual accounts concerning expenditure relevant to specific measures; whereas in this particular case, having regard to  the gravity of the control weaknesses found and the pressing political necessity to replace the canned beef which is unfit for consumption, the Commission is led to avail itself of this facility; whereas this decision does not prejudice the clearance of  accounts decision for the 1991 financial year for the Member State concerned with regard to expenditure not covered by this decision;\nWhereas the Commission reserves the possibility to proceed, within the appropriate legal framework, to the recovery of the expenses it has incurred which also result from the insufficient application by the Member State in question of the control  provisions in this particular case, in addition to those expenses which are the subject of this decision; whereas this concerns in particular the expenses linked to the loss of the intervention meat used, in so far as these expenses exceed the amount of  the securities released, as well as the costs of storage, re-transport and destruction of the canned beef;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 102 of the Financial Regulation, of 21 December 1977 (7), as last amended by Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 610/90 (8), the result of the clearance of accounts decision, constituting the difference between the  total of the expenditure booked for the financial year in question in application of Articles 100 and 101 and the total expenditure recognized by the Commission at the clearance, is booked under a single article as additional expenditure or a reduction  in expenditure,", "main_body": ["The amount recognized as chargeable to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, relative to the expenditure declared by Italy for the 1991 financial year for the execution of the operations provided for in  Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91, as identified in the Annex, amount, in accordance with the same Annex:\n- for Italy to Lit 15 772 655 660.", "The amounts set out at point 3 of the Annex are to be booked with the expenditure referred to at Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88 (9) for the month of April 1994.", "This Decision is addressed to Italy."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 94, 28. 4. 1970, p. 13.\n(2) OJ No L 185, 15. 7. 1988, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 147, 12. 6. 1991, p. 20.\n(4) OJ No L 67, 14. 3. 1991, p. 19.\n(5) OJ No L 186, 16. 8. 1972, p. 1.\n(6) OJ No L 30, 2. 2. 1988, p. 7.\n(7) OJ No L 356, 31. 12. 1977, p. 1.\n(8) OJ No L 70, 16. 3. 1990, p. 1.\n(9) OJ No L 249, 8. 9. 1988, p. 9.\nANNEX\nITALY  \"\" ID=\"1\">1.
