In the cereals sector, one of these concessions is the elimination as of 1 July 2002 of refunds on most of the products referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.\n(2) Since Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002 was not adopted and published until the end of July, at 1 July 2002 Hungary had not been excluded from the eligible destinations under the invitation to tender for export refunds on common wheat opened by Commission Regulation (EC) No 899/2002(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1520/2002(5). However, since refunds were granted during that period under the tendering procedure concerned, flat-rate negative corrections have been introduced for exports to Hungary to prepare for the retroactive application of the EC-Hungary trade agreement, and this has led to a situation of differentiated refunds.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1323/2002(6) provides that proof that the customs import formalities have been completed, as required by Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/2002(8), is not to be required for payment of the refund where the differentiation of the refund is the result solely of a refund not having been fixed for Hungary.\n(4) Since the Hungarian authorities have undertaken not to grant preferential duty to cereal products imported into Hungary unless the goods are accompanied by documents certifying that they have not received a refund, and since there is no danger of deflection of trade, the derogation provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1323/2002 should also be granted in the case where the refund is set at zero by means of negative corrections.\n(5) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1323/2002 should therefore be supplemented accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1323/2002 is replaced by the following: \"Article 1\n1. As an exception to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, where the differentiation of the refund is the result solely of a refund not having been fixed for Hungary or the setting at zero of that refund by means of negative corrections, proof that customs formalities for importation have been completed shall not be required for payment of the refund for the products listed in the Annex to this Regulation.\n2.
