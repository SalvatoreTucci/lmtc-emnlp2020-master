The Commission has published in the Official Journal successive lists of bicycle assemblers\u00a0(5) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(2) Following the last publication of the list of parties under examination\u00a0(6), a period of examination has been selected. Due to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania it was decided to determine an examination period from 1 January 2006 until 30 June 2007 so that in the same procedure also requests for exemptions submitted by Bulgarian and Romanian bicycle assemblers could be analysed. A questionnaire was sent to all parties under examination, requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nA.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceptable requests for exemption\n(3) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests.

In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.\n(7) It is to be noted that the following party listed in table 1 informed the Commission services of a change in its registered seat during the examination period:\n\u2014 Leader-96 Ltd. transferred its registered office from 3 Mostova Str., 4002 Plovdiv, Bulgaria to 19 Sedianka Str., 4003 Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\n(8) It has been established that this change in the address of the registered office did not affect the assembly operation with regard to the stipulations of the exemption Regulation and therefore the Commission does not consider that this change should affect the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nA.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unacceptable requests for exemption and withdrawals\n(9) The parties listed in table 2 below also submitted requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nIsaac International Ltd. 4 Axis Park, P014 1FD Fareham Hants, Hampshire United Kingdom A816\nLoris Cycles di Perinel Lori Via delle Industrie 8, 30022 Ceggia (VE) Italy A731\nROG Kolesa d.d.

In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the requests submitted by these parties.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nB.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inadmissible requests for exemption\n(13) The parties listed in table 3 also submitted requests for exemption from the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty:\nName Address Country\nMannheimer Strasse 80,\n68535 Edingen-Neckarhausen\nEts.
