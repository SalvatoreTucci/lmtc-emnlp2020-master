The Employment Guidelines adopted by Council Decision 2008/618/EC\u00a0(3), which are an integral part of the \u2018Integrated Guidelines Package\u2019, which is designed to spur growth and jobs in Europe as part of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, call for particular attention to be paid to significantly reducing the employment gaps for people at a disadvantage, including the gap between third country nationals and EU citizens. They explicitly state that combating discrimination and integrating immigrants is essential and call for appropriate management of economic migration to improve matching of labour market needs. Appropriate data to monitor these issues are extremely important, especially since, given the ageing of the EU labour force and predicted skill shortages, the need for migrant workers will continue to grow in future years.\n(5) In the context of the ongoing debate on flexicurity and the expressed need for greater adaptability of both enterprises and workers in Europe, a key issue highlighted in the European Employment Strategy and the Employment Guidelines, it is necessary to have data from a large-scale European survey on the extent of application of various forms of new work organisation practices and working time arrangements and workers\u2019 experiences with these.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,", "main_body": ["The programme of ad-hoc modules for the labour force sample survey, covering the years 2013 to 2015, as set out in the Annex, is hereby adopted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a077, 14.3.1998, p.\u00a03.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2014 Improving quality and productivity at work: Community strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work, adopted on 21.2.2007 \u2014 COM(2007) 62.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0198, 26.7.2008, p.\u00a047.\nANNEX\nLABOUR FORCE SURVEY\nMultiannual programme of ad-hoc modules\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ACCIDENTS AT WORK AND OTHER WORK-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS\nList of variables: to be defined before December 2011.\nReference period: 2013.
