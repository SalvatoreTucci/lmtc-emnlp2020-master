Specific provisions relating to the labelling of products containing PCBs and PCTs\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of other Directives relating to the labelling of dangerous substances and preparations, Member States may require equipment and plant containing PCBs or PCTs also to display instructions concerning the disposal of PCBs and PCTs and the maintenance and use of equipment and plant containing them. These instructions must be capable of being read horizontally when the object containing the PCBs or PCTs is installed in the normal way. The inscription must stand out clearly from its background.\nMember States may require the inscription to be in a language which is understood in their territory.'", "1.
