Cases of direct allergic reactions, some of them severe, have been documented and studies show that there is a relatively high risk of a cross-allergy to lupin in between 30\u00a0% and 60\u00a0% of persons who are allergic to peanuts.\n(5) In the case of molluscs (gastropods, bivalves or cephalopods), the EFSA states in its opinion of 15 February 2006 that they are most often consumed in their current state but are also used as ingredients, after any processing, in a number of preparations and in products such as surimi. Allergic reactions, which can be serious, affect up to 0,4\u00a0% of the population, i.e. 20\u00a0% of all cases of allergic reactions to seafood. The main allergenic protein in molluscs is tropomyosin, which is the same as that in crustaceans, and cases of cross-allergies between molluscs and crustaceans occur frequently.\n(6) It can be concluded from these observations that lupin and molluscs should be added to the list in Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive comply with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The following ingredients shall be added to Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC:\n\u2018Lupin and products thereof\nMolluscs and products thereof.\u2019", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall, as from 23 December 2007, authorise the sale of foodstuffs which comply with this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall, as from 23 December 2008, prohibit the sale of foodstuffs which fail to comply with this Directive.
