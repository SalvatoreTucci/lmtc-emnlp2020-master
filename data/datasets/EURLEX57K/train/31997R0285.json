Previous procedure\n(1) The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 738/92 (2), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of cotton yarn falling with CN codes 5205 11 00 to 5205 45 90 and 5206 11 00 to 5206 45 90 originating, inter alia, in Turkey. Sampling was applied to Turkish exporters, and individual duties ranging from 4,9 % to 12,1 % were imposed on the companies in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample received a weighted average duty of 9 %. A duty of 12,1 % was imposed on companies which either did not make themselves known or did not cooperate in the investigation.\nB. Amendment\n(2) Pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, a new exporter's review to determine individual dumping margins could not be initiated in this proceeding, as sampling was used in the original investigation. However, in order to ensure equal treatment between any new exporters and the cooperating companies not included in the sample during the original investigation, it is considered that provision should be made for the weighted average duty imposed on the latter companies to be applied to any new exporters which would otherwise be entitled to a review pursuant to Article 11 (4),", "main_body": ["The following paragraph shall be added to Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 738/92:\n'6.
