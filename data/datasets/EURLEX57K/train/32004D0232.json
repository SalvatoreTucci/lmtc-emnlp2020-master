Since that time, any halon 2402 required has had to be obtained from specialised storage facilities which have stored halon that has been replaced by alternatives.\n(3) Halon 2402 has wide-ranging application in the States that will accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 for fire and explosion suppression in the military and non-military sectors where it is used, for example, in nuclear facilities as well as terrestrial, marine and air transportation.\n(4) The replacement of halon fire-fighting equipment with alternative fire protection agents needs to take into account the availability of technically and economically feasible alternatives or technologies that are acceptable from the point of view of environment and health. Refit activities to install equipment that does not rely on halon for fire and explosion protection in military applications needs to be scheduled in a way that avoids unacceptably compromising the defense capability of the States that will accede to the European Union. Special budgetary consideration and a period of time to convert to an alternative are often needed to adapt alternative fire-protection agents to perform safely and effectively.\n(5) Article 4(4)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 requires halon installed in equipment that is not listed as a critical use in Annex VII to have been decommissioned by 31 December 2003 and the halon recovered in accordance with Article 16. In order to qualify for a critical-use exemption that would allow the continued use of halon 2402 in the countries that will accede to the European Union after that date, Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should be amended to allow this fire-extinguishing agent to be used for a range of applications.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 244, 29.9.2000, p. 1.
