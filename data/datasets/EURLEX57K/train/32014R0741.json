For the sake of clarity, it is also appropriate to add new fleet segmentation codes for Mayotte.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the tenth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 28.12.2013, p.\u00a022.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 of 30 December 2003 on the Community fishing fleet register (OJ L\u00a05, 9.1.2004, p.\u00a05).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2104/2004 of 9 December 2004 laying down detailed implementing rules for Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions (OJ L\u00a0365, 10.12.2004, p.\u00a019).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 of 30 March 2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions (OJ L\u00a0102, 7.4.2004, p.\u00a09).\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) The following Table 1a is inserted after Table 1:\nMember States Country Code\nBelgique/Belgi\u00eb BEL\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f BGR\nDanmark DNK\nDeutschland DEU\nEesti EST\n\u00c9ire/Ireland IRL\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 GRC\nEspa\u00f1a ESP\nFrance FRA\nHrvatska HRV\nItalia ITA\n\u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 CYP\nLatvija LVA\nLietuva LTU\nMalta MLT\nNederland NLD\nPolska POL\nPortugal PRT\nRom\u00e2nia ROM\nSlovenija SVN\nSuomi/Finland FIN\nSverige SWE\nUnited Kingdom GBR\u2019\n(2) Table 3 is replaced by the following:\nGear Category Gear Code Static (S) or towed (T) or mobile gear (M) Pelagic (P) or demersal (D)\nSurrounding nets Purse seines PS M P\nLampara nets LA M P\nSeines Beach seines SB T D/P\nDanish seines SDN T D/P\nScottish seines SSC T D/P\nPair seines SPR T D/P\nTrawls Beam trawl TBB T D\nBottom otter trawl OTB T D\nBottom pair trawls PTB T D\nMidwater otter trawls OTM T D/P\nPelagic pair trawls PTM T D/P\nOtter twin trawls OTT T D/P\nDredges Boat dredges DRB T D\nHand dredges used on board a vessel DRH T D\nMechanised dredges including suction dredges HMD T D\nLift nets Boat-operated lift nets LNB M P\nShore-operated stationary lift nets LNS M P\nGill nets and entangling nets Set (anchored) gill nets GNS S D\nDriftnet GND S D/P\nEncircling gill nets GNC S D/P\nTrammel nets GTR S D/P\nCombined trammel and gill nets GTN S D/P\nTraps Pots (traps) FPO S D\nHook and lines Hand lines and pole lines (hand operated) LHP S D/P\nHand lines and pole lines (mechanised) LHM S D/P\nSet longlines LLS S D\nLonglines (drifting) LLD S P\nTroll lines LTL M P\nGrappling and Wounding Harpoons HAR M P\nGear unknown\u00a0(1)  NK\nNo gear\u00a0(2)  NO\n(3) Table 5 is replaced by the following:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date of event before 31.12.2002\nFleet Segment codes\nMember States MAGP codes\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Date of event from 1.1.2003\nFleet segments Segment codes\nMainland MFL\nAquaculture AQU\nSpain \u2014 outermost regions:\nCanary Islands.
