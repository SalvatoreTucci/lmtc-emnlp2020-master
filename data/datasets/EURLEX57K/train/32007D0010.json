That Decision suspends the importation of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs, fresh meat and meat preparations and meat products from these species.\n(3) Bulgaria confirmed outbreaks of Newcastle disease in one municipality of the administrative district of Dobrich and in one municipality of the administrative district of Razgrad in Bulgaria.\n(4) Taking account of the current epidemiology situation in Bulgaria in relation to Newcastle disease and the fact that this country has applied certain disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission, it appears that the situation in Bulgaria, except for the districts of Vratsa, Blagoevgrad, Kardzhali, Burgas (excluding the municipalities of Burgas and Sungurlare), for the municipality of Dobrichka situated in the district of Dobrich and for the municipality of Kubrat situated in the district of Razgrad is still satisfactory. It is therefore appropriate to limit the suspension of imports to those regions.\n(5) The Annex to Decision 2005/648/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Decision 2005/648/EC the Annex is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
