To achieve that objective it is necessary to prevent and combat crime, organised and other, including corruption.\n(2) The Stockholm programme \u2014 An open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens\u00a0(1), adopted by the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009, invites the Commission to develop indicators, on the basis of existing systems and common criteria, to measure efforts in the fight against corruption, in particular in the areas of the acquis (public procurement, financial control, etc.).\n(3) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 22 November 2010 on the EU Internal Security Strategy in Action: Five steps towards a more secure Europe\u00a0(2) stresses that sustaining political will to combat corruption is of key importance and that action at Union level and sharing of best practices is necessary. It announces a Commission proposal in 2011 on how to monitor and assist Member States' anti-corruption efforts.\n(4) The Commission Decision of 6 June 2011 establishing an EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism for periodic assessment (\u2018EU Anti-Corruption Report\u2019)\u00a0(3) lays down the objectives and the necessary elements for the implementation of the EU Anti-Corruption Report. In accordance with that Decision, that report is to be published every two years, starting in 2013. The Report is to be managed by the Commission, assisted by an expert group appointed by the Commission following an open call procedure. The members of the expert group must have undisputed expertise, a high level of integrity and a reputation in the field of fighting corruption.\n(5) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee of 6 June 2011 on fighting corruption in the EU\u00a0(4) provides that the experts who are to assist the Commission in the work on the EU Anti-Corruption Report may come from a wide range of backgrounds, such as law enforcement, prevention, civil society, and must undertake to act in their personal professional capacity.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the field of anti-corruption and to define its tasks and its structure.\n(7) The group should support the Commission's work on the EU Anti-Corruption Report and on any future Union policies deriving from it. In particular, the group should advise on matters such as: identifying cross-cutting and country-specific issues to be covered by each report, developing indicators, assessing the Member States' performance, identifying best practices, identifying EU trends, making recommendations and proposing EU measures where appropriate.\n(8) The group should be composed of 17 members and ensure a balanced representation in terms of institutional and professional background and geographic regions.\n(9) Rules should be laid down on disclosure of information by members of the group.\n(10) Personal data relating to members of the group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(5).\n(11) The term of office of the members should be four years and should be renewable,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe Group of Experts on Corruption, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the group\u2019, is hereby set up.", "Tasks\nThe group's tasks shall be:\n(a) to advise the Commission on matters related to the EU Anti-Corruption Report, including the working methodology, as well as on matters related to EU anti-corruption policy, by means of oral and written contributions, as appropriate and agreed with the Commission;\n(b) to help the Commission assess the evolution of anti-corruption policies at national, European and international levels and to assist the Commission in identifying EU trends in corruption;\n(c) to assist the Commission in identifying relevant standards for the fight against corruption, as well as measurable indicators against which the assessments of the EU Anti-Corruption Report may be carried out;\n(d) to assist the Commission in identifying ways of streamlining relevant information on the nature, extent and causes of corruption in the Member States, as well as on the effectiveness of efforts against corruption;\n(e) to assist the Commission in identifying cross-cutting and country-specific anti-corruption issues, of relevance for the Union and for the Member States, as well as possible recommendations to be made in the EU Anti-Corruption Report;\n(f) to advise the Commission on developing methodologies for assessing anti-corruption efforts in the EU-27;\n(g) to assist the Commission in identifying and defining possible relevant measures and actions at Union and national level across the range of anti-corruption policies;\n(h) to assist the Commission in identifying best practices and ways of experience sharing and peer learning which can be further developed at Union level.", "Consultation\nThe Commission may consult the group on any matter relating to the EU Anti-Corruption Report and EU anti-corruption policy.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The group shall be composed of 17 members.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members shall be individuals of proven expertise and experience in the prevention and fight against public and private sector corruption, and in the monitoring and/or evaluation of anti-corruption policies and practices.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the group shall reflect the required balance of expertise required on anti-corruption matters, and the various aspects involved, such as, but not limited to, law enforcement, the judiciary, prevention, policy-making, monitoring and/or supervision, research into trends, policies and/or indicators, the public and private sector, criminal law, and economic and social aspects/impacts.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members shall be nationals of a Member State of the European Union.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members shall be appointed by the Director-General of the Commission's Directorate-General for Home Affairs from among those who have responded to the call for applications (see Annex to the present Decision).\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of the call for applications, applicants who were deemed suitable candidates for group membership but were not appointed shall be placed on reserve list, with their consent.
