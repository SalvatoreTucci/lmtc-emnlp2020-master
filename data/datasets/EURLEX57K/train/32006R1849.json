The assessment reports should be derived from the original competent authority report as amended in the light of all the documents, comments and information taken into account during the evaluation process.\n(2) In order to increase legal certainty, provision should be made for the phasing-out, after 1 September 2006, of biocidal products containing notified active substances for which a decision has been taken not to include them, for certain or all of their notified product-types, in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC, either because they were withdrawn from the review programme or because they were found not acceptable after evaluation.\n(3) In accordance with Article 4b of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003\u00a0(2), the Member States have examined dossiers requesting an extension of the period for the placing on the market of biocidal products containing specific active substances and have accepted those which were complete. It is therefore appropriate to allow the substances covered by the accepted dossiers to remain on the market after 1 September 2006, until they are assessed under the 10-year review programme.\n(4) For a number of notified existing active substances or product type combinations, the participants have either withdrawn their notifications or failed to comply with their obligations, while no other economic operator or Member State has expressed an interest in obtaining the status of participant within the given deadlines. Annexes II, III and V to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) In the case of one of the substances listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 under the EC number 404-690-8, two product-types have been omitted, although they were notified within the time limits laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000 of 7 September 2000 on the first phase of the programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on biocidal products\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) 1687/2002 of 25 September 2002 on an additional period for notification of certain active substances already on the market for biocidal use as established in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000\u00a0(4). Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The names of certain substances covered by the BKC and DDAC entries listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 also appear in Annex III to that Regulation. The respective entries should therefore be deleted from Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 is amended as follows:\n1.
