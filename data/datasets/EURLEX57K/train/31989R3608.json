Quantities shall be charged against the ceilings as and when the products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation accompanied by a movement certificate in accordance with the rules contained in the Protocol concerning the  definition of the concept of \u00b4originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation annexed to the Protocol laying down certain provisions relating to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and Malta  (9).\nGoods may be charged against the ceiling only if the movement certificate is submitted before the date on which customs duties are re-established.\nThe extent to which a ceiling is used up shall be determind at Community level on the basis of the imports charged against it in the manner defined in the preceding subparagraphs.\nMember States shall inform the Commission of imports charged in accordance with the above procedure at\nthe intervals and within the time limits specified in\nparagraph 4.\n(10) OJ No L 111, 28. 4. 1976, p. 3.\n3.
