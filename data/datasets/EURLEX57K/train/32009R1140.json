Milk and milk products are, however, not\u00a0covered by that Article.\n(6) In view of the serious difficulties and the increasing price volatility on the dairy market it is appropriate to enlarge the scope of Article 186 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 to milk and milk products, thus enabling the Commission to react to market disturbances in a flexible and swift manner.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be amended as follows:\n1.
