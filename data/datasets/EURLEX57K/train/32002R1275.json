It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81.\n(4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances, to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations.\n(5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination.\n(6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(4).\n(7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6), Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The list of products on which the export refund specified in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 is granted and the amount of the refund shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.\nThe products concerned must comply with the relevant provisions on health marks laid down in:\n- Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC,\n- Chapter VI of Annex I to Directive 94/65/EC,\n- Chapter VI of Annex B to Directive 77/99/EEC.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 15 July 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 156, 29.6.2000, p. 5.\n(3) OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 153, 13.6.2002, p. 8.\n(5) OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 2012/64.\n(6) OJ L 243, 11.10.1995, p. 7.\n(7) OJ L 368, 31.12.1994, p. 10.\n(8) OJ L 26, 31.1.1977, p. 85.\n(9) OJ L 10, 16.1.1998, p. 25.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 12 July 2002 fixing the export refunds on pigmeat\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and the \"A\" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 27.3.2002, p. 1) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\nP05 All destinations except the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania."}
