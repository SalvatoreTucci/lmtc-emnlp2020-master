If the adjustment figure is negative, the relevant quantity should be calculated by increasing the annual emission allocations as laid down in Decision 2013/162/EU by the adjustments set out in this Decision.\n(4) To ensure consistency between the determination of the annual emission allocations, the adjustments thereto and the reported greenhouse gas emissions for each year, Member States\u2019 adjustments to the annual emission allocations should also be calculated by applying the global warming potential values from the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change adopted by Decision 15/CP.17 of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
