Products within those tariff quotas can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates. For the same reasons relating to supplies and disturbances it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2013, new tariff quotas at reduced or zero duty rates for an appropriate volume for the ten products with order numbers 09.2644 and 09.2663 to 09.2671.\n(2) Moreover, for the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order numbers 09.2620 and 09.2633 the product description should be adapted, and for order number 09.2629 another TARIC code should be added.\n(3) For the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with the order numbers 09.2917 and 09.2632, an end date of 31 December 2013 should be inserted, as it is not in the interest of the Union to continue granting such quotas beyond that date.\n(4) Since the new tariff quotas should take effect from 1 July 2013, this Regulation should apply from that date and enter into force immediately upon its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the rows with order numbers 09.2644 and 09.2663 to 09.2671 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted;\n(2) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2620, 09.2629, 09.2632, 09.2633 and 09.2917 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
