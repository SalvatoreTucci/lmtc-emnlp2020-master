In the face of further difficulties with this programme, identified in the course of a mission to the United States of America by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, the programme was suspended in July 1999 and relaunched in September 1999, in an enhanced form as the non-hormone-treated cattle programme.\n(4) Commission Decision 1999/518/EC(5) further amended the inspection measures at Community border inspection posts to include specific testing for stilbenes following the detection by the competent authorities of Switzerland of diethylstilboestrol (DES) in beef meat imported from the United States.\n(5) In the light of the favourable results under the testing programme, in September 2000 Commission Decision 2000/583/EC(6) reduced the frequency of checks on fresh meat imported from the United States of America from checks on all consignments to checks on 20 % of consignments, and removed the obligation on Member States to only allow the entry into their territory of consignments for which the results of examination and analyses were favourable.\n(6) This Decision was a first step towards phasing out completely the obligation to test for hormones each consignment selected for physical checks, and the Decision was subject to review in the light of future test results in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 1999/302/EC.\n(7) The additional controls put in place by Decision 1999/302/EC and Decision 1999/518/EC and the testing carried out under the European Community additional testing programme for hormones, have not resulted in any positive samples of fresh bovine meat and offal being identified during the intervening period.\n(8) It is therefore appropriate to repeal the requirement for 20 % of consignments of meat imported from the United States of America to be tested for the possible presence of hormones, and in respect of laboratory tests to treat such imports on the same basis as imports of meat from other third countries.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 94/360/EC is amended as follows:", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 March 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(2) OJ L 373, 31.12.1990, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 158, 25.6.1994, p. 41.\n(4) OJ L 117, 5.5.1999, p. 58.\n(5) OJ L 197, 29.7.1999, p. 50.\n(6) OJ L 246, 30.9.2000, p. 67."}
