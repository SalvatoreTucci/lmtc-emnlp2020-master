As the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has recently changed constitution and name to become \"Serbia and Montenegro\", the request (to have all waste covered by Annex D of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2243/2001(6)) should be reflected in the new entry, bearing the new country name.\n(3) On 27 February 2003, the Commission was officially informed by Tanzania of a change in the procedure applicable to imports from the Community of waste recovery.
