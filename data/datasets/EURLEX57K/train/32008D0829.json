It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin. For that purpose, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof (\u2018countries or regions\u2019) is to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved, namely a negligible BSE risk, a controlled BSE risk and an undetermined BSE risk.\n(2) The Annex to Commission Decision 2007/453/EC of 29 June 2007 establishing the BSE status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof according to their BSE risk\u00a0(2) lists countries or regions according to their BSE risk status.\n(3) Pending the final conclusion on the BSE risk status of the Member States, all Member States were provisionally recognised as countries with a controlled BSE risk as laid down in Decision 2007/453/EC. During the OIE General Session in May 2008, a Resolution was adopted relating to the BSE status of different countries. The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be brought in line with the recommendations of the Resolution of the OIE. Pending a final conclusion on the BSE risk status of certain Member States and taking into account the harmonised stringent BSE protective measures applied within the Community, those Member States should remain provisionally recognised as countries with a controlled BSE risk.\n(4) Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on 1 December 2008.\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 84.\nANNEX\nLIST OF COUNTRIES OR REGIONS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a negligible BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Finland\n\u2014 Sweden\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Iceland\n\u2014 Norway\nThird countries\n\u2014 Argentina\n\u2014 Australia\n\u2014 New Zealand\n\u2014 Paraguay\n\u2014 Singapore\n\u2014 Uruguay\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a controlled BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, the United Kingdom\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Switzerland\n\u2014 Liechtenstein\nThird countries\n\u2014 Brazil\n\u2014 Canada\n\u2014 Chile\n\u2014 Taiwan\n\u2014 Mexico\n\u2014 United States\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with an undetermined BSE risk\n\u2014 Countries or regions not listed in points A or B of this Annex."}
