whereas the entry on the certificate is made in accordance with Article 3 (6) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 131/92 (14), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2596/93 (15), as regards the French overseas departments  and in accordance with Article 4 (7) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1695/92 (16), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2596/93, and (EEC) No 1696/92 (17), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2596/93, as regards the Canary Islands and the Azores  and Madeira respectively; whereas the entry on the 'aid' certificate is made at the destination by the local authorities on presentation of the products to which it refers;\nWhereas there is a significant reduction in common prices with effect from the 1993/94 marketing year; whereas as a result of the time needed for consignments to reach the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands from the  continental part of the Community, this adjustment is likely to penalize operators having supply commitments at the end of the marketing year;
