This Decision also provides for the conditions under which exemptions to the restrictions applicable to animal movements laid down by the Directive can be implemented.\n(2) As regards Greece, the surveillance programme carried on by Greek authorities has demonstrated no seroconversion on sentinel animals during the year 2002.\n(3) Therefore provisions can be made to relax, under certain conditions, the restrictions on movements of live animals of susceptible species from the Greek territory, with the exception of areas which are under threat of direct reinfestation from third countries.\n(4) As regards Italy and France, the surveillance programmes carried out in Italy and France have demonstrated that in areas where the vaccination has been correctly implemented, virus circulation has been reduced to a negligible level before the winter season.\n(5) Therefore provisions can be made to relax, under certain conditions, restrictions on movements of vaccinated live animals from those areas.\n(6) However, the main condition for implementing these relaxation measures should be that the surveillance programme in place does not show that bluetongue virus activity has recommenced in that area, and it is further appropriate to distinguish areas of higher and lower epidemiological risks respectively.\n(7) Technical amendments should also be introduced to facilitate movements of live animals inside the territory of the same Member State, in particular for immediate slaughter.\n(8) For the sake of clarity it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2001/783/EC and to replace it by the present Decision.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Decision is to establish restricted zones to prevent the extension of bluetongue (BT), comprising protection and surveillance zones in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2000/75/EC, and to lay down rules on movements in and from those zones of animals of species susceptible to bluetongue.", "Movement restrictions\nThe dispatch and transit of live animals of species susceptible to bluetongue and their sperm, ova and embryos, are prohibited:\n- from or through the territory corresponding to the administrative units listed in Annex IA,\n- from or through the territory corresponding to the administrative units listed in Annex IB,\n- from or through the territory corresponding to the administrative units listed in Annex IC section 1,\n- from or through the territory corresponding to the administrative units listed in Annex IC section 2.", "Exemptions for trade\n1.
