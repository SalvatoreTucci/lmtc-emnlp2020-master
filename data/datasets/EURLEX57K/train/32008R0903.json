In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(5) provides that no refund is to be granted where the products are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the date on which the export declaration is accepted.\n(3) Such requirements have nevertheless proved insufficient to ensure that uniform conditions apply when refunds are paid on some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(q) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(4) Additional conditions relating to products of average quality and enabling the payment of refunds on products of inferior quality to be refused should consequently be laid down at Community level.\n(5) Provision should be made for an additional quality in the case of products falling within CN codes 1601\u00a000\u00a099 and 1602\u00a049\u00a019, not containing poultrymeat and for which the quality criteria should be set high in order to limit any refunds granted to such products where the quantities covered by export licence applications exceed or are likely to exceed traditional quantities.\n(6) It is essential to make provision for checks to ensure compliance with this Regulation. Such checks are to be conducted pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002 of 26 November 2002 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 as regards physical checks carried out when agricultural products qualifying for refunds are exported\u00a0(6), and must in particular include an organoleptic examination and physical and chemical analyses. Applications for refunds must accordingly be accompanied by a written declaration to the effect that the products in question meet the requirements laid down herein.\n(7) Provision must be made for certain clearly defined analyses with a view to ensuring standardisation of the physical and chemical checks.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to other Community provisions and in particular Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, export refunds shall only be granted on the products listed in Annex I hereto where:\n(a) they meet the conditions laid down in Annex I hereto;
