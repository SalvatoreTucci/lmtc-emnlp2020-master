Here the intention is to ensure that only essentials are maintained and the pits remain viable until the coalfield can be closed down without friction, so that serious economic and social upheaval is avoided; the last pit of production has been closed definitively on 30 September 1984;\nWhereas the purpose and type of the aids to cover pit operating losses of the Southern coalfield are therefore compatible with the first subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (2) of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 3 (2) of the Decision, all other measures to assist current production in 1984 must be taken into consideration for an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas, on this basis of assessment, the total amount of aid proposed is 212 400 000 ECU, i.e. 35,40 ECU per tonne; whereas this figure compared with 1983 (26,37 ECU per tonne) shows that there is an augmentation of nearly 35 %;\nWhereas the following observations can be made on the compatibility of the proposed current production aids with the proper functioning of the common market:\n- there were no supply difficulties in 1984,\n- the closure of the last pit in the Southern coalfield resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest,\n- industrial consumers of coal did not receive aid in 1984 as a result of the prices of Belgian coking coal and steam coal;\nWhereas it may be concluded that the aid granted to the Belgian coal-mining industry in 1984 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to the coal mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC (1);\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the 1984 calendar year to grant aid totalling Bfrs 5 379 200 000 to the Belgian coal-mining industry.\nThe amount of Bfrs 5 379 200 000 provided in respect of the calendar year 1984 is divided as follows:\n1.
