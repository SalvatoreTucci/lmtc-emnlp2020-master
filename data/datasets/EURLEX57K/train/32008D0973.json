This date was chosen by reference to the end of the period where seed potatoes are placed on the market.\n(3) Since this work still has not been completed and as a new marketing season will start by the end of the year 2008, it is necessary to authorise Member States to extend the validity of their national equivalence decisions.\n(4) Directive 2002/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["In the first subparagraph of Article 21(3) of Directive 2002/56/EC, \u201831 March 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 March 2011\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 193, 20.7.2002, p. 60."}
