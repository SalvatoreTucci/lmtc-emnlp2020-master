However, by that date the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 will not have been achieved. An interruption of the application of the measures would cause serious harm to the stock of hake.\n(5) Therefore immediate action in conformity with conditions laid down in Article 45(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 is required to ensure that the measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 continue to apply until the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 is adopted by the Council.\n(6) Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 provides a derogation which is justified by the fact that the limit on the catches of hake would cause serious economic problems for small fishing vessels working on a daily basis. The derogation has negligible consequences regarding the conservation and recovery of the hake stock.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["This Regulation shall apply to fishing vessels operating within ICES subareas V and VII and ICES Divisions VIIb,c,f,g,h,j,k and ICES Divisions VIIIa,b,d,e.", "1.
