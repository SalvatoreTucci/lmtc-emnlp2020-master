The ability to use foreign languages is essential in order in practice fully to exercise that right.\n(3) Article 151 of the Treaty states that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity, and shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty. Among the cultural aspects, matters pertaining to languages are of great importance.\n(4) All the European languages, in their spoken and written forms, are equal in value and dignity from the cultural point of view and form an integral part of European cultures and civilisation.\n(5) The languages question is a challenge that must be tackled as part of the European integration process and the European Year of Languages may therefore prove to be highly instructive as far as the formulation of measures to encourage cultural and linguistic diversity is concerned.\n(6) Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n(7) Access to the vast literary heritage in the languages in which it was originally produced would contribute to developing mutual understanding and giving a tangible content to the concept of European citizenship.\n(8) It is important to learn languages as it enhances awareness of cultural diversity and helps eradicate xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance.\n(9) In addition to the human, cultural and political advantages, learning languages is also of considerable potential economic benefit.\n(10) A command of the respective mother tongue and knowledge of the classical languages, in particular Latin and Greek, can make it easier to learn other languages.\n(11) It is important to raise awareness among public and private decision-makers of the importance of easy access to language learning facilities.\n(12) The Council Conclusions of 12 June 1995 on linguistic diversity and multilingualism in the European Union emphasised that linguistic diversity must be preserved and multilingualism promoted in the Union, with equal respect for the languages of the Union and with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity. Decision No 2493/95/EC of the European Parliament and Council(5) of 23 October 1995 establishing 1996 as the \"European Year of Lifelong Learning\" highlighted the importance of the role of lifelong learning in developing competencies, including linguistic, throughout an individual's lifetime.\n(13) The Commission's 1995 White Paper \"Education, training, research: Teaching and learning: towards a learning society\" established as its Objective Four proficiency for all in three Community languages. The Commission's 1996 Green Paper \"Education, Training, Research: The obstacles to transnational mobility\" concluded that \"learning at least two Community languages has become a precondition if citizens of the European Union are to benefit from occupational and personal opportunities open to them in the single market\".\n(14) Council Resolution of 31 March 1995 on improving and diversifying language learning and teaching within the education systems of the European Union(6) states that pupils should as a general rule have the opportunity of learning two languages of the European Union other than their mother tongue(s) for a minimum of two consecutive years during compulsory schooling and if possible for a longer period.\n(15) The measures in the Lingua programme, adopted by Council Decision 89/489/EEC(7), were reinforced and partially integrated as horizontal measures into the Socrates programme adopted by Decision 819/95/EC of the European Parliament and the Council(8). Those measures have promoted the improvement of knowledge of the languages of the Union and have thus contributed to greater understanding and solidarity between the peoples of the Union. The European Parliament and Council in their Decision No 253/2000/EC(9) propose that those measures be further developed and reinforced in the second phase of the Socrates programme.\n(16) The Leonardo da Vinci programme, adopted by Decision 94/819/EC(10) of the European Parliament and the Council, has, building on the results achieved under the Lingua programme, supported activities aimed at developing linguistic skills as part of vocational training measures. That support will be further developed and reinforced in the second phase of the Leonardo da Vinci programme, adopted by Council Decision 1999/382/EC(11).\n(17) The Culture 2000 programme adopted by Decision No 508/2000/EC(12) also contributes to improving mutual understanding of the cultural achievements of the European peoples, especially by highlighting cultural diversity and multilingualism.\n(18) A multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society was established by Council Decision 96/664/EC(13).\n(19) The Report of the High Level Panel on the Free Movement of Persons presented to the Commission on 18 March 1997, considered \"the multiplicity of European languages [to be] ... a treasure to be safeguarded\" and suggested measures to foster language training and the use of languages in the Community.\n(20) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, inter alia because of the need for a coherent Community-wide information campaign avoiding duplication and achieving economies of scale. Those objectives can be better achieved by the Community, owing to the transnational dimension of Community actions and measures. This Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(21) However, it is also important that there should be close cooperation and coordination between the Commission and the Member States, so as to ensure that measures undertaken at European level are underpinned by small-scale measures undertaken at local, regional and national level which are likely to be more suited to the needs of target groups and specific situations, and that cultural diversity is strengthened as a result.\n(22) It is important to develop appropriate cooperation between the European Community and the Council of Europe so as to ensure consistency between measures undertaken at Community level and those undertaken by the Council of Europe, and such cooperation is expressly mentioned in Article 149 of the Treaty.\n(23) It is important to take into account the fact that the European Year of Languages will take place against the background of preparations for the enlargement of the Union.\n(24) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission(14), for the budgetary authority, during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(25) The Joint Declaration of 4 May 1999 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission(15) sets out the arrangements for the implementation of the co-decision procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty.\n(26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this decision should be adopted in accordance with the Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(16),", "main_body": ["Establishment of the European Year of Languages\n1.
