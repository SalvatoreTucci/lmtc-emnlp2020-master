whereas this has led to a drop in Community production of eels in general and particularly of fresh eels (live or dead), chilled or frozen, falling within subheading ex 03.01 A II of the Common Customs Tariff, intended for processing by curing or skinning enterprises or for use in the industrial manufacture of products falling within heading No 16.04 thereof; whereas this production is likely to be developed, particularly in two Member States, without, however, being able to satisfy all the requirements of the Community; whereas the processing industries in the Community consequently depend to a large extent on imports for their supplies of eels; whereas, from 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988 the application of the Common Customs Tariff duty should therefore be suspended totally on imports of the relevant products up to an appropriate quantitative limit; whereas the introduction of a Community measure of this nature is unlikely to harm Community production;\nWhereas current demand not met by Community production which must therefore be met by imports can be estimated at 5 250 tonnes for the period 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988; whereas a tariff quota for the relevant types of eel should therefore be opened for this period on the conditions set out above; whereas the fixing of the quota volume at this level does not, however, prevent its readjustment during the quota period;\nWhereas it is, in particular, necessary to ensure to all importers in the Member States equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, in the light of these principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the tariff quota among the Member States; whereas statistics available for these specific products do not give a clear picture of the market situation; whereas, therefore, it is not possible to allocate the quota among the Member States solely on the basis of import trends for the eels in question over the past few years; whereas, however, according to each Member State's estimated needs, initial shares may be fixed at the quantities set out in Article 2;\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first instalment being allocated, and the second forming a reserve intended subsequently to cover the requirements of the Member States which have used up their initial shares; whereas, in order to ensure a certain degree of security for importers, the first instalment of the Community tariff quota should be fixed at a level which, under present circumstances, may be around 80 % of the quota amount;\nWhereas the initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and to avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its total initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost entirely used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which must be able to keep account of the extent to which the quota amount has been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly; Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a considerable balance remains in one or other Member State, it is essential, to prevent a part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others, that that Member State should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
