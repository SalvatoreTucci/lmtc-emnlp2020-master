Rapeseed protein is intended to be used as a vegetable protein source in foods except in infant formulae and follow-on formulae. On 18 February 2014, the Commission was notified that Siebte PMI Verwaltungs GmbH had acquired the rights to the pending request.\n(2) On 17 September 2012, the competent food assessment body of Ireland issued its initial assessment report. In that report it came to the conclusion that rapeseed protein meets the criteria for novel food set out in Article\u00a03(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(3) On 4 October 2012, the Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to the other Member States.\n(4) Reasoned objections were raised within the 60-day period laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(5) On 14 February 2013, the Commission consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asking it to carry out an additional assessment for rapeseed protein as food ingredient in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a0258/97.\n(6) On 10 October 2013, in its \u2018Scientific Opinion on the safety of \u201crapeseed protein isolate\u201d as the Novel Food ingredient\u2019\u00a0(2), EFSA concluded that rapeseed protein is safe as a protein added to food. However, it also noted that the risk of sensitisation to rapeseed cannot be excluded and that it is likely that rapeseed can trigger allergic reactions in people allergic to mustard.\n(7) Therefore, the opinion gives sufficient grounds to establish that rapeseed protein as a novel food ingredient complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, provided that the labelling of foods containing rapeseed protein as a food ingredient is such to allow people who are allergic to mustard to avoid consumption of those foods.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Rapeseed protein specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient.", "The designation of rapeseed protein authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018rapeseed protein\u2019.", "The labelling of any foodstuff containing rapeseed protein shall bear an easily visible and legible statement that the product containing \u2018rapeseed protein\u2019 as a food ingredient may cause allergic reaction to consumers who are allergic to mustard and products thereof. Where relevant, this statement shall appear in close proximity to the list of ingredients.", "This Decision is addressed to Siebte PMI Verwaltungs GmbH, Neuer Jungfernstieg 5, 20354 Hamburg, Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 July 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a043, 14.2.1997, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(10):3420.\nANNEX\nSPECIFICATION OF RAPESEED PROTEIN\nDefinition\n: Rapeseed protein is an aqueous protein-rich extract from rapeseed press cake originating from non-genetically modified Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L.\nDescription\n: White to off-white, spray dried powder.\nPurity\n:\nTotal phytate Not more than 1,5 %\nLead Not more than 0,5\u00a0mg/kg\nMicrobiological criteria\n:\nYeast and mould count Not more than 100 cfu/g\nAerobic bacteria count Not more than 10\u00a0000 cfu/g\nTotal coliform count Not more than 10 cfu/g\nEscherichia coli Absent in 10 g\nSalmonella spp. Absent in 25 g"}
