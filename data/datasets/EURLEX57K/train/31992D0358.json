GENERAL REMARKS  This programme relates to the whole of the metropolitan French fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of metropolitan France.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet (defined as registered vessels other than those laid up for more than two years) to 197 572 GRT and 1 033 949 kW, in accordance with point II.3 below;\n(b) to stabilize the tuna freezer fleet at 27 142 GRT and 69 037 kW, on the understanding that if the fishing capacity of the freezer-seiners expanded beyond the objectives and limits laid down in the programme for this category, this shall not affect  the achievement of the overall objectives of the programme and provided that such expansion does not call for any Community financial assistance towards the utilization of the fishing capacities concerned, such expansion may not affect the reference  data to be taken into consideration by the Community for the purposes of establishing and conducting relations with third countries;\n(c) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong.\n2. To ensure a reduction in overall capacity, no capacity transfers may be made between the fleets operating in the Mediterranean, those operating in Community waters and those operating in other areas.\n3. During the period covered by the programme the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\n- vessels used solely for bivalve fishing,\nmust remain within the following limits:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nLess than 12 m overall\n31 019(  )*\n35 530(  )*\n31 295(  )*\n30 669 (\u00b2)\nBetween 12 m and 16 m overall\n19 277(  )*\n21 825(  )*\n20 750(  )*\n20 335 (\u00b2)\nBetween 16 m and 38 m overall\n71 385(  )*\n80 905(  )*\n78 259(  )*\n76 694 (\u00b2)\nMore than 38 m\n71 126(  )*\n71 300(  )*\n71 300(  )*\n69 874 (\u00b2)\nOf which:\n- ocean-going tuna fleet\n23 410(26)*\n27 142(30)*\n27 142(30)*\n27 142(30)*\n- others\n47 716(  )*\n44 158(  )*\n44 158 (\u00b9)\n42 732 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n192 807(  )*\n209 560(  )*\n184 495\n208 764\n204 786\n201 604(  )*\n197 572(  )*\nVessels for aquaculture or for\ncatching bivalves\nTotal B\n15 271(  )*\n(\u00b9) Including vessels in construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility may be allowed between one category of fishing vessel and another.\n* Number of vessels.\nEngine power  (in kW)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1992\nLess than 12 m overall\n309 278(  )*\n440 102(  )*\n378 405(  )*\n370 837 (\u00b2)\nBetween 12 m and 16 m overall\n119 383(  )*\n157 943(  )*\n143 370(  )*\n140 503 (\u00b2)\nBetween 16 m and 38 m overall\n318 999(  )*\n392 131(  )*\n364 875(  )*\n357 577 (\u00b2)\nMore than 38 m\n166 340(  )*\n168 400(  )*\n168 400(  )*\n165 032 (\u00b2)\nOf which:\n- ocean-going tuna fleet\n61 198(26)*\n69 037(30)*\n69 037(30)*\n69 037(30)*\n- others\n105 142(  )*\n99 363(  )*\n99 363 (\u00b9)\n95 995 (\u00b2)\nTotal A\n914 000(  )*\n1 158 576(  )*\n1 053 931\n1 148 223\n1 096 460\n1 055 050(  )*\n1 033 949(  )*\nVessels for aquaculture or for\ncatching bivalves\nTotal B\n117 421(  )*\n(\u00b9) Including vessels in construction at 1 January 1987.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility may be allowed between one category of fishing vessel and another.\n* Number of vessels.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives at point II.3, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992; account must also be taken of  changes, if any, in fishing capacity resulting from:\n- projects for new vessels Construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n- applications for Community financing of new vessel construction projects currently under consideration by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1992, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction  achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in point III.1.1 is reduced as planned:\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged, sunk or otherwise lost, in particular by laying up of operational vessels in direct relation to new constructions, in accordance with the attainment of the  objectives set out in point II.3,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reductions which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n- the adoption of administrative measures to forestall any increase in fishing capacity which would be contrary to the programme's objectives,\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results.\n(\u00b9) Overall capacity may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programme's objectives.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (\u00b9) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 1991."}
