These measures were treated as exceptional market support measures within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1499/2004\u00a0(2).\n(2) Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1499/2004 determines the period in which the eligible hatching eggs should have been processed. Close examination of the situation in April and May 2003 shows that it was not possible, for veterinary and health reasons, to observe that period.
