Where for those products no supplementary measurement unit is set out in the Combined Nomenclature laid down in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(2) there can be uncertainty in respect of the measurement unit used. For the sake of clarity and in the interest of a better quotas management it is therefore necessary to provide that, in order to benefit from the said autonomous tariff quotas, the exact quantity of the products imported must be entered in \u2018Box 41: Supplementary units\u2019 of the declaration for release for free circulation using the measurement unit of the quota amount set out for those products in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.\n(2) Community demand for the products to which Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 applies should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose with effect from 1 July 2009, three new Community tariff quotas should be opened at zero rates of duty for appropriate amounts while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for those products.\n(3) The quota amount for autonomous Community tariff quota with order No 09.2767 is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry. Consequently, this quota amount should be increased.\n(4) For the autonomous Community tariff quota with order No 09.2806 the product description should be revised.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community.\n(7) Since the tariff quotas have to take effect from 1 July 2009, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n2.
