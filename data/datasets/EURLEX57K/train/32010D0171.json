Those programmes comply with the requirements for approval laid down in Directive 2006/88/EC and Decision 2009/177/EC. Accordingly, they should be approved and included in the list in Part A of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC.\n(4) The whole territory of Ireland, except Cape Clear Island, is currently listed in Part C of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC as declared disease-free for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS). Ireland has notified to the Commission a declaration of freedom from that disease for Cape Clear Island. That declaration was added to the agenda of the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal health on 12 January 2010. The declaration complies with the requirements for a declaration of freedom of disease laid down in Directive 2006/88/EC and Decision 2009/177/EC. Accordingly, the whole territory of Ireland should be declared free of VHS. Part C of Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) Decision 2009/177/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2009/177/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0328, 24.11.2006, p.\u00a014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a063, 7.3.2009, p.\u00a015.\nANNEX\nAnnex I is amended as follows:\n1.
