A government may impose a levy on an entity. The IFRS Interpretations Committee received requests for guidance on the accounting for levies in the financial statements of the entity that is paying the levy. The question relates to when to recognise a liability to pay a levy that is accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\nSCOPE\n2. This Interpretation addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37. It also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain.\n3. This Interpretation does not address the accounting for the costs that arise from recognising a liability to pay a levy. Entities should apply other Standards to decide whether the recognition of a liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense.\n4. For the purposes of this Interpretation, a levy is an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that is imposed by governments on entities in accordance with legislation (i.e. laws and/or regulations), other than:\n(a) those outflows of resources that are within the scope of other Standards (such as income taxes that are within the scope of IAS 12 Income Taxes); and\n(b) fines or other penalties that are imposed for breaches of the legislation.\n5. A payment made by an entity for the acquisition of an asset, or for the rendering of services under a contractual agreement with a government, does not meet the definition of a levy.\n6. An entity is not required to apply this Interpretation to liabilities that arise from emissions trading schemes.\nISSUES\n7. To clarify the accounting for a liability to pay a levy, this Interpretation addresses the following issues:\n(a) what is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy?\n(b) does economic compulsion to continue to operate in a future period create a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in that future period?\n(c) does the going concern assumption imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period?\n(d) does the recognition of a liability to pay a levy arise at a point in time or does it, in some circumstances, arise progressively over time?\n(e) what is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy that is triggered if a minimum threshold is reached?\n(f) are the principles for recognising in the annual financial statements and in the interim financial report a liability to pay a levy the same?\nCONSENSUS\n8. The obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation. For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy is the generation of revenue in the current period and the calculation of that levy is based on the revenue that was generated in a previous period, the obligating event for that levy is the generation of revenue in the current period. The generation of revenue in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation.\n9. An entity does not have a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period as a result of the entity being economically compelled to continue to operate in that future period.\n10. The preparation of financial statements under the going concern assumption does not imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period.\n11. The liability to pay a levy is recognised progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time (i.e. if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation, occurs over a period of time). For example, if the obligating event is the generation of revenue over a period of time, the corresponding liability is recognised as the entity generates that revenue.\n12. If an obligation to pay a levy is triggered when a minimum threshold is reached, the accounting for the liability that arises from that obligation shall be consistent with the principles established in paragraphs 8-14 of this Interpretation (in particular, paragraphs 8 and 11). For example, if the obligating event is the reaching of a minimum activity threshold (such as a minimum amount of revenue or sales generated or outputs produced), the corresponding liability is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.\n13. An entity shall apply the same recognition principles in the interim financial report that it applies in the annual financial statements. As a result, in the interim financial report, a liability to pay a levy:\n(a) shall not be recognised if there is no present obligation to pay the levy at the end of the interim reporting period; and\n(b) shall be recognised if a present obligation to pay the levy exists at the end of the interim reporting period.\n14. An entity shall recognise an asset if it has prepaid a levy but does not yet have a present obligation to pay that levy.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Reproduction allowed within the European Economic Area.
