LARDINOIS\nMember of the Commission  (1)OJ No L 170, 3.8.1970, p. 2. (2)OJ No L 73, 27.3.1972, p. 14.\nANNEX METHODS OF SAMPLING\n1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\nSamples intended for the official control of feedingstuffs, for quality and composition, shall be taken according to the methods described below. Samples thus obtained shall be considered as representative of the sampled portions.\n2. SAMPLING OFFICERS\nThe samples shall be taken by officers authorized for that purpose by the Member States.\n3. DEFINITIONS\nSampled portion : A quantity of product constituting a unit, and having characteristics presumed to be uniform.\nIncremental sample : A quantity taken from one point in the sampled portion.\nAggregate sample : An aggregate of incremental samples taken from the same sampled portion.\nReduced sample : A representative part of the aggregate sample, obtained from the latter by a process of reduction.\nFinal sample : A part of the reduced sample or of the homogenized aggregate sample.\n4. APPARATUS      4.1. The sampling apparatus must be made of materials which cannot contaminate the products to be sampled. Such apparatus may be officially approved by the Member States.\n4.2. Apparatus recommended for the sampling of solid feedingstuffs      4.2.1. Manual sampling        4.2.1.1. Flat-bottomed shovel with vertical sides.\n4.2.1.2. Sampling spear with a long split or compartments. The dimensions of the sampling spear must be appropriate to the characteristics of the sampled portion (depth of container, dimensions of sack, etc.) and to the particle size of the feedingstuff.\n4.2.2. Mechanical sampling\nApproved mechanical apparatus may be used for the sampling of moving feedingstuffs.\n4.2.3. Divider\nApparatus designed to divide the sample into approximately equal parts may be used for taking incremental samples and for the preparation of reduced and final samples.\n5. QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS  5.A. In relation to the control of substances or products uniformly distributed throughout the feedingstuff\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009121\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009122\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009123\">\n6. INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKING, PREPARING AND PACKAGING THE SAMPLES      6.1. General\nThe samples must be taken and prepared as quickly as possible bearing in mind the precautions necessary to ensure that the product is neither changed nor contaminated. Instruments and also surfaces and containers intended to receive samples must be clean and dry.\n6.2. Incremental samples  6.2.A. In relation to the control of substances or products uniformly distributed throughout the feedingstuff\nIncremental samples must be taken at random throughout the whole sampled portion and they must be of approximately equal sizes.  6.2.A.1. Loose feedingstuffs\nAn imaginary division shall be made of the sampled portion into a number of approximately equal parts. A number of parts corresponding to the number of incremental samples required in accordance with 5.A.2 shall be selected at random and at least one sample taken from each of these parts.\nWhere appropriate, sampling may be carried out when the sampled portion is being moved (loading or unloading).\n6.2.A.2. Packaged feedingstuffs\nHaving selected the required number of packages for sampling as indicated in 5.A.2, part of the contents of each package shall be removed using a spear or shovel. Where necessary, the samples shall be taken after emptying the packages separately.\n6.2.A.3. Homogeneous or homogenizable liquid or semi-liquid feedingstuffs\nHaving selected the required number of containers for sampling as indicated in 5.A.2, the contents shall be homogenized if necessary and an amount taken from each container.\nThe incremental samples may be taken when the contents are being discharged.\n6.2.A.4. Non-homogenizable, liquid or semi-liquid feedingstuffs\nHaving selected the required number of containers for sampling as indicated in 5.A.2, samples shall be taken from different levels.\nSamples may also be taken when the contents are being discharged but the first fractions should be discarded:\nIn either case the total volume taken must not be less than 10 litres.\n6.2.A.5. Feed blocks and mineral licks\nHaving selected the required number of blocks or licks for sampling as indicated in 5.A.2, a part of each block or lick shall be taken.\n6.2.B. In relation to the control of undesirable substances or products likely to be distributed non-uniformly throughout the feedingstuff, such as aflatoxins, rye ergot, castor-oil plant and crotalaria in straight feedingstuffs\nAn imaginary division shall be made of the sampled portion into a number of approximately equal parts, corresponding to the number of aggregate samples provided for in 5.B.3. If this number is greater than one, the total number of incremental samples provided for in 5.B.2 shall be distributed approximately equally over the different parts. Then take samples of approximately equal sizes (d) and such that the total amount in the samples from each part is not less than the minimum 4 kg quantity required for each aggregate sample. Incremental samples taken from different parts shall not be aggregated.\n6.3. Preparation of aggregate samples  6.3.A. in relation to the control of substances of products distributed uniformly throughout the feedingstuff\nThe incremental samples shall be mixed to form a single aggregate sample.\n6.3.B. In relation to the control of undesirable substances or products likely to be distributed non-uniformly throughout the feedingstuff, such as aflatoxins, rye ergot, castor-oil plant and crotalaria in straight feedingstuffs\nThe incremental samples from each part of the sampled portion shall be mixed and the number of aggregate samples provided for in 5. B. 3, made up taking care to note the origin of each aggregate sample.\n6.4. Preparation of final samples\nThe material in each aggregate sample shall be carefully mixed to obtain an homogenized sample (e). If necessary the aggregate sample should first be reduced to at least 2 kg or two litres (reduced sample) either by using a mechanical divider or by the quartering method.\nAt least three final samples shall then be prepared, of approximately the same amount and conforming to the quantitative requirements of 5.A.4 or 5.B.4. Each sample shall be put into an appropriate container. All necessary precautions shall be taken to avoid any change of composition of the sample, contamination or adulteration which might arise during transportation or storage.\n(d) For packaged feedingstuffs, a part of the contents of the packages to be sampled shall be removed, using a spear or shovel, after having, if necessary, emptied the packages separately.   (e) Any lumps shall be broken up (if necessary by separating them out and returning them to the sample) in each aggregate sample separately.       6.5. Packaging of final samples\nThe containers of packages shall be sealed and labelled (the total label must be incorporated in the seal) in such a manner that they cannot be opened without damaging the seal.\n7. SAMPLING RECORD\nA record must be kept of each sampling, permitting each sampled portion to be identified unambiguously.\n8. DESTINATION OF SAMPLES\nFor each aggregate sample, at least one final sample shall be sent as quickly as possible to the authorized analytical laboratory, together with the information necessary for the analyst."}
