It also allows the United Kingdom not to treat as supplies of services for consideration the private use of a car hired or leased by a taxable person for business purposes. The derogation removes the need for the hirer/lessee to keep records of private mileage travelled in business cars and to account for tax on the actual private mileage of each car. It is therefore a simplification measure but also limits the scope for abuse through incorrect record keeping.\n(5) The legal and factual circumstances which justified granting authorisation to apply the original derogation have not changed and are therefore still relevant.\n(6) In the light of Commission proposals to amend Directive 77/388/EEC with regard to restrictions on the right to deduct VAT, it is appropriate to extend the period of the authorisation until such relevant amendments come into force. However, this authorisation will expire on 31 December 2007 at the latest if no such amendments have entered into force by that date, enabling an assessment to be made at that time of the necessity for a derogation in the light of further discussions of the proposals held in the Council.\n(7) An extension will have no impact on the European Communities' own resources accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Decision 98/198/EC shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 3\nThis authorisation shall expire on the date of entry into force of Community rules determining what expenditure relating to motorised road vehicles is not to be eligible for full deduction of value added tax, but on 31 December 2007 at the latest.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
