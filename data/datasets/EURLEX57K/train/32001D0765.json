Furthermore, reproductive material should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question.\n(6) Any Member State should furthermore be authorised to permit, in its territory, the following three marketing operations: the marketing of seed and seedlings which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of provenance; the marketing of seed and seedlings which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of the category, as laid down in Directive 66/404/EEC for Populus nigra; and the marketing of seed which satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of specific purity as laid down in Directive 71/161/EEC, if the marketing of such material has been authorised in the other Member States under this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.
