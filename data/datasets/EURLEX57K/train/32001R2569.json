The amount of such financial compensation should be reduced by standard values in the case of products intended for purposes other than human consumption.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83 of 9 June 1983 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been withdrawn from the market(3) specifies the ways of disposing of the products withdrawn. The value of such products should be fixed at a standard level for each of these modes of disposal, taking into account the average revenues which may be obtained from such disposal in the various Member States.\n(3) Under Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 of 15 November 2000 setting detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards financial compensation on certain fishery products(4), special rules provide that, where a producer organisation or one of its members puts its products up for sale in a Member State other than the country in which it is recognised, the body responsible for granting the financial compensation must be informed. This body is the one in the Member State in which the producer organisation is recognised. The standard value deductible should therefore be the value applied in that Member State.\n(4) The same method of calculation should be applied to advances on financial compensation as provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["For the 2002 fishing year, the standard values to be used in calculating financial compensation and associated advances for products withdrawn from the market by producer organisations, intended for purposes other than human consumption, are hereby fixed as set out in the Annex hereto for each of the uses shown.", "The standard value to be deducted from financial compensation and associated advances shall be that applied in the Member State in which the producer organisation is recognised.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 17, 21.1.2000, p. 22.\n(2) OJ L 132, 15.5.2001, p. 10.\n(3) OJ L 152, 10.6.1983, p. 22.\n(4) OJ L 289, 16.11.2000, p. 11.\nANNEX\n>TABLE>"}
