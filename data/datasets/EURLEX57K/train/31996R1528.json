Paddy rice with a miscellaneous impurities content in excess of 0,1 % may be bought into intervention only if an intervention price reduction of 0,02 % is applied for each additional 0,01 % ('miscellaneous impurities` means extraneous matter consisting of inedible vegetable or mineral material which is non-toxic and edible extraneous grains or parts of grains).", "1.

Such costs shall be determined by the intervention agency.\n3. If the intervention agency takes over the paddy rice elsewhere than at the marketing centre indicated by the seller or the place where the paddy rice is when the offer is made, the cost of transport from the place where the paddy rice is to the place where it is taken over shall be borne by the intervention agency. In such case the price to be paid to the seller shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 2.", "1. The date of taking over by the intervention agency shall be set by the intervention agency. However, the actual taking over must take place not later than the end of the second month following receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August of the current marketing year, save in the event of force majeure.\n2.

The rice offered shall be taken over by the intervention agency where the minimum quantity and characteristics laid down in the Articles 1 and 2 have been established by the intervention agency or its authorized agent for the entire lot.\n4. The quality characteristics shall be established on the basis of a representative sample of the lot offered, consisting of samples taken at the rate of once every delivery for at least every 10 tonnes.\n5. The intervention agency shall have the physical characteristics of the samples taken analyzed.\nIf the analyses show that the rice offered does not correspond to the minimum quality required for intervention, the said rice shall be withdrawn at the applicant's expense. In such case the storage costs shall be borne by the applicant once the analyses have been notified to him, save where he is the successful party under the procedure provided for in paragraph 6 of this Article.\n6. If no agreement can be reached concerning the quality and the characteristics of the paddy rice offered, samples taken by both parties shall be analyzed by a laboratory approved by the competent authorities. The results of such analysis shall be final and the costs borne by the losing party.\n7. A take-over record shall be drawn up by the intervention agency for each lot. It shall indicate:\n- the date on which the quantity and minimum characteristics are checked,\n- the weight delivered,\n- the number of samples taken to make up the representative sample,\n- the physical characteristics found.\n8.
