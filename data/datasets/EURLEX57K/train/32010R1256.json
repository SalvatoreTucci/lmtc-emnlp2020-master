Fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative stability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the common fisheries policy established in Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n(4) The total allowable catch (TAC) should be established on the basis of the available scientific advice and by taking into account the biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders.\n(5) The use of fishing opportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy\u00a0(2) and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify codes to be used by the Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas\u00a0(3), the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein are to be identified.\n(7) In order to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2011.
