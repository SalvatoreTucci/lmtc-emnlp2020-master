Under Article 19(4) thereof, Annex XIIa of that Regulation lists the cases where the Member States may authorise an increase in the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre because of weather conditions.\n(3) By letter of 12 January 2007, the German Government requested authorisation to increase the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre for wine produced in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hessen and Rhineland-Palatinate from the 2006 grape harvest in the wake of exceptionally unfavourable weather conditions. That request should be acceded to.\n(4) The scientific reports provided by the competent German authorities show that the quantities of sulphur dioxide needed to ensure the proper vinification and proper preservation of the wines and that they are suitable for placing on the market should be increased above the level normally authorised. This temporary measure is the only available option to allow the grapes affected by these unfavourable weather conditions to be used to produce wine suitable for placing on the market.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Annex XIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is hereby replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
