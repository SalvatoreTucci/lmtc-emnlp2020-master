zones.\n(10) No further cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been observed throughout the country, the last vaccination was carried out in May 2001, all vaccinated animals have been identified and intensive surveillance including serological surveillance is being carried out with negative results for foot-and-mouth disease.\n(11) The Swaziland authorities have given the necessary guarantees to the Commission that the territory excluding the area west of the \"red line\" fences which extend northwards from the river Usutu to the frontier with South Africa west of Nkalashane may again be
