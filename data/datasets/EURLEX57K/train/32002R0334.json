The specifications set out in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) document 9303 on machine readable visas will be taken into account.\n(7) Common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas are essential to meet high technical standards and to facilitate detection of forged or falsified visa stickers.\n(8) The powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Committee set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 which should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should therefore be amended.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation to make the uniform format for visas more secure do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.\n(11) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.\n(12) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(5).\n(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 4 December 2001, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(14) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation.
