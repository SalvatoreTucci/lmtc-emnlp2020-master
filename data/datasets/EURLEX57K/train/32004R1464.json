The narasin product, Monteban, is an additive belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\u2019 listed in Chapter I of Annex B to Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(2) The person responsible for putting into circulation Monteban submitted an application for authorisation and a dossier, according to Article 9g(2) and (4) of that Directive.\n(3) Article 9g(6) of Directive 70/524/EEC allows the automatic extension of the period of authorisation of the additives concerned until the Commission takes a decision in cases where, for reasons beyond the control of the authorisation holder, no decision may be taken on the application before the expiry date of the authorisation. This provision is applicable to the authorisation of Monteban. The Commission requested a full risk evaluation from the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on 26 April 2001 and this request was consequently transferred to the European Food Safety Authority. Several requests for additional information were made during the re-evaluation process, making it impossible to complete the re-evaluation within the time limits required by Article 9g.\n(4) The Scientific Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed attached to the European Food Safety Authority has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety and to the efficacy of Monteban for chickens for fattening.\n(5) The re-evaluation of Monteban carried out by the Commission showed that the relevant conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC are satisfied. Monteban should therefore be authorised for 10 years as an additive linked to the person responsible for putting it into circulation and included in Chapter I of the list referred to Article 9t(b) of that Directive.\n(6) As the authorisation for the additive is now linked to a person responsible for putting it into circulation, and replaces the previous authorisation which was not linked to any specific person, it is appropriate to delete the latter authorisation.\n(7) Since there are no safety reasons for withdrawing the product narasin from the market immediately, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period of six months for the disposal of existing stocks of the additive.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Chapter I of Annex B to Directive 70/524/EEC is amended as follows:\nthe additive narasin, belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostats and other medical substances\u2019, is deleted.", "The additive Monteban belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostats and other medical substances\u2019, as set out in the Annex to the present Regulation, is authorised for use in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "A period of six months from the date of entry into force of this Regulation is permitted to use up the existing stocks of narasin.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
