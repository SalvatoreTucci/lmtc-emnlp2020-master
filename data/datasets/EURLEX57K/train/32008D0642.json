The Argentinean territory of Patagonia south of the 42nd parallel is recognised as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination status. Imports into the Community of bone-in fresh meat from certain animals are authorised from that territory. The other territories of Argentina are recognised as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination status and only imports of de-boned and matured fresh meat from those territories into the Community are authorised.\n(3) In 2007, a territory in Argentina north of the 42nd parallel corresponding to parts of the provinces of Neuqu\u00e9n and Rio Negro was recognised as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination status by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n(4) Following that recognition, Argentina requested that imports into the Community of bone-in fresh meat from that territory be authorised. In February 2008, a Community inspection was carried out in Argentina to verify the situation on the ground. As the outcome of that mission was favourable, it is appropriate to authorise imports into the Community of bone-in fresh meat from certain animals from that territory.\n(5) Several Community inspections have been recently carried out in Brazil, including in the states of Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo. As a result of those inspections, Decision 79/542/EEC, as amended by Decision 2008/61/EC, lays down import measures strengthening the control and surveillance of holdings from which animals eligible for export to the Community are sourced, in order to authorise imports of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat only from animals from specifically approved farms located in states which are recognised as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease status with or without vaccination.\n(6) In May 2008, the status of free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination was reinstated by the OIE for certain Brazilian States, including Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo.\n(7) Considering the free of foot-and-mouth disease status of those states, and considering the results of the inspections carried out in Brazil, these states should be re-included in the list of territories from which imports into the Community of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat are authorised under the uniform conditions applicable to the other Brazilian States free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination and currently authorised for such imports into the Community.\n(8) In 2007, Paraguay was recognised by the OIE as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination status with the exception of a high surveillance area along its external borders. In April 2008, a Community inspection took place in Paraguay in order to verify the situation on the ground.\n(9) The favourable outcome of that inspection suggests that it is appropriate to authorise imports into the Community of de-boned and matured fresh bovine meat from the territory of Paraguay which is recognised by the OIE as having a free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination status.\n(10) Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1\u00a0August 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0146, 14.6.1979, p.\u00a015.
