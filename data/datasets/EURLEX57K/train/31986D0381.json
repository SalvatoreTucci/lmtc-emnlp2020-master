Purpose of the programme\nDevelopment of the processing and marketing of fish and fish products, including freshwater species.\n2. Delimitation of the area concerned by the programme\nThe four coastal 'Laender' of Germany, i.e. Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg and Bremen.\n3. Duration of the programme\nThe programme covers the period 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1989.\n4. Objectives of the programme\nWithin the general framework of adapting the processing and marketing facilities to changes in the industry as regards the supply of basic raw material, the aims of the restructuring are:\n- the introduction of new processing and storage techniques,\n- the improvement and rationalization of the infrastructure for the processing and marketing of fish products,\n- improvements in hygiene and quality,\n- energy saving and environmental protection,\n- the creation of efficient production units by merging smaller units into large ones.\n5. Investment forecasts\nThe total amount of investment for the duration of the programme is 40 million DM (18,5 million ECU) to attain the foreseen objectives.\nThe national aid for the duration of the programme is scheduled at 3,2 million DM (1,5 million ECU), attributed in approximately equal proportions.\nWith regard to the abovementioned actions, the scheduled investment can be broken down as:\n1.2 // - investment in new packing and processing facilities  // 8 million DM,   // - investment to adapt to the new raw material situation   // 4 million DM,   // - investment in infrastructure   // 6 million DM,   // - investment in the improvement of quality and new products   // 10 million DM,  // - investment in rationalization   // 12 million DM.\nThe financial data as well as the breakdown between various types of investments are indicative.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by Germany as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis, to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of resources and of the conseqences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n2. Given that the structural measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture foreseen for 1987 and later may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for the processing and marketing of fish products.\n3. Furthermore, the investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n4. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product.\n5. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in this programme do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community."}
