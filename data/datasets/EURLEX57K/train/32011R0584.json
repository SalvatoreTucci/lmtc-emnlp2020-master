In its letter dated 6 April 2010, the Commission invited the interested parties to hold appropriate consultations.\n(4) Given that an agreement was reached within 6 months including minor amendments to the specification, the Commission must now issue a decision.\n(5) In the light of the above, the amendments should be approved and the amended single document should be published,", "main_body": ["The amendments to the specification presented in Annex 2 concerning the name in Annex 1 to this Regulation are hereby approved.", "The amended single document in Annex 2 to this Regulation shall be applied.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 June 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 21.6.1996, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 199, 25.8.2009, p. 24.\nANNEX I\nAgricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty:\nClass 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cheeses\nITALY\nGrana Padano (PDO)\nANNEX II\nSINGLE DOCUMENT\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 510/2006\n\u2018GRANA PADANO\u2019\nEC No: IT-PDO-0217-0011-26.7.2006\nPGI ( ) PDO (X)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Grana Padano\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State or third country\nItaly\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product (Annex III)\nClass 1.3 \u2013 Cheeses\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the product to which the name in point 1 applies\nHard cheese made from cooked paste; it is matured slowly, manufactured throughout the year and used whole or grated; it is produced from raw, partially skimmed milk from cows, milked twice a day, whose basic diet consists of fresh or dried fodder; milk used may come from one milking or from two milkings mixed together. The cheese is cylindrical in form with a slightly convex or virtually straight heel, and with flat faces featuring a slightly raised edge.\nIt has a diameter of 35 to 45\u00a0cm and the heel is 18 to 25\u00a0cm high, depending on technical production conditions.\nWeight: from 24 to 40\u00a0kg; rind: hard and smooth, 4-8\u00a0mm thick.\nThe paste is hard, with a finely grained structure, flaky from the middle out and with barely visible eyes. The minimum fat content of the dry matter is 32\u00a0%. The colour of the rind is dark or a natural golden yellow and the paste is white or straw-coloured. The paste has a fragrant aroma and a delicate taste.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nRaw cow\u2019s milk, natural whey and calf rennet.\nThe milk comes from cows reared in the geographical area defined in point 4.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nThe basic feed for the dairy cattle, consisting of green or preserved fodder, is fed to lactating cows, dry cows and heifers over 7 months old.\nMilk cows are fed primarily with feed produced on the home farm or in the \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 production area.\nNo less than 50\u00a0% of the dry matter of the daily ration must be made up of feed with a ratio of fodder to feed of no less than 1, by reference to the dry matter.\nAt least 75\u00a0% of the dry matter of the fodder in the daily ration should come from feed produced in the production area of the milk.\nThe authorised feeds are listed in a positive list which includes:\n\u2014 fodder: fresh fodder, hay, straw, silage (not permitted for \u2018Trentingrana\u2019 production),\n\u2014 raw materials for feed, by category, which may be added to the fodder: cereals and their derivatives, oil seeds and their derivatives, tubers and root vegetables and products derived from them, dehydrated fodder, derivatives of the sugar industry, legume seeds, fats, minerals, additives.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe production and maturing operations must take place on the territory of the production area defined in point 4.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nGrating and related packaging must take place within the production area defined in point 4 since fresh grated cheese is a highly sensitive product and the preservation of its organoleptic characteristics requires it to be packaged immediately in conditions such as to avoid any drying out; furthermore, immediate packaging in packs bearing the designation of origin is more likely to ensure the authenticity of the grated product, which by nature is more difficult to identify than a whole cheese (as confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-469/00).\nThe use, for the production of grated \u2018Grana Padano\u2019, of cheese left over from the cutting and packaging of \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 marketed in pieces of varying and/or fixed weight, as blocks, cubes, bite-sized pieces, etc., is permitted only under the following conditions: the maximum proportion of rind must be 18\u00a0%; traceability of the whole \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 cheese from which the leftover cheese comes must be ensured at all times; where leftover cheese is to be used later and/or transferred from one establishment to another, it must be sorted by registration number and month of production; it may be transferred only within the same farm or between farms of the same group and only within the area of origin. The marketing of leftover cheese for the production of grated \u2018Grana Padano\u2019 is therefore prohibited.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on labelling\nThe official mark attesting to the product having met the requirements justifying the use of the \u2018Grana Padano\u2019 Protected Designation of Origin, and which must therefore appear both on the whole wheel and on all the packaging of \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 cheese in portions and grated, consists of a rhomboid shape over which the words \u2018GRANA\u2019 and \u2018PADANO\u2019 are stamped in upper case letters. In the upper and lower corners of the rhomboid, which are rounded, are inscribed respectively the initials \u2018G\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019.\nThe marking bands which cold stamp the origin mark on the wheels at the moulding stage are made up of a number of rhomboidal diamond shapes which contain within them the alternating words \u2018GRANA\u2019 and \u2018PADANO\u2019, and bear the cheese manufacturer\u2019s identification references and the month and year of manufacture.\nOnly \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 produced in the Autonomous Province of Trento, made using milk from cows fed throughout the year with fodder which does not include silage of any kind, qualifies for use of the special \u2018Trentingrana\u2019 marking bands, consisting of a line of rhomboidal diamond shapes split by the word \u2018TRENTINO\u2019; in the centre, between the outlines of stylised mountains, the word \u2018TRENTINO\u2019 appears right way up and in vertical rotation.\nIdentification of origin is completed with the affixing of a casein nameplate bearing the words \u2018Grana Padano\u2019, the year of manufacture and an alphanumeric code which unambiguously identifies each cheese wheel.\n\u2018Grana Padano\u2019 cheese which has been matured for at least 20 months after being moulded \u2013 within the production area \u2013 may be described as \u2018RISERVA\u2019. Classification in the category \u2018Grana Padano RISERVA\u2019 is shown by a second brand, affixed to the heel of the cheese at the request of the operators, in accordance with the same rules governing the affixing of the PDO mark. The mark in question is composed of a circle with the word \u2018RISERVA\u2019 written across the centre. In the upper half are written the word \u2018OLTRE\u2019 [more than] and the number \u201820\u2019, and in the lower half appears the word \u2018MESI\u2019 [months].\nThe following additional categories are applicable in the case of packaged products: \u2018Grana Padano OLTRE 16 MESI\u2019 and \u2018Grana Padano RISERVA\u2019.\nOn the packaging containing cheese of the category \u2018Grana Padano OLTRE 16 MESI\u2019, the \u2018Grana Padano\u2019 logo also bears the words \u2018OLTRE 16 MESI\u2019 on a single line between two parallel lines.\nOn the packaging containing cheese of the category \u2018Grana Padano RISERVA\u2019, the brand RISERVA appears in addition to the \u2018Grana Padano\u2019 logo.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area for \u2018Grana Padano\u2019, whole or grated, consists of the territory of the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Biella, Cuneo, Novara, Turin, Verbania, Vercelli, Bergamo, Brescia, Como, Cremona, Lecco, Lodi, Mantova on the left bank of the Po, Milan, Monza, Pavia, Sondrio, Varese, Trento, Padua, Rovigo, Treviso, Venice, Verona, Vicenza, Bologna on the right bank of the Reno, Ferrare, Forl\u00ec Cesena, Piacenza, Ravenna and Rimini, as well as the following municipalities in the province of Bolzano: Anterivo, Lauregno, Proves, Senale-San Felice and Trodena.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe production area for \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 is largely contiguous with the region of the Po plain, that is to say the geographical area of the Po river plain, characterised by fairly flat water meadows with alluvial soil of fluvial-glacial origin and well supplied with water, which is one of the most fertile areas of the world and among the best suited for growing fodder.\nIn particular, these soil characteristics, together with the area\u2019s microclimate, favour the production of maize, which represents the greatest proportion of the fodder for the cows whose milk is intended for \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019, since it can make up up to 50\u00a0% of the dry matter ingested.\nThe reclamation and irrigation of the Po plain since the 11th century has given rise to the local development of cattle rearing. The resulting availability of substantial quantities of milk which was surplus to the daily needs of the rural population prompted the need to transform it into a durable cheese. Even today, the large supply of local fodder, in particular maize, linked to the vast supply of water, is an essential element for maintaining cattle rearing and milk production.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe specificity of \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 may be ascribed to the following elements:\n\u2014 size and weight of the cheese,\n\u2014 particular morphology of the paste, linked to the production technique, characterised by a granular texture which gives rise to its typical flakiness,\n\u2014 white or straw colour, with a delicate flavour and fragrant aroma, due essentially to the widespread use of waxy corn in the fodder fed to the cattle,\n\u2014 water and fat content largely similar to the protein content,\n\u2014 high level of natural breakdown of the proteins in peptones, peptides and free amino acids,\n\u2014 resistance to lengthy ripening, even beyond 20 months.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe causal link between \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 and its area of origin may be traced to the following factors.\n\u2014 The high irrigation potential of the Po plain and the resulting availability of fodder, including mainly waxy corn, which is responsible for the specific characteristics of the white or straw colour, flavour and aroma of the paste as set out in point 5.2.\n\u2014 Indeed, the direct result of using corn or waxy corn silage is the inclusion in the cows\u2019 diet of fewer colorants such as carotene, anthocyanins and chlorophyll than if using a feed based on straw of various kinds or green fodder essences. This is a direct effect of storage in silos.\n\u2014 The use of raw milk, which has the effect of including in the process of cheese-making lactic bacteria typical of the area.\n\u2014 The use of natural whey, which creates an unbroken microbiological link with the production area. In fact, the milk, which turns to whey and thus to natural whey inoculum, is the link in the chain joining the cheese-making process to the production area and also ensures the continued and constant inclusion of lactic bacteria typical of the area of origin, to which are due the main special characteristics of \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 cheese.\nThe causal link between the characteristics of the product and its area of origin is also provided by the \u2018casaro\u2019 (cheesemaker) who has since time immemorial been of central and fundamental importance in the manufacture of \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019.\nEven today, the task of transforming milk into \u2018Grana Padano PDO\u2019 is entrusted to cheesemakers rather than to technicians or scientists.\nReference to publication of the specification\nThe Government has launched the national objection procedure in respect of the proposal to amend the \u2018Grana Padano\u2019 protected designation of origin.\nThe full text of the product specification is available:\n\u2014 at the following site:\n\u2014 by going direct to the home page of the Ministry (www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (upper right-hand corner of the screen) and finally on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE [regolamento CE n. 510/2006]\u2019."}
