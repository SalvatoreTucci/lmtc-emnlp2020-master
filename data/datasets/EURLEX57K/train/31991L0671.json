This Directive shall apply to all motor vehicles in categories  M1, M2 (except for rear seats and vehicles of a maximum permissible weight exceeding 3,5 tonnes and  those which include places specially designed for standing passengers) and N1 (except for rear  seats), as defined in Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC (1), intended for use on the road, having at  least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h.\n2.  for the purposes of this Directive:\n1. 'safety belt (seat belt, belt)` means an assembly of straps with a securing buckle, adjusting  devices and attachments which is capable of being anchored inside a power-driven vehicle and is  designed to diminish the risk of injury to its wearer, in the event of collision or of abrupt  vehicle deceleration, by limiting the mobility of the wearer's body. Such an assembly is generally  referred to as a 'belt assembly`, a term also embracing any devices for energy absorption or belt  retraction;\n2. 'restraint system` means a system combining a seat, fixed to the structure of the vehicle by  appropriate means and a safety belt for which at least one anchorage point is located on the seat  structure;\n3.

Member States shall also, on their territory and under conditions specified in their national  law, allow that children under three years of age occupying rear seats need not be restrained by a  restraint system suitable for their height and weight if such children are transported in a vehicle  where such a system is unavailable.", "Persons provided by the competent authorities with an exemption certificate for serious  medical reasons shall be exempt from the obligations laid down in Article 2. Any medical  certificate issued by the competent authorities in one Member State shall also be valid in any  other Member State; the medical certificate must indicate its period of validity and be shown to  all authorized persons upon request in accordance with the relevant provisions in force in each  Member State.
