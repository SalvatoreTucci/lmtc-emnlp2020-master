The Council and the European Parliament shall be informed of the results of the review.", "1. With regard to the concerted actions, the participating Member States and the Community shall, in accordance with a procedure to be laid down by the Commission, after having consulted the Committee referred to in Article 3, regularly exchange all useful information concerning the execution of the research covered by such activities.\nThe participating Member States shall provide the Commission with all information relevant for coordination purposes. They shall also endeavour to provide the Commission with information on similar research planned or carried out by bodies which are not under their authority. Any such information shall be treated as confidential if so requested by the Member State which provides it.\n2. Following completion of the programmes, the Commission shall, after having consulted the Committee referred to in Article 3, send to the Member States and the European Parliament a summary report on the implementation and results of the concerted actions.\nIt shall publish the report referred to in the first subparagraph six months after it has been sent to the Member States, unless a Member State objects. Should a Member State object, the report shall be distributed, in agreement with the Committee referred to in Article 3, only to those institutions and undertakings that request it and whose research or production activities justify access to the results of the research arising from the concerted actions. The Commission shall make the necessary arrangements for the report to remain confidential and not to be divulged to third parties.", "1. In accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty, the Council may conclude agreements with third States, in particular those involved in European cooperation in the field of scientific and technical research (COST), with a view to associating them wholly or partly with these programmes.\n2.
