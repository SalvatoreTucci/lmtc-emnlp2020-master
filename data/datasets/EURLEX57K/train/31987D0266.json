The said examination is a pre-condition of such employment.\nThe health check, on the basis of which the risk of contamination through the person concerned is assessed, must include an inquiry into the medical history carried out by means of a questionnaire (see under E), which must be assessed by a doctor, and a general medical examination carried out by a medical doctor.\nSuch medical examination may, if the doctor concerned considers it necessary, include a number of tests.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Annual) routine examination\nWhenever the medical authorities service concerned (attached to an undertaking) considers it necessary, in particular when suspicion exists in relation to the diseases listed in the questionnaires under E and F, but at least once a year, the health of the staff referred to in A must be assessed by means of a questionnaire (see under F).\nThe questionnaire, when completed by the personnel, is to be submitted to the medical authorities concerned. The doctor in charge has to sign this declaration, thus prolonging the medical certificate for one year. If the medical doctor, on the basis of the questionnaire or on the basis of any other information considers that there is a need for further medical assessment, a possible prolongation of the medical certificate can only be made after the results of such an assessment have been made available. Such an assessment may, if the doctor concerned considers it necessary, include a number of tests.\nWhere there is justification on epidemiological or clinical grounds, the medical service (attached to an undertaking) ensures that persons who are a possible source of contamination are prohibited from working or handling fresh meat, poultrymeat or meat products.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guidance in matters of hygiene\nAnyone working with or handling fresh meat, poultrymeat or meat products must have undergone appropriate training, particularly as regards his/her responsibility in matters of food and personal hygiene.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further comments\nAlthough a health certificate drawn up before taking up employment offers no absolute guarantee that the person concerned will not be a source of contamination, it is important, at the commencement of employment, to draw attention to essential public health aspects such as the responsibility in matters of hygiene generally and the obligation to report any contagious disease during the term of employment.\nIn this context, it is essential that the person concerned is sufficiently well informed of his role as a transmitter of disease.\nThe routine medical examination (normally taking place every year) of staff engaged in handling meat, poultrymeat and meat products has been carried out for many years in a number of countries, with the aim of reducing the risk of pathogenic micro-organisms being transmitted to the consumer through the meat, poultrymeat or meat products by the person concerned.\nAt various international meetings the question has been raised of whether such routine examinations, particularly of faeces, must necessarily form part of the measures to protect the consumer against contagious diseases that may be transmitted via badly handled meat, poultrymeat or meat products. The value of the routine examination of faeces for pathogenic intestinal bacteria, in particular, has repeatedly been called into question.\nIt emerges from the study of the reports of the abovementioned meetings that routine examinations, particularly of faeces samples, do not in any significant way contribute towards preventing contagious diseases from being transmitted to the consumer via meat, poultrymeat or meat products; in other words, the examination at regular intervals of faeces and urine of staff for Salmonella and Shigellae is no longer considered to be relevant. There should only be examination where it is justified on epidemiological or clinical grounds.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Health certificate for persons taking up employment in the food industry\n(This certificate is to be filled out in the presence of a doctor)\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Health attestation for persons employed in the food industry\n(This attestation is to be forwarded (duly completed) to the medical service of the undertaking)"}
