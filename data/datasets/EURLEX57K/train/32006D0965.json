A multi-annual approach for the programmes of eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses would ensure a more efficient and effective achievement of the objectives of those programmes and would provide for better and more transparent management and increased auditability, thus making more effective the use of Community funds. Therefore, it is appropriate to amend the provisions governing those programmes so as to include the possibility to finance multi-annual programmes.\n(3) That review also showed that a list with a limited number of animal diseases and zoonoses eligible for co-financing would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the eradication, control and monitoring programmes. The list of diseases and zoonoses which reflects Community priorities and whose eradication benefits from the Community financial contribution should be established taking into account the potential impact of such diseases and zoonoses on public health and on international and intra-Community trade of animals or product from animal origin. The specific provisions for the control of zoonoses should therefore be deleted. There should be a possibility to amend the list by comitology procedure to take into account emerging animal diseases or new epidemiological and scientific evidence.\n(4) In order to simplify the procedure for the approval of the eradication, control and monitoring programmes submitted by the Member States to the Commission, provision should be made for a single decision approving the programmes qualifying for a Community financial contribution to replace the two decisions currently required, one listing the programmes qualifying for financial contribution and the second on the approval of the programmes.\n(5) In order to allow the Commission to monitor the implementation of the programmes, Member States should report regularly to the Commission on the activities carried out, on the results achieved and the expenditure incurred.\n(6) Council Decision 90/638/EEC of 27\u00a0November\u00a01990 laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases\u00a0(4) lays down the technical and information requirements for the eradication, control and monitoring programmes for which Community financing is sought. Those technical requirements and information should be updated and adjusted in a regular and timely fashion in order to match technical and scientific progress and feedback from experience in the implementation of the programmes. It is therefore appropriate to enable the Commission to adopt, and update as necessary, those technical criteria. Council Decision 90/638/EEC should be repealed accordingly.\n(7) Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30\u00a0March\u00a02004 on the introduction of the Traces system\u00a0(5) establishes the integration of the pre-existing computerised systems (Animo and\u00a0Shift) into the new system. It is therefore appropriate to take into account the technical developments achieved in the computerisation of the veterinary procedures and to provide for the resources needed for the hosting, management and the maintenance of the integrated computerised veterinary systems taking into account the existence of national databases, where appropriate.\n(8) Information gathering activities are necessary to allow better development and implementation of legislation in the fields of animal health and food safety. Moreover, there is a pressing need to disseminate as widely as possible information regarding animal health and food safety legislation throughout the Community. It is therefore desirable to extend the scope of Decision 90/424/EEC so as to include the financing of information policy in the field of animal protection to animal health and food safety in products of animal origin.\n(9) Council Decision 2006/53/EC amending Decision 90/424/EEC established that Community financial contribution shall be granted for eradication measures carried out by the Member States to combat avian influenza. It is desirable that this contribution covers also the costs incurred by the Member States for compensation to owners for their losses due to the destruction of eggs.\n(10) Furthermore, Decision 90/424/EEC provides that technical and scientific assistance shall be granted to Member States for the development of Community veterinary legislation and training. Having regard to the past experience, it is desirable to extent the possibility for this assistance to international organisations such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).\n(11) For the sake of clarity, it is also appropriate to modify Decision 90/424/EEC in order to enable a Member State to inform the Commission of being directly threatened by the occurrence of the animal diseases in a third country or another Member State and to extend the animal diseases referred to in Article\u00a06 of that Decision to those provided for in the Annex.\n(12) Decision 90/424/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 90/424/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article\u00a01, the third indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses\u2019.\n(2) In Article\u00a03a, paragraph\u00a03, the first indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 50\u00a0% of the costs incurred by the Member State in compensating livestock owners for the killing of poultry or other captive birds and the value of the eggs destroyed.\u2019.\n(3) In Article\u00a06, paragraph\u00a01 is replaced by the following:\n(4) The title of Chapter 3 of Title I is replaced by following:\n(5) Article\u00a016 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the installation and development of information tools, including an appropriate database for:\n(i) gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation concerning animal health, animal welfare and food safety in products of animal origin;\n(ii) disseminating the information referred to in point\u00a0(i) to the competent authorities, producers and consumers, taking into account interfaces with national databases where appropriate;\n(b) the performance of studies necessary for the preparation and development of legislation in the field of animal welfare.\u2019.\n(6) Article\u00a019 is replaced by the following:\n(7) The title of Title II is replaced by the following:\n(8) Article\u00a024 is replaced by the following:\n(a) a description of the epidemiological situation of the disease before the date of the beginning of the programme;\n(b) a description and demarcation of the geographical and administrative area in which the programme is to be applied;\n(c) the likely duration of the programme, the measures to be applied and the objective to be attained by the completion date of the programme;\n(d) an analysis of the estimated costs and the anticipated benefits of the programme.\n(a) the programmes, where appropriate amended to take account of the assessment provided for in paragraph\u00a04;\n(b) the level of the financial contribution from the Community;\n(c) the upper limit of the financial contribution from the Community;\n(d) any conditions to which the financial contribution from the Community may be subject.\n(a) intermediate technical and financial reports;\n(b) by 30\u00a0April each year at the latest, an annual detailed technical report including the assessment of the results achieved and a detailed account of expenditure incurred for the previous year.\n(a) the rate of aid shall be in accordance with the rate laid down in Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01198/2006;\n(b) paragraph\u00a08 of this Article shall not apply.\n(9) Article\u00a026 is replaced by the following:\n(10) Articles\u00a029, 29a, 32 and\u00a033\u00a0are deleted.\n(11) In Article\u00a037a(1) is replaced by the following:\n(a) intra-Community trade in and imports of live animals and products of animal origin;\n(b) hosting, management and maintenance of integrated computerised veterinary systems, including interfaces with national databases, where appropriate.\u2019.\n(12) Article\u00a043a is replaced by the following:\n(13) The Annex is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "Decision 90/638/EEC is repealed from the date of taking effect of the Decision laying down the criteria referred to in the fourth subparagraph of Article\u00a024(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and the detailed rules referred to in Article\u00a024(10) of that Decision.", "For programmes approved before the taking effect of this Decision, the relevant provisions of Decision 90/424/EEC before it was amended by this decision shall continue to apply.
