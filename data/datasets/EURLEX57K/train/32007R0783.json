But, if that was the case, the obligations provided for in Article 11(2) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 would be superfluous, since they would overlap with the obligations arising from the entry/exit scheme provided for in Article 13 of that Regulation.\n(4) It is therefore not appropriate to fix the reference levels provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 for Bulgaria and Romania, nor to apply Article 11(2) and (4) of that Regulation to them, since that would not have any effect on the management of the fleet by those Member States.\n(5) Accordingly, derogations should be granted to Bulgaria and Romania from those provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation, Articles 11(2) and (4) and Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 shall not apply to Bulgaria and Romania.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 25 June 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
