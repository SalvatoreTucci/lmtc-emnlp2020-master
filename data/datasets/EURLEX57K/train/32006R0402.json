These methods should include the weighing of fresh bananas, to establish their net weight, and the drawing up of banana weighing certificates attesting that weight, by economic operators authorised by customs authorities. The net weight of fresh bananas should be established for each consignment of fresh bananas delivered by any means of transport.\n(2) To give sufficient time to Member States and economic operators to prepare for the authorisation of weighers, the measures concerning the weighing of fresh bananas and the drawing up of banana weighing certificates should apply from 1 June 2006.\n(3) For imports of certain electronic circuits covered by Chapters 84 and 85 of the Combined Nomenclature, countervailing duties have been imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1480/2003 of 11 August 2003 imposing a definitive countervailing duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain electronic microcircuits known as DRAMs (dynamic random access memories) originating in the Republic of Korea\u00a0(3). With a view to ensuring the uniform application of these countervailing duties, it is necessary to have a specific rule of origin for the products covered by the said Regulation.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93\u00a0(4) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for by this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as follows:\n1. after Article 290, the following text is inserted:\n2.
