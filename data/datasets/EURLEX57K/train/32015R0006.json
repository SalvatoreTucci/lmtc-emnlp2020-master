The new value should therefore be determined by taking into account only those mass values that it has been possible to verify by the manufacturers concerned, whilst excluding values from the calculation that were obviously incorrect, i.e. values exceeding 2\u00a0840 kg or lower than 500 kg as well as values relating to vehicles that did not fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0443/2009. The new value is moreover based on the weighted average taking into account the number of new registrations in each of the reference years.\n(4) Against that background, the M0 value to be applied from 1 January 2016 should be increased by 20,4 kg from\u00a01\u00a0372,0 to 1\u00a0392,4,", "main_body": ["Point 1(b) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) From 2016:\nM = mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg)\nM0 = 1\u00a0392,4\na = 0,0457\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 1."}
