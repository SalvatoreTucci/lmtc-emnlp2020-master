Fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative stability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery with due regard to the objectives of the common fisheries policy established in Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n(3) The total allowable catches (TACs) should be established on the basis of the available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at meetings with the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Regional Advisory Councils concerned.\n(4) For stocks subject to specific multiannual plans, the fishing opportunities should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, catch limits and fishing effort limits for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18 September 2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks\u00a0(2) (\u2018the Baltic Sea Cod Plan\u2019).\n(5) In the light of the most recent scientific advice, flexibility in the management of the fishing effort for cod stocks in the Baltic Sea can be introduced without jeopardising the objectives of the Baltic Sea Cod Plan and without causing an increase in fishing mortality. Such flexibility would allow for more efficient management of the fishing effort where quotas are not allocated equally among the fleet of a Member State and would facilitate swift reactions to quota exchanges. A Member State should, therefore, be allowed to allocate to vessels flying its flag additional days absent from port where an equal amount of days absent from port is withdrawn from other vessels flying the flag of that Member State.\n(6) The use of fishing opportunities as set out in this Regulation should be subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3), and in particular provisions concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the information on data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation which are to be used by the Member States when sending data to the Commission.\n(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas\u00a0(4), the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified.\n(8) In order to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihoods of Union fishermen, it is important to open the fisheries in question as from 1 January 2013. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS", "Subject matter\nThis Regulation fixes the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea for 2013.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to Union vessels operating in the Baltic Sea.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) zones\u2019 means the geographical areas specified in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound\u00a0(5);\n(b) \u2018Baltic Sea\u2019 means ICES Subdivisions 22-32;\n(c) \u2018Union vessel\u2019 means a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Union;\n(d) \u2018total allowable catch\u2019 (TAC) means the quantity that can be taken from each stock each year;\n(e) \u2018quota\u2019 means a proportion of the TAC allocated to the Union, a Member State or a third country;\n(f) \u2018day absent from port\u2019 means any continuous period of 24 hours or part thereof during which a vessel is absent from port.\nCHAPTER II\nFISHING OPPORTUNITIES", "TACs and allocations\nThe TACs, the quotas and the conditions functionally linked thereto, where appropriate, are set out in Annex I.", "Special provisions on allocations\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States as set out in this Regulation shall be without prejudice to:\n(a) exchanges made pursuant to Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002;\n(b) reallocations made pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009;\n(c) additional landings allowed under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(d) quantities withheld in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(e) deductions made pursuant to Articles 37, 105, 106 and 107 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except where otherwise specified in Annex I to this Regulation, Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 shall apply to stocks subject to a precautionary TAC, and Article 3(2) and (3) and Article 4 of that Regulation shall apply to stocks subject to an analytical TAC.", "Conditions for landing catches and by-catches\nFish from stocks for which catch limits are established shall be retained on board or landed only if the catches have been taken by vessels of a Member State having a quota and that quota is not exhausted.", "Fishing effort limits\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fishing effort limits are set out in Annex II.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limits referred to in paragraph 1 shall also apply to ICES Subdivisions 27 and 28.2, unless the Commission has taken a decision in accordance with Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 to exclude those Subdivisions from the restrictions provided for in Article 8(1)(b), Article 8(3), (4) and (5), and Article 13 of that Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limits referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to ICES Subdivision 28.1, unless the Commission has taken a decision in accordance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 that the restrictions provided for in Article 8(1)(b), and Article 8(3), (4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 shall apply to that Subdivision.\nCHAPTER III\nFINAL PROVISIONS", "Data transmission\nWhen, pursuant to Articles 33 and 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, Member States send the Commission data relating to landings of quantities of stocks caught, they shall use the stock codes set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 November 2012.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
