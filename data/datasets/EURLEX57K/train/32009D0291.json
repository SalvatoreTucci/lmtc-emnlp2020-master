The scope of harmonisation is defined in Article 3(1), which lists all the particulars that are compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs \u2018in accordance with Articles 4 to 17 and subject to the exceptions contained therein\u2019. Furthermore, Article 4(2) provides that other particulars in addition to those listed in Article 3(1) may be required, in the case of specified foodstuffs, by Community provisions or, in their absence, by national provisions.\n(4) Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC allows the adoption of non-harmonised national provisions if they are justified on one of the grounds listed therein, including, inter alia, the prevention of fraud and the protection of public health, and provided they are not of such a nature as to impede application of the definitions and rules laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC; therefore where draft national labelling provisions have been proposed in a Member State, it is necessary to examine their compatibility with the above-mentioned requirements and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(5) In accordance with Article 3(1) point 8 of Directive 2000/13/EC the indication of the place of origin or provenance is mandatory \u2018where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff\u2019. This provision, by providing an obligation to indicate the origin or the provenance of a food where other indications on the label of a given product could imply that such product comes from a different origin, provides an appropriate mechanism to counter the risk of consumers being misled.\n(6) In the case of poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat, the grounds presented by the Irish authorities do not allow for the conclusion that Irish consumers might, as a general rule, erroneously think that the products concerned come from a certain place.\n(7) Ireland has not provided any evidence that the draft Regulations are necessary to attain one of the objectives of the above-mentioned Article 18 or that the obstacle thus created is proportionate. It mentions only the aim of informing consumers on the origin of the products concerned. This ground alone is not sufficient to justify the draft Regulations.\n(8) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article 19, third paragraph of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(9) The Irish authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft Regulations in question.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Ireland shall not adopt the draft Health (Country of Origin of Poultrymeat, Pigmeat and Sheepmeat) Regulations.\nThis Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0109, 6.5.2000, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 308, 25.11.2003, p.\u00a015."}
