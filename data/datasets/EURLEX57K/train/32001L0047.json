Belgium acting as nominated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the Commission on 9 December 1997.\n(5) The draft assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 27 April 2001 in the format of the Commission review report for Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874). If this review report has to be updated to take account of technical and scientific developments, the conditions for the inclusion of DPX KE 459 Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874) in Annex I to the Directive will also need to be amended in accordance with the Directive.\n(6) The dossier and the information from the review of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874) were also submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for opinion on 16 December 1999. This Committee has given its opinion on 30 November 2000(4).\n(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a), (b) and (3) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the said Directive.\n(8) After inclusion, a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of the Directive on plant protection products containing Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874) and in particular to review, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. A longer period may also be required for plant protection products containing Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874) and other active substances included in Annex I.\n(9) As the uniform principles have still to be adopted for micro-organisms, it is appropriate that the Member States should apply the general provisions of Article 4 of the Directive when granting authorisations. It is also appropriate to provide Member States a reasonable period of time to re-evaluate authorisations granted in the light of the uniform principles after their adoption.\n(10) It is appropriate to provide that the finalised review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health delivered on 27 April 2001,", "main_body": ["The table in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC shall be amended to include the entry in respect of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874) set out in the Annex hereto.", "1.
