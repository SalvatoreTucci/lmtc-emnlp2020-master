It also provides that refund certificates applied for and, in some cases, refund certificates issued, are to be communicated to the Commission.\n(2) Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to a situation in which less or no applications for refund certificates have been submitted, consequently easing the pressure on the Union budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Union is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to increase the payment threshold beneath which small exporters are exempted from submitting a refund certificate at individual and at global level. It is also appropriate to suspend the obligations for the competent authorities of the Member States to notify the amounts of refund certificates applied for where the refunds applicable to all the basic products are either suspended, not fixed or equal to zero, to notify certain refund certificates issued where no refund certificates were issued and, where no amounts are involved, the obligation to notify certain information for guaranteeing the functioning and the management of the refund certificate system and to inform the Commission that no amounts have been granted.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 578/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 578/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 42(1) is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 43(1) is replaced by the following:\n(3) The following Article 53a is inserted:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 6.7.2010, p. 1."}
