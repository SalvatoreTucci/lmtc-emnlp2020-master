That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article\u00a07(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 3 July 2014\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, selenomethionine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC\u00a0R645 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use may be considered as an efficient source of selenium for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of selenomethionine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC\u00a0R645 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The Authority concluded that the limitation of the supplementation with organic selenium established for other organic compounds of selenium should also apply to selenomethionine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC\u00a0R645. Furthermore, in case different compounds of selenium are added to the feed, the supplementation with organic selenium should not exceed 0,2\u00a0mg per kg complete feed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018compounds of trace elements\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(7):3797.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nSelenium in mg/kg of complete feed with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of nutritional additives.
