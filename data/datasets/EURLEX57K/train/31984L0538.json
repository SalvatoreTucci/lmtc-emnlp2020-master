BARRY\nANNEX I  METHOD OF MEASURING AIRBORNE NOISE EMITTED BY LAWNMOWERS\nSCOPE\nThis measuring method applies to lawnmowers. It specifies the procedures for determining their sound power level so that their conformity with requirements may be attested.\nThese technical procedures comply with the requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC.\nThe provisions of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC shall apply to lawnmowers, with the following amendments:\n4. CRITERIA TO BE USED FOR EXPRESSING RESULTS\n4.1. Acoustic criteria for the environment.\nThe acoustic criterion for the environment of a lawnmower shall be expressed by the sound power level.\n6. MEASURING CONDITIONS\n6.1. Purpose of the measurement.\n6.1.1. Lawnmowers designed to be equipped with a device for collecting the grass shall be tested under normal conditions of use with that device fitted.\n6.1.2. The cutting device shall be adjusted to its minimum height, but shall not, however, be less than 3 cm from the ground. The grass in the test area shall be mown with this cutting device setting before any sound measurement is taken.\nFor the sound measurement, all grass shall be removed from the lawnmower and the grass collector shall be empty.\n6.2. Operation of the sound source during measurement.\nBefore each sound measurement is taken, the lawnmower shall be warmed up in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nThe sound power level of lawnmowers shall, in principle, be measured when the lawnmower is stationary without its operator being present and the cutting device and the motor are operating at maximum speed.\nIf the cutting device cannot be separated from the driving wheels of the lawnmower, the mower shall be tested while moving and driven by an operator under the following conditions:  - direct-drive lawnmower:\nin this case, it shall be moving at a speed such that the cutting device is operating at the maximum speed laid down by the manufacturer,\n- variable-drive lawnmower:\nin this case, the highest gear shall be selected. The lawnmower shall be moving at a speed such that the cutting device is operating at the maximum speed laid down by the manufacturer.\n(a) Lawnmowers with combustion engines:\nThe engine oil used for operating the mower during measurement shall be as specified by the manufacturer. The fuel tank shall not be more than half full.\n(b) Lawnmowers with electric motors:\nIf the lawnmower is powered by battery, the battery shall be fully charged. If the lawnmower is powered by a generating unit or from the mains, the frequency of the supply current specified for the motor shall be stable at \u00c2\u0105 1 Hz.\n6.3. Measuring site.\nThe test area shall be flat and horizontal. The area, including the microphone placements, shall be covered in turf which is not wet.\n6.4. Measuring surface, measuring distance, location and number of measuring points.\n6.4.1. Measuring surface.\nThe measuring surface to be used for the test shall be a hemisphere. The radius of the hemisphere shall be determined by the width of cut of the lawnmower.\nThe radius shall be:      - 4 m, where the width of cut of the lawnmower to be tested is no more than 1,2 m,\n- 10 m, where the width of cut of the lawnmower to be tested exceeds 1,2 m.\n6.4.2. Location and number of measuring points.\n6.4.2.1. General.\nFor the purpose of measuring the noise emitted by lawnmowers when stationary and in motion, six measuring points shall be used, i.e. points 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, arranged in accordance with section 6.4.2.2 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC. When measurements are taken for stationary mowers, the centre of the hemisphere shall coincide with the projection of the geometric centre of the lawnmower to the ground, pointing from measuring point 1 towards point 5. For moving measurements, the displacement axis shall pass through the positions of measuring points 1 and 5.\n7. MEASUREMENTS\n7.1.1. Extraneous noise.\nThe measurement of the level of parasitic noise shall not be taken into consideration (7.1.1 (b)).\n7.1.5. Presence of obstacles.\nA visual check in a circular area of a radius equal to three times that of the measurement hemisphere, the centre of which coincides with that of the hemisphere, shall be adequate to ensure that the provisions of the third paragraph of section 6.3 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC have been complied with.\n7.2. Measurement of the sound pressure level LpA.\nThe sound pressure LpA shall be measured in accordance with the first paragraph of section 7.2 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC. When the mower is in motion, the measuring time shall be the time which it takes to cover the distance AB (figure) at constant speed.\nThe sound pressure levels LpA of a lawnmower shall be measured at least three times. If the sound power levels obtained from these measurements differ by more than 1 dB, further measurements shall be taken until two power levels are obtained which do not differ by more than 1 dB and the higher of which shall be the sound power level of the lawnmower.\nNote : Where a sound level meter is used for measurements with the mower in motion, in most cases LpA shall be equal to the level measured when the mower passes the centre of the hemisphere.\n8. USE OF RESULTS\n8.6.2. Acoustic properties of test area.\nFor these measurements, the constant C determined in accordance with section 8.6.2 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC shall be between 0,5 and 2 dB with K2 = 0.\n9. DATA TO BE RECORDED\n9.1. Sound source under test:\n(f) width of cut;\n(g) speed of rotation of the cutting device.\n9.4. Acoustic data\n(b) delete \"area S of measuring surface in m2\";\n(c) place, date and time of measurements.\nAppendix\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026440\">\nANNEX II  MODEL CERTIFICATE OF CONFORMITY ISSUED BY THE MANUFACTURER\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026441\">\nANNEX III  MODEL FOR MARK FOR SOUND POWER LEVEL\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026442\">\nANNEX IV  TECHNICAL PROCEDURES FOR CHECKING THAT MOWERS CONFORM TO THE  REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIRECTIVE\nWhere possible, the conformity of mowers to the requirements of this Directive shall be verified by means of spot checks."}
