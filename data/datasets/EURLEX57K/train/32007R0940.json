To preserve their quality, they must be kept at a temperature of between 1\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0\u00b0C with a relative humidity of between 80\u00a0% and 90\u00a0%, i.e. in a cold chamber. Packaging in non-airtight packaging must therefore be done as close as possible to the marketing stage, which means in the production area, so as to guarantee the quality of the walnuts thanks to the special preservation conditions, which are kept constant from harvest. Fresh walnuts have a limited shelf life (they may not be dispatched after 15 October of the year of harvest) and may under no circumstances be converted into dry walnuts. Besides, it is specified on the packaging that fresh walnuts must be kept in the refrigerator.\nThe technical aspects described above also apply to dry walnuts. The products need to be packaged inside the production area not only because of their water content, but also because of their fat content: if not kept in proper conditions, there is a danger that they might become rancid. As in the case of fresh walnuts, but after 1 March, standards are set for the temperature (between 2\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C) and humidity (between 60\u00a0% and 75\u00a0%) at which they must be kept. Dry walnuts also have a limited shelf life: until 31 December of the year after harvest.\nName : INAO\nAddress : 51 rue d'Anjou, F-75008 Paris\nTel : (33) 153\u00a089\u00a080\u00a000\nFax : (33) 142\u00a025\u00a057\u00a097\nE-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nName : DGCCRF\nAddress : 59, boulevard V.-Auriol, F-75703 Paris Cedex 13\nTel : (33) 144\u00a097\u00a029\u00a060\nFax : (33) 144\u00a097\u00a030\u00a037\nE-mail : C3@dgccrf.finances.gouv.fr"}
