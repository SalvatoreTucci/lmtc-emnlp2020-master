That percentage corresponds to the Community share of total catches on this stock during the last five years and represents the estimated zone attachment calculated through survey data obtained during recent years. However, such approach should be without prejudice to the Community position as regards any future allocation negotiations with Norway.\n(7) Annex IA to Regulation No 51/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 16, 20.1.2006, p. 1.
