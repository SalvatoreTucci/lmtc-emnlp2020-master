The Commission shall take a decision on the application for simplified procedures for the deliberate release of genetically modified plants, as required under Article 6 (5) of Directive 90/220/EEC, by reference to the criteria set out in  paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 and by reference to the sufficient experience and evidence thereof referred to in Article 2.\n2. The criteria relating to the characteristics of the recipient plant species shall be as follows:\n(a) the taxonomic status and the biology (mode of reproduction and pollination, ability to cross with related species), should be well-known,\nand\n(b) information should be available on any interactions of particular relevance for the evaluation of risk, involving the recipient plant species and other organisms in agricultural ecosystems or in the experimental release ecosystem,\nand\n(c) scientific data should be available on the safety for human health and the environment of experimental releases involving genetically modified plants of the same recipient plant species.\n3. The criteria relating to the characteristics of the inserted sequences and their expression products shall be as follows:\n(a) the inserted sequences and their expression products should be safe for human health and the environment under the conditions of the experimental release,\nand\n(b) the inserted sequences should be:\n- well characterized, and\n- integrated into the plant nuclear genome.\n4. The criterion relating to the characteristics of the field release experiments shall be that whenever necessary, the appropriate practices for the management of risks will be applied during or after the experimental release, to ensure the protection  of human health and the environment.\n5. The criteria set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 should be applied in every case whereas the criterion set out in paragraph 4 should be taken into account when examining a proposed simplified procedure and applied as appropriate.", "1. A request for the application of simplified procedures shall be made in accordance with the procedures laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 and Article 3.\n2. The request shall be submitted to the Commission in writing and shall be accompanied by a dossier which shall include a description of the proposed simplified procedures, the conditions (if any) under which they are to be applied and information and  data on the sufficient experience which has been obtained of releases of the GMOs under consideration.\n3. Sufficient experience shall show that the GMOs under consideration are safe for human health and the environment and may be based on the competent authority's own experience with release of the same GMOs, experience with releases of the GMOs under  consideration in similar ecosystems and international experience.", "1. On receipt of the request and the accompanying dossier, the Commission shall immediately forward to the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the said request and accompanying dossier.\n2. Within 45 days following the dispatch of the request and accompanying dossier, any other competent authority may notify the Commission in writing of its intention to join in the request. To that end, the competent authority may submit any further or  additional evidence in support of the original request.\n3. Upon expiry of the time limit specified in paragraph 2, the Commission shall forthwith take a decision on the request in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 October 1993.\nFor the Commission\nYannis PALEOKRASSAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 117, 8. 5. 1990, p. 15."}
