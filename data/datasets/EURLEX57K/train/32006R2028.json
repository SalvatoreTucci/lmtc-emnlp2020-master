That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 12 July 2006 that the compatibility of the additive preparation of Bacillus licheniformis DSM 5749 and Bacillus subtilis DSM 5750 with maduramicin ammonium was established. The opinion of the Authority also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 600/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 600/2005 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
