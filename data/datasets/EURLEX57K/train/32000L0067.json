Pursuant to that Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), laid down the list of active substances of plant protection products to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.\n(2) In accordance with Article 5(1) of the Directive, an active substance should be included in Annex I if it may be expected that neither the use of, nor residues from, plant protection products containing that active substance will have any harmful effects on human or animal health or on groundwatr or any unacceptable influence on the environment.\n(3) Such an active substance may be included in Annex I for a period not exceeding 10 years.\n(4) For esfenvalerate the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Portugal was designated as rapporteur Member State under Regulation (EC) No 933/94 laying down the active substance of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. It submitted the relevant assessment report to the Commission on 11 October 1996, in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.\n(5) The assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 13 July 2000 in the format of the Commission review report for esfenvalerate.\n(6) The dossier and the information from the review have also been submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants for consultation. The Scientific Committee for Plants in its opinion(7) noted that Member States must apply appropriate risk mitigation measures to protect the aquatic environment and non-target arthropods.\n(7) It has appeared from the assessments made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined. It is appropriate therefore to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the granting, varying or withdrawing, as appropriate, of the authorisations of plant protection products containing esfenvalerate can be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.\n(8) Article 8(2) of the Directive provides that after inclusion of an active substance in its Annex I, Member States shall, within a prescribed period, grant, vary or withdraw, as appropriate, the authorisations of the plant protection products containing the active substance. In particular, Articles 4(1) and 13(1) of the Directive require that plant protection products are not authorised unless account is taken of the conditions associated with the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I and the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI on the basis of a dossier satisfying the data requirements laid down in its Article 13.\n(9) Before inclusion, a reasonable deadline is necessary to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion. Moreover, after inclusion, a reasonable period is necessary for the Member States to implement the Directive and in particular to vary or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations or grant new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive. For plant protection products containing several active substances, the complete evaluation on the basis of the uniform principles can only be carried out when all the active substances concerned have been included in Annex I to the Directive.\n(10) It is appropriate to provide that the finalised review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.\n(11) The review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive, where these principles refer to the evaluation of the Annex II data which were submitted for the purpose of the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to the Directive.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Esfenvalerate is hereby designated as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, as set out in the Annex hereto.", "1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive, at the latest by 31 January 2002 and shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. In particular they shall, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing esfenvalerate as an active substance within such period.\n2. However, with regard to evaluation and decision-making pursuant to the uniform principles provided for in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III thereto, the period laid down in the first paragraph is extended:\n- for plant protection products containing esfenvalerate as the only active substance, to four years from the entry into force of this Directive,\n- for plant protection products containing esfenvalerate together with another active substance which is in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, to four years from the entry into force of such Directive as shall include the last of those substances in Annex I.\n3. Member States shall keep available the review report (except for confidential information within the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) for consultation by any interested parties or shall make it available to them on specific request.\n4.
