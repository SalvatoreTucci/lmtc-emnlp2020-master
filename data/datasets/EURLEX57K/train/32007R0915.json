Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 of 4 April 2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security\u00a0(2) was the first act laying down such measures.\n(2) The measures provided for by Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 on restricting liquids carried by passengers arriving on flights from third countries and transferring at Community airports should be reviewed in the light of technical developments, operational implications at airports and the impact on passengers.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Such a review has shown that the restrictions on liquids carried by passengers arriving on flights from third countries and transferring at Community airports create certain operational difficulties at these airports and cause inconvenience to the passengers concerned.\n(5) Developments in screening technology should, in due course, provide solutions to these problems but, until technical solutions become available, temporary measures should be applied and reviewed in line with Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006. Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002, the measures laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 were classified and were not published.
