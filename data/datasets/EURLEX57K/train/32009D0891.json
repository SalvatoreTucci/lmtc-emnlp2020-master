In May 2009, the Bosnian authorities agreed with the IMF on a new disbursing programme of EUR 1,15 billion over a three-year period which was approved by the IMF Board in July 2009.\n(4) Bosnia and Herzegovina has requested additional Community macro-financial assistance in view of the worsening economic situation and outlook.\n(5) Given that, following the assumptions of the IMF, a residual financing gap remains in the balance of payments in 2010, macro-financial assistance is considered an appropriate response to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s request under the current exceptional circumstances to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the current IMF programme. The present financial assistance is also expected to contribute to alleviate budgetary financing needs.\n(6) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Community\u2019s financial interests linked to the present financial assistance, it is necessary to provide for appropriate measures by Bosnia and Herzegovina related to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, as well as for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors.\n(7) The release of the Community financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.\n(8) This assistance should be managed by the Commission, in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee.\n(9) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those of Article 308,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall make available to Bosnia and Herzegovina macro-financial assistance in the form of a loan facility with a maximum principal amount of EUR 100 million and a maximum average maturity of 15 years with a view to supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s economic stabilisation and alleviating its balance of payments and budgetary needs as identified in the current IMF programme.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To this end, the Commission is empowered to borrow on behalf of the Community the necessary resources.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The release of the Community financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission, in close cooperation with the Economic and Financial Committee, in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community financial assistance shall be made available for two years starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 2(1).
