On 18 July 2013, the Commission adopted Implementing Decision 2013/390/EU\u00a0(3), which stated that European standards EN 15649 parts 1-7 for floating leisure articles meet the general safety requirement in Directive 2001/95/EC for the risks they cover, and published their references in part C of the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(8) Since then, the European Committee for Standardisation has revised the European standard EN 15649-2:2009+A2:2013 for floating leisure articles for use on and in the water.\n(9) European standard EN 15649-2:2009+A2:2013 fulfils the mandate M/372 and complies with the general safety requirement in Directive 2001/95/EC. Its reference should therefore be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(10) On 27 July 2011, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/476/EU\u00a0(4) on the safety requirements to be met by European standards for stationary training equipment.\n(11) On 5 September 2012, the Commission issued standardisation mandate M/506 to the European standardisation organisations to develop European standards for stationary training equipment. These standards were to follow the principle that during normal reasonable and foreseeable conditions of use, risks of injury or damage to health and safety shall be minimised by the equipment's design or safeguards.\n(12) The European Committee for Standardisation adopted European standards (EN 957 parts 2 and 4-10) and a European standard EN ISO 20957 part 1. These fall within the scope of the Commission's mandate.\n(13) On 13 June 2014 the Commission adopted Implementing Decision 2014/357/EU\u00a0(5), which stated that European standards series EN 957 parts 2 and 4-10 and a European standard EN ISO 20957 part 1 for stationary training equipment meet the general safety requirement in Directive 2001/95/EC for the risks they cover, and published their references in part C of the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(14) Since then, the European Committee for Standardisation has revised the European standard EN 957-6:2010+A1:2014 for stationary training equipment.\n(15) European standard EN 957-6:2010+A1:2014 fulfils the mandate M/506 and complies with the general safety requirement in Directive 2001/95/EC. Its reference should therefore be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["The references of the following standards shall be published in the part C of the Official Journal of the European Union:\n(a) EN 15649-2:2009+A2:2013 \u2018Floating leisure articles for use on and in the water \u2014 Part 2: Consumer information\u2019;\n(b) EN 957-6:2010+A1:2014 for \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 6: Treadmills, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a011, 15.1.2002, p.\u00a04.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2005/323/EC of 21 April 2005 on the safety requirements to be met by the European standards for floating leisure articles for use on or in the water pursuant to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0104, 23.4.2005, p.\u00a039).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2013/390/EU of 18 July 2013 on the compliance of European standards series EN 15649 (parts 1-7) for floating leisure articles for use on and in the water with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and publication of the references of those standards in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ L\u00a0196, 19.7.2013, p.\u00a022).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2011/476/EU of 27 July 2011 on the safety requirements to be met by European standards for stationary training equipment pursuant to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0196, 28.7.2011, p.\u00a016).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2014/357/EU of 13 June 2014 on the compliance of European standards series EN 957 (parts 2 and 4-10) and EN ISO 20957 (part 1) for stationary training equipment and of ten European standards for gymnastic equipment with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and publication of the references of those standards in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ L\u00a0175, 14.6.2014, p.\u00a040)."}
