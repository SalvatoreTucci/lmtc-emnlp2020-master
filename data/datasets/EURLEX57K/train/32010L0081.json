In the comments received no major concerns were raised and the other Member States and EFSA did not raise any point which would exclude the extension of the use. The draft assessment report together with that addendum was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 October 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for 2-phenylphenol.\n(4) The new information on the application techniques submitted by the notifier and the new assessment carried out by the rapporteur Member State indicate that plant protection products containing 2-phenylphenol may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the indoor uses as a post-harvest fungicide which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. Consequently, it is no longer necessary to restrict the use of 2-phenylphenol to closed drench chambers, as laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC as amended by Directive 2009/160/EU.\n(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the notifier submit further information to confirm the residue levels occurring as a result of application techniques other than those in drench chambers.\n(6) Furthermore, it is also appropriate to require Member States to pay particular attention to the protection of operators and workers and ensure that conditions of use prescribe the application of adequate personal protective equipment.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 December 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
