Consequently, standard EN 848-3:1999 continued to confer a presumption of conformity to the essential safety requirements set out in Directive 98/37/EC.\n(4) In relation to the formal objection lodged by Sweden, the Commission mandated the European Standardisation Organisation (CEN) to amend standard EN 848-3:1999 by 1 January 2005, in order to give special attention to the risk of ejection of pieces and to the installation of protective features providing enhanced protection.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 98/37/EC, on 28 July 2005, Germany lodged a formal objection in respect of standard EN 848-3:1999.\n(6) Having examined standard EN 848-3:1999, the Commission has established that it fails to meet essential health and safety requirements 1.1.2(a) (Principles of safety integration), 1.3.2 (Risk of break-up during operation), 1.3.3 (Risks due to falling or ejected objects) and 1.4.1 (General requirements for guards and protection devices) of Annex I to Directive 98/37/EC. The specifications of EN 848-3:1999 in clause 5.2.7.1.2 (b), paragraphs 1 to 6, concerning the characteristics of and the choice of materials for curtain guards, especially strip curtains, are not adequate to prevent the foreseeable ejection of parts of tools.\n(7) CEN has not yet amended standard EN 848-3:1999, as requested in the standardisation mandate No 311 awarded to it as regards Directive 98/37/EC.\n(8) Pending the amendment of standard EN 848-3:1999, in the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of standard EN 848-3:1999 should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate warning. Member States should add an identical warning in their national standards transposing standard EN 848-3:1999.\n(9) The reference of standard EN 848-3:1999 should therefore be replaced accordingly,", "main_body": ["The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of standard EN 848-3:1999 \u2018Safety of woodworking machines \u2014 One side moulding machines with rotating tool \u2014 Part 3: Numerical control (NC) boring machines and routing machines\u2019 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex.", "Where, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 98/37/EC, Member States publish the reference of a national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 848-3:1999, they shall add to that publication a warning identical to that set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.

On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.\nNote 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.\nNote 4 Presumption of conformity for a product is achieved by complying with the requirements of Part 1 and the relevant Part 2 when this Part 2 is also listed in the OJ under Directive 98/37/EC.\nNote:\n\u2014 Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to the Directive 98/34/EC\u00a0(2) of the European Parliament and Council amended by the Directive 98/48/EC\u00a0(3).\n\u2014 Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\n\u2014 This list replaces all the previous lists published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
