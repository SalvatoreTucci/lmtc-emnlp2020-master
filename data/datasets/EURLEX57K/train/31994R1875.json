whereas the significant reduction of consumption aid or the intervention price  could bring about a temporary disturbance of the market, particularly in the passage from one marketing year to another; whereas, in order to redress these difficulties, provision should be made for the possibility of adopting interim measures;\nWhereas Articles 95 and 293 of the Act of Accession make provision for Community aid for the production of olive oil in Spain and Portugal; whereas Articles 79 and 246 of that Act provide for the progressive alignment of the Community aid in Spain and  Portugal on the common aid at the beginning of each marketing year; whereas, in the light of the increase in production aid following the decrement in consumption aid, application of the rules on that alignment would have the effect of increasing the  difference between the level of aid in Spain and Portugal and the level applicable in the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985; whereas, to avoid this inequitable effect, the rules should be amended so as to maintain the rate of alignment  provided for in the Act of Accession;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 5 (4) and Article 20d (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the percentages of production aid to be allocated to finance measures to improve the quality of olive oil production and to finance expenditure incurred in the  work done by recognized producer organizations or associations thereof in administering and controlling olive oil production aid should be determined;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 11 (5) and (6) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, a certain percentage of the consumption aid during each olive oil marketing year is to be used, on the one hand, to finance measures by the recognized trade organizations referred  to in paragraph 3 of the abovementioned Article and, on the other hand, to finance measures to promote olive oil consumption in the Community; whereas the said percentages for the 1994/95 marketing year should be fixed; whereas having regard to the  financing already laid down for the promotion actions referred to in the abovementioned Article 11 (6), the percentage relating thereto is set at zero for the marketing 1994/95;\nWhereas Article 5 (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC fixes, for a specified period, the maximum quantity in respect of which the unit amount of production aid fixed for each of the marketing years in question is to be payable; whereas, in compliance with  the terms laid down therein, the maximum quantity applicable for each of those marketing years should be maintained, in respect of the 1994/95, 1995/96 and 1996/97 marketing years, at the level specified,", "main_body": ["1.
