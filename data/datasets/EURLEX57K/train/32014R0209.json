That Regulation provides that food business operators producing raw milk and dairy products and colostrum and colostrum-based products intended for human consumption are to comply with the relevant provisions of Annex III thereto.\n(2) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 provides that food business operators importing products of animal origin from third countries are to ensure that importation takes place only, if the third country of dispatch appears on a list drawn up in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and the products satisfy, inter alia, the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and any import conditions laid down in accordance with Union legislation governing import controls for products of animal origin.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 605/2010\u00a0(4) lays down the public and animal health conditions and the certification requirements for the introduction of consignments of raw milk and dairy products into the Union. It also lays down the list of third countries from which the introduction of such consignments into the Union is authorised.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 establishes different import conditions depending on the animal health status of the exporting third country as regards foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and rinderpest. Third countries which are free from FMD without vaccination and rinderpest for the period for at least 12 months prior to import are listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 and imports into the Union of raw milk and dairy products, derived from raw milk from those third countries, are authorised without having undergone a specific treatments.\n(5) The Commission received several requests from some Member States and trade partners to establish animal health conditions for the imports of colostrum and colostrum-based products for human consumption into the Union.\n(6) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 does not apply to colostrum and colostrum-based products. However, colostrum represents the same animal health risks as raw milk for FMD. Colostrum can therefore be safely imported from countries which are already authorised for import of raw milk and listed in listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010.\n(7) Several commercial products are made of pasteurised or sterilised colostrum. However, since the effects of pasteurisation and sterilisation have not been validated for colostrum which has a high cell content, pasteurised or sterilised colostrum and colostrum-based products should only be imported from those third countries which are free from FMD without vaccination, listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010.\n(8) Articles 11, 12 and 13 of Council Directive 97/78/EC\u00a0(5) lay down the rules and conditions for the checks to be applied to consignment of products of animal origin imported into the Union but destined for a third country either by immediate transit or after storage in the Union.\n(9) In order to allow the introduction of colostrum and colostrum-based products into the Union, a new model health certificate for such commodities should be added in Part 2 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 and the model health certificate for raw milk and dairy products for human consumption intended for transit through or storage in the Union set out in Part 3 of Annex II to that Regulation should be amended in order to cover colostrum and colostrum-based products.\n(10) In order to include colostrum and colostrum-based products in the scope of the Common Veterinary Entry Document referred to in Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004\u00a0(6), it is necessary to provide in the model of health certificates covering such products the appropriate Harmonised System code listed in Chapter 4 of Annex I to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC\u00a0(7).\n(11) To avoid any disruption in trade, the use of animal health certificate for raw milk and dairy products for human consumption, intended for transit through or storage in the Union, issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 605/2010, should be authorised during a transitional period.\n(12) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010\nRegulation (EU) No 605/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) the title
