That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital), as a feed additive for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) was authorised for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 666/2003\u00a0(2) concerning the provisional authorisation of the use of certain micro-organisms in feedingstuffs, for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003\u00a0(3) concerning the provisional authorisation of certain micro-organisms in feedingstuffs (Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus), for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(4) concerning the permanent authorisation of an additive and the provisional authorisation of a new use of certain additives already authorised in feedingstuffs.\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 23 January 2007 that the preparation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(5). According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is efficacious in improving performance parameters according to doses recommended by the Authority in piglets and pigs for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. That opinion also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 May 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
