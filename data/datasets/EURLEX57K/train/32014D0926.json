The Commission will continue to closely monitor banana imports from Peru,", "main_body": ["The temporary suspension of preferential customs duty on imports of fresh bananas of heading 0803\u00a090\u00a010 of the European Union Combined Nomenclature originating in Peru is not appropriate during year 2014.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a017, 19.1.2013, p.\u00a01."}
