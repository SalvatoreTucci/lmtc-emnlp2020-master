In view of the developments of the sector, such rules should also apply to certified seed potatoes.\n(3) Those rules should concern the designation of uniform Union grade names. They should also include conditions for the placing on the market of seed potatoes and lots of seed potatoes as any of the respective Union grades. Those conditions should concern, as appropriate, the presence of pests, potatoes belonging to other varieties, and potatoes with blemishes, shrivelling, soil or extraneous matter.\n(4) The requirement that the growing plant is raised in a production ground where three years have elapsed since potatoes were last grown, and that it is subject to a least two official inspections, is no longer necessary in view of the more stringent requirements for the Union grades set out in this Directive.\n(5) Since the adoption of Directive 2002/56/EC, scientific knowledge has developed concerning the link between the number of generations and the level of presence of pests of seed potatoes. Limiting the number of generations is a necessary way of mitigating the phytosanitary risk posed by pests in latent form. That limitation is necessary for the mitigation of that risk, and no other less stringent measures are available to replace it. Experience has shown that for the Union grades S, SE and E maximum numbers of generations should be allowed for each of those Union grades. In order to ensure compliance with the substantive requirements, those requirements should only be considered to be fulfilled on the basis of an official inspection.\n(6) Directive 93/17/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Union grades of basic seed potatoes\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that basic seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grade S\u2019 if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) the potatoes have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (1)(a) of Annex I; and\n(b) their lots have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (1)(b) of that Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that basic seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grade SE\u2019 if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) the potatoes have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (2)(a) of Annex I; and\n(b) their lots have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (2)(b) of that Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that basic seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grade E\u2019 if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) the potatoes have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point 3(a) of Annex I; and\n(b) their lots have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (3)(b) of that Annex.", "Union grades of certified seed potatoes\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that certified seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grade A\u2019 if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) the potatoes have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (1)(a) of Annex II; and\n(b) their lots have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (1)(b) of that Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that certified seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grade B\u2019 if they fulfil the following conditions:\n(a) the potatoes have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (2)(a) of Annex II; and\n(b) their lots have been found by official inspection to fulfil the conditions, as set out in point (2)(b) of that Annex.", "Information to the Commission\nMember States shall inform the Commission of the extent to which they apply the respective Union grades in certifying their own production.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2015 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
