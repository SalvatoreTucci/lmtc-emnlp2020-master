Pursuant to that Decision, a Community financial measure is to be introduced to reimburse the expenditure incurred by the Member States for the financing of national programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of the animal diseases and zoonoses listed in the Annex to that Decision.\n(2) Decision 90/424/EEC provides that each year, by 30 April at the latest, Member States are to submit to the Commission the annual or multi-annual programmes starting in the following year for which they wish to receive a financial contribution from the Community.\n(3) Article 24(2) of that Decision lists certain elements which have to be contained in the programmes submitted by the Member States, such as a description of the epidemiological situation of the disease, the area where the programme is to be applied, the objective and likely duration of the programme, the measures to be applied and the costs and benefits of the programme.\n(4) Council Decision 90/638/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases\u00a0(2) laid down certain criteria for eradication and monitoring programmes in order to be approved pursuant to Decision 90/424/EEC. Decision 2006/965/EC repeals Decision 90/638/EEC from the date the present Decision takes effect.\n(5) New criteria for the national programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses listed in Annex I to Decision 90/424/EEC should be laid down in order to match technical and scientific progress and to take account of experience in the implementation of the programmes under Decision 90/638/EEC. Those new Community criteria should ensure that the measures provided for in those programmes are effective and secure the more rapid eradication, control and monitoring of the diseases and zoonoses concerned.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In order to be approved under the Community financial measure provided for in Article 24(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC, programmes submitted by the Member States to the Commission for the eradication, control and monitoring of the animal diseases and zoonoses listed in the Annex to that Decision must meet at least the criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
