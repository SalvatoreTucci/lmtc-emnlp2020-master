In the expectation that the market difficulties which justified the said Regulation would have been resolved by the end of the year 2001, Annex III to that Regulation lays down that the last tender was to be held on 10 December 2001.\n(2) Although the market situation for categories B and E have improved satisfactorily, the situation for cows of category D is still extremely serious. Furthermore, a substantial number of cows which for reasons linked to the beef crisis were not slaughtered in 2001 is expected to be brought to the market in the first quarter of 2002. In order to avoid a further collapse of the market for cow meat, it is necessary to provide an appropriate support by way of a continuation for no more than three more months of the purchase scheme laid down in Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 with purchases not exceeding 40000 tonnes.\n(3) Due to the urgency of the measures this Regulation should enter into force immediately.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
