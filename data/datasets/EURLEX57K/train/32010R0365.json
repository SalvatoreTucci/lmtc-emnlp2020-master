Part 1.3 provides limits for ready-to-eat foods unable to support the growth of L. monocytogenes, other than those intended for infants and for special medical purposes. Food business operators are required to prove compliance with the criteria in products placed on the market during their shelf-life.\n(4) According to the Regulation (EC) 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety\u00a0(3), food grade salt is a ready-to-eat food. According to scientific evidence, presence and survival of L. monocytogenes in salt is unlikely in normal circumstances. Therefore, food grade salt should be added to footnote 4 of Chapter 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 which provides for the ready-to-eat foods in which regular testing of L. monocytogenes is not required.\n(5) According to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005, a process hygiene criterion applies to Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products including an analytical reference method and limits.\n(6) The analytical reference method set out for Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products ISO 21528-1 has been shown to be difficult to use for routine analyses in own checks since it is very laborious and time consuming. Due to the methodological development the analytical reference method of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products should be changed to ISO 21528-2 which is quicker and easier to perform.\n(7) Analytical reference methods have an effect on test results. Therefore, the criterion limit of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products needs to be changed accordingly. The change would still guarantee sufficient detection limit for the process hygiene since likely problems in the manufacturing process would cause much higher growth of Enterobacteriaceae.\n(8) Given a recent change in taxonomy the name of Enterobacter sakazakii in Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should be changed to Cronobacter spp. (Enterobacter sakazakii).\n(9) Some of the provisions were applicable until 1 January 2010 and new ones already laid down in the Regulation will apply thereafter. To facilitate readability of these provisions, it is appropriate to delete the old ones.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.
