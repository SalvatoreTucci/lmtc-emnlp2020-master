The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas.\n(2) The Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96(6), laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. These provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation.\n(3) Certain characteristics of China's economy, the seasonal nature of some of the products and the time needed for transport mean that orders for products subject to quota are generally placed before the beginning of the quota yeare. It is therefore important to ensure that administrative constraints do not impede the realisation of the planned imports. In order not to affect the continuity of trade flows, the arrangements for allocating and administering the 2001 quota should accordingly be adopted before the start of the quota year.\n(4) After examination of the different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94, the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted. Under this method the quotas are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants.\n(5) This has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows.\n(6) The reference period used for allocating the portion of the quota set aside for traditional importers in earlier Regulations on the administration of these quotas should be updated to ensure open access to the quotas. In order to allow a greater flexibility to the benefit of traditional importers it is considered appropriate to allow them to set their reference period as either 1998 or 1999, which are the most recent years representative of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question. Traditional importers must therefore prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the years 1998 or 1999.\n(7) It has been found in the past that the method provided for in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, which is based on the order in which applications are received, may not be an appropriate way of allocating that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers. Consequently, in accordance with Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, it is appropriate to provide for allocation in proportion to the quantities requested, on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94.\n(8) In order to ensure that the quotas can be efficiently allocated and used, any speculative applications should be excluded, and it is furthermore necessary to allocate economically significant quantities. To this end the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume.\n(9) For the purposes of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers.\n(10) The Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. The information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question.\n(11) In view of the special nature of transactions concerning products subject to quota, and in particular the time needed for transport, the import licences should expire on 31 December 2001.\n(12) These measures are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the administration of quotas set up under Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down for 2001 specific provisions for the administration of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94.\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 shall apply, subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.", "1.

Instead of the documents referred to in the first indent of Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 applicants may enclose with their licence applications documents drawn up and certified by the competent national authorities on the basis of available customs information as evidence of the imports of the product in question during the calendar years 1998 or 1999 carried out by themselves or, where applicable, by the operator whose activities they have taken over.", "Member States shall inform the Commission on later than 22 September 2000 at 10 a.m., Brussels time, of the number and aggregate quantity of import licence applications and, in the case of applications from traditional importers, of the volume of previous imports carried out by traditional importers during the reference period referred to in Article 4(1) of this Regulation.", "The Commission shall adopt the quantitative criteria to be used by the competent national authorities for the purpose of meeting importers' applications no later than 14 October 2000.", "Import licences shall be valid for one year, starting on 1 January 2001.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 66, 10.3.1994, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 21, 27.1.1996, p. 6.\n(3) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 89.\n(4) OJ L 159, 3.6.1998, p. 1.\n(5) OJ L 87, 31.3.1994, p. 47.\n(6) OJ L 131, 1.6.1996, p. 47.\nANNEX I\nALLOCATION OF THE QUOTAS\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\nMAXIMUM QUANTITY WHICH MAY BE REQUESTED BY EACH IMPORTER OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL\n>TABLE>\nANNEX III\nLIST OF THE COMPETENT NATIONAL AUTHORITIES\n1.
