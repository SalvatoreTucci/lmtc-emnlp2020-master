Interest payments and interest-like charges cover nominal interest payments and all elements included in the calculation of effective interest.\n2. Where service charges are defined as a proportion of the transaction value, the purchaser prices are defined as the proportion itself, multiplied by the value of a representative unit transaction in the base or reference period.", "Treatment of service charges\n1. The HICP subindices concerned shall be calculated using a formula which is consistent with the Laspeyres-type formula used for other subindices. They shall reflect the price change on the basis of the changed expenditure of maintaining the consumption pattern of households and the composition of the consumer population in the base or reference period.\n(a) The purchaser prices of services to be used in the HICP shall be the actual charges levied directly on consumers in exchange for the service provided. The HICP shall include charges expressed as a flat fee or flat rate.\n(b) Changes in purchaser prices which reflect changes in the rules determining them shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.\n(c) Changes in the purchaser prices resulting from changes in the values of the representative unit transactions shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.\n(d) The representative unit transactions shall be expressed in physical terms, except where this is not appropriate or possible, in which case they shall be expressed in the currency of the Member State.\n(e) The change in the values of the representative unit transactions may be estimated by the change in a price index which represents appropriately the unit transactions concerned. Where they exist, HICP subindices or aggregate indices shall be deemed appropriate for this purpose.\n2. Where the specification changes, prices shall be treated in accordance with the rules on specification changes, and in particular those regarding quality adjustment as laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1749/96.\n3. Where services have been made available to consumers free of charge and subsequently an actual price is charged, the change from zero to an actual price, and vice versa, shall be reflected in the HICP.\n4. Where services jointly provided with other goods or services have been made available to consumers free of an explicit charge and subsequently are charged for on a separate basis, the change shall be reflected in the HICP.\n5.
