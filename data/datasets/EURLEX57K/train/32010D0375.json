The Commission is required to determine essential laboratory and analytical uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.\n(2) Decision XIX/18 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential laboratory and analytical uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, as well as Decisions VI/9, VII/11, XI/15 XV/5, XVI/16 and XXI/16 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.\n(3) Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of methyl bromide, listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol, necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical critical uses of methyl bromide.\n(4) Under the Montreal Protocol global laboratory and analytical-use exemption is subject to periodic review and has last been extended by Decision XXI/6 until 31 December 2014.\n(5) Decision VI/25 specifies that a use can only be considered as essential if there are no available technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health. An Annex listing those uses for which the Parties of the Montreal Protocol consider alternatives to be available should be established. This Annex should also contain the positive list of permitted essential uses of methyl bromide, as agreed by the Parties in Decision XVIII/15.\n(6) The Commission has published a notice to undertakings intending to import or export controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer to or from the European Union in 2010 and undertakings intending to request for 2010 a quota for these substances intended for laboratory and analytical uses\u00a0(2) and has received declarations on intended essential laboratory and analytical uses of controlled substances for 2009.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009,", "main_body": ["The production and import of controlled substances other than hydrochlorofluorocarbons may be permitted for any essential laboratory and analytical use specified in Annex I.", "The quantity of controlled substances other than hydrochlorofluorocarbons subject to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 which may be produced or imported for essential laboratory and analytical uses in the Union in 2010 shall be 63\u00a0843,371 ODP kilograms.", "The allocation of essential laboratory and analytical use quotas for controlled substances other than hydrochlorofluorocarbons for the year 2010 shall be to the undertakings indicated in Annex II.
