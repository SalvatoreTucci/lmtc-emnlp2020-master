In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005 as given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience has shown that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable.\n(5) If such criteria are to be checked, applications should be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n(6) Also in order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2005 should be denied access to the quota. Moreover, a security should be fixed for import rights, licences should not be transferable and import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(7) To provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, maximum and minimum limits should be fixed for the number of animals covered in each application.\n(8) It should be established that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the arrangements have to be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary in addition to or by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(5).\n(10) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that the application should constitute, with regard to the import rights security, a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(6).\n(11) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(12) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should not apply.\n(13) To guarantee a smooth functioning of the management of this quota it should be foreseen that the present Regulation starts to apply as of the date of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1182/2005.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Community tariff quota is hereby opened on an autonomous and transitional basis for the period from the date of entry into force of the present Regulation until 31 December 2005 for the import of 2\u00a0300 heads of any live bovine animal originating in Switzerland weighing more than 160 kg, falling within CN code 0102\u00a090\u00a041, 0102\u00a090\u00a049, 0102\u00a090\u00a051, 0102\u00a090\u00a059, 0102\u00a090\u00a061, 0102\u00a090\u00a069, 0102\u00a090\u00a071 or 0102\u00a090\u00a079.\nThis tariff quota shall have the order number 09.4203.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be those provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible under the quota provided for in Article 1, applicants must be natural or legal persons and must prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, at the time they submit their applications, that they have imported at least 50 animals covered by CN codes 0102\u00a010 and 0102\u00a090 during the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005.\nApplicants must be listed in a national VAT register.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of import shall be furnished exclusively by means of the customs document of release for free circulation, duly endorsed by the customs authorities and containing a reference to the applicant concerned.\nMember States may accept copies of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, duly certified by the competent authority.
