whereas, according to Article 87 (2) (b), such a Regulation must lay down detailed rules for the  application of Article 85 (3), taking into account the need to ensure effective supervision, on the one hand, and to simplify administration to the greatest possible extent on the other; whereas, according to Article 87 (2) (d), such a Regulation is  required to define the respective functions of the Commission and of the Court of Justice;\nWhereas liner shipping is a capital intensive industry; whereas containerization has increased pressures for cooperation and rationalization; whereas the Community shipping industry needs to attain the necessary economies of scale in order to compete  successfully on the world liner shipping market;\nWhereas joint-service agreements between liner shipping companies with the aim of rationalizing their operations by means of technical, operational and/or commercial arrangements (described in shipping circles as consortia) can help to provide the  necessary means for improving the productivity of liner shipping services and promoting technical and economic progress;\nHaving regard to the importance of maritime transport for the development of the Community's trade and the role which consortia agreements can fulfil in this respect, taking account of the special features of international liner shipping;\nWhereas the legalization of these agreements is a measure which can make a positive contribution to improving the competitiveness of shipping in the Community;\nWhereas users of the shipping services offered by consortia can obtain a share of the benefits resulting from the improvements in productivity and service, by means of, inter alia, regularity, cost reductions derived from higher levels of capacity  utilization, and better service quality stemming from improved vessels and equipment;\nWhereas the Commission should be enabled to declare by way of Regulation that the provisions of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty do not apply to certain categories of consortia agreements, decisions and concerted practices, in order to make it easier for  undertakings to cooperate in ways which are economically desirable and without adverse effect from the point of view of competition policy;\nWhereas the Commission, in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States, should be able to define precisely the scope of these exemptions and the conditions attached to them;\nWhereas consortia in liner shipping are a specialized and complex type of joint venture; whereas there is a great variety of different consortia agreements operating in different circumstances; whereas the scope, parties, activities or terms of  consortia are frequently altered; whereas the Commission should therefore be given the responsibility of defining from time to time the consortia to which a group exemption should apply;\nWhereas, in order to ensure that all the conditions of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty are met, conditions should be attached to group exemptions to ensure in particular that a fair share of the benefits will be passed on to shippers and that competition  is not eliminated;\nWhereas pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 of 22 December 1986 laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty to maritime transport (4) the Commission may provide that a decision taken  in accordance with Article 85 (3) of the Treaty shall apply with retroactive effect;
