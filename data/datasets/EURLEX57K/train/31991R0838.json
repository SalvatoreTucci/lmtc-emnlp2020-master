Special characteristics   1.1. Genetic:  Range of stable hybrids derived from crossing or original Badischer Geudertheimer with Havanna or Paraguay or with Havanna and Paraguay and vice versa in succession (backcrossing), with only slightly  variable morphological characteristics due to prolonged selection with a view to increasing productivity and creating resistance to pests and adverse weather conditions.  1.2. Botanical and morphological:  Under normal growing conditions the plants grow  to about 170 to 180 cm at flowering, with fairly short internodes, the habit tending to the cylindrical but also conical.   Average number of leaves for harvesting 25 to 30, oblique, secondary veins not prominent, good leaf surface, medium firm texture,  oval or elliptical shape, bright light green in colour, edges slightly drooping and sometimes undulating.   Inflorescence fairly open.   Upper edge of the corolla of the flowers bright red in colour.   Roots very extensive.   Erect, well developed pale  green stalk.   Leaves from suckers fairly prominent at the top of the plant.  1.3. Soil and climate:  Medium to loose soil, deep, cool and highly fertile, with well distributed rainfall from germination to flowering.  2. Conditions of production   2.1.  Plan population:  From 18 000 to 32 000 plants her hectare.  2.2. Topping:  Not always carried out in the south of Italy, but almost always in the north.  2.3. Harvesting:  Usually leaf by leaf according to position on the stalk.  2.4. Yield:  From 2  500 to 3 500 kilograms per hectare.  2.5. Curing:  Air curing under permanent or temporary structures with plastic roofing.  2.6. Grading and packing:  Generally unstrung and tied in bundles according to position on the stalk but also according to  quality category and packed in planters bales with jute fabric or blocks of a net weight varying from 20 to 60 kilograms.'"}
