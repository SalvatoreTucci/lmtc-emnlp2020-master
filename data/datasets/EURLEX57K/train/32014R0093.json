That list includes octanoic acid.\n(2) Octanoic acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 4, food and feed area disinfectants, and product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which correspond respectively to product-types 4 and 18 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority reports, together with recommendations, to the Commission on 7 December 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority reports were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 December 2013 in two assessment reports.\n(5) It appears from those reports that biocidal products used for product-types 4 and 18 and containing octanoic acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve octanoic acid for use in biocidal products for product-type 4 and 18.\n(7) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) For the use in product-type 4, the evaluation did not address the incorporation of biocidal products containing octanoic acid in materials and articles intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4). Such materials may require the establishment of specific limits on the migration into food, as referred to in Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. The approval should therefore not cover such use unless the Commission has established such limits or it has been established pursuant to that Regulation that such limits are not necessary.\n(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Octanoic acid shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-types 4 and 18, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (OJ L 338, 13.11.2004, p. 4).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nOctanoic acid IUPAC Name: 993\u00a0g/kg 1 September 2015 31 August 2025 4 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1) For industrial or professional users, safe operational procedures and appropriate organizational measures shall be established.
