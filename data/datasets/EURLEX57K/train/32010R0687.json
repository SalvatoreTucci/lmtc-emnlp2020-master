Pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 6 of that Article, a producer organisation is to invoice the marketed production of fruit and vegetables at the \u2018ex-producer organisation\u2019 stage, where applicable, as product which is packaged, prepared, or has undergone first-stage processing.\n(3) Point (i) of Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 contains a definition of \u2018first-stage processing\u2019. However, that definition has given rise to difficulties of interpretation. Since legal certainty requires clear rules on the calculation of the value of marketed production, that definition should be deleted and the definition of \u2018by product\u2019 should be adapted accordingly.\n(4) The calculation of the value of fruit and vegetables intended for processing has proven difficult. For control purposes and for the sake of simplification, it is appropriate to introduce a flat rate for the purposes of calculating the value of fruit and vegetables intended for processing, representing the value of the basic product, namely fruit and vegetables intended for processing, and activities which do not amount to genuine processing activities. Since the volumes of fruit and vegetables needed for the production of processed fruit and vegetables differ largely between groups of products, those differences should be reflected in the applicable flat rates.\n(5) In the case of fruit and vegetables intended for processing that are transformed into processed aromatic herbs and paprika powder, it is also appropriate to introduce a flat rate for the purposes of calculating the value of fruit and vegetables intended for processing, representing only the value of the basic product.\n(6) In order to ensure the smooth transition to the new system for the calculation of the value of the marketed production for fruit and vegetables intended for processing, operational programmes approved by 20 January 2010 should not be affected by the new calculation method, without prejudice to the possibility to amend those operational programmes in accordance with Articles 66 and 67 of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007. For the same reason, the value of the marketed production for the reference period of operational programmes approved after that date should be calculated under the new rules.\n(7) In order to allow for more flexibility in the use of market withdrawals, it is appropriated to increase the annual margin of overrun set out in Article 80(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007.\n(8) In order to facilitate free distribution, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to allow charitable organisations and institutions to ask a symbolic contribution from the final recipients of products subjected to market withdrawals, in case those products have undergone processing.\n(9) The flat-rate amounts for transport, sorting and packaging costs for free distribution of fruit and vegetables withdrawn from the market set out in Article 83(1) and Annex XI of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 should be updated.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007\nRegulation (EC) No 1580/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
