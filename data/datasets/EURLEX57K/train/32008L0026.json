Those measures are designed to adapt definitions; elaborate upon or supplement the provisions of that Directive by technical modalities for disclosure of inside information, insider lists, reporting of managerial and suspicious transactions to competent authorities; and present the research in a fair manner. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2003/6/EC by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 2003/6/EC provides for a time restriction concerning the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their statement concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament\u2019s wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the co-decision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time limit. The European Parliament and the Council also declared that they would make sure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that provide for a time limit on the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the provision establishing that time restriction in Directive 2003/6/EC should be deleted.\n(6) The Commission should, at regular intervals, evaluate the functioning of the provisions concerning the implementing powers conferred on it in order to allow the European Parliament and the Council to determine whether the extent of those powers and the procedural requirements imposed on the Commission are appropriate and ensure both efficiency and democratic accountability.\n(7) Directive 2003/6/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) Since the amendments made to Directive 2003/6/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States. It is therefore not necessary to lay down provisions to that effect,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 2003/6/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
