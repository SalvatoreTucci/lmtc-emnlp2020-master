In addition, each importation from the Republic of Poland into Germany of goods used for the construction and the maintenance of the border bridges would be subject to value added tax in Germany.\n(6) The purpose of these derogations is to simplify the rules of taxation for the contractors carrying out the work in question.\n(7) The derogations will have only a negligible effect on the own resources of the European Communities accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["The Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorised to conclude an agreement with the Republic of Poland containing measures derogating from the Sixth VAT Directive.
