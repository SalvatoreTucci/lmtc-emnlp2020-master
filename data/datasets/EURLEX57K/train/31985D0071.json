The list shall be prepared and maintained by the Commission on the basis of the information supplied to it by the competent authorities of the Member States pursuant to Article 9 of the Directive.\n2. The list shall contain the following information in respect of each substance included:\n- the number of the notification,\n- the identity of the substance.\nIn addition, in respect of a dangerous substance, the list shall include its classification in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive, after it has been recorded in Annex I thereto, with its EEC number.\n3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the identity of the substance shall be recorded under:\n- its trade name(s), and\n- its chemical name in the IUPAC Nomenclature.\n4. Where the competent authority of a Member State has so requested pursuant to Article 11 of the Directive, the identity of a substance may be recorded under its trade name(s) alone as provided by the notifier pursuant to Article 6.1 of the Directive.\nIn the case of a dangerous substance, the identity of the substance may be so recorded until such time as the substance is added to Annex I of the Directive. After this addition to Annex I, the names contained therein will be added to the list.\nIn the case of a substance not classified as dangerous, the identity of the substance may be so recorded for a period of no longer than three years following its first inclusion in the list. However, for the purpose of ensuring observance of Article 7.3 of the Directive, where in the opinion of the competent authority concerned, the chemical name in the IUPAC Nomenclature itself reveals information concerning commercial exploitation or manufacturing, the substance shall be recorded under its trade name(s) alone for so long as this competent authority considers it necessary.\nDeclaration by the Commission\nThe Commission undertakes the commitment to use systematically, each time it is possible, the IUPAC name for addition of new dangerous substances to Annex I of the Directive."}
