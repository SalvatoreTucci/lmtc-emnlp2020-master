In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a certain minimum number of animals during the year previous to the annual quota period in question which, at the same time, should guarantee a fair access to the concessions. Given that the present concessions only apply to imports of animals from Bulgaria and considering the imports which are carried out from this country, a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience shows that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable.\n(5) If such criteria are to be checked, applications should be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n(6) Furthermore, in order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January previous to the beginning of the annual quota period in question should be denied access to the quota. Moreover, a security relating to import rights should be submitted in the Member States where the operator is entered in the national VAT register. Import licences should not be transferable and should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(7) To provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, maximum and minimum limits should be fixed for the number of animals covered in each application.\n(8) It should be established that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary in addition to or by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(4) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(10) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that the application should constitute, with regard to the import rights security, a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(6).\n(11) A proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(12) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should not apply.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["6\u00a0600 live bovine animals weighing not more than 300 kilograms falling within CN codes 0102\u00a090\u00a005, 0102\u00a090\u00a021, 0102\u00a090\u00a029, 0102\u00a090\u00a041 or 0102\u00a090\u00a049 and originating in Bulgaria may be imported into the Community free of duty in each 12-month period as from 1 July 2005.\nThe quota referred to in the first sub-paragraph shall have the order number 09.4783.\nThe quota referred to in the first sub-paragraph shall be increased each year by 600 head.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for import rights under the quota provided for in Article 1 may only be submitted by applicants which are natural or legal persons.
