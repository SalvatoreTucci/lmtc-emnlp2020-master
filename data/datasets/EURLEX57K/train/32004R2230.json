It is therefore necessary to stipulate how this principle should be implemented, in accordance with Article 36(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, in order to ensure efficiency.\n(2) Certain bodies in the Member States carry out tasks at national level which are similar to those of the Authority. Networking must make it possible to foster a framework for scientific cooperation allowing information and knowledge to be shared, common tasks to be identified, and optimum use to be made of resources and expertise. It is also important to facilitate the compilation of a Community-level summary of the data on food and feed safety collected by these bodies.\n(3) As these bodies are to be entrusted with certain tasks with a view to assisting the Authority with its general mission as defined by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is essential for them to be designated by the Member States on the basis of criteria covering scientific and technical competence, efficiency and independence.\n(4) Member States need to provide the Authority with evidence of compliance with the necessary criteria for the inclusion of competent bodies on the list drawn up by the Authority\u2019s Management Board.\n(5) Member States must also stipulate the specific areas of competence of the competent bodies designated, so as to facilitate the operation of the network. Thus, in accordance with European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003\u00a0(2), when preparing an opinion on a request for authorisation of a genetically modified food or feed, the Authority may ask a Member State\u2019s competent body for assessing foods and feeds to carry out a safety assessment of the relevant food or feed in accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(6) In accordance with the provisions of Article 27(4)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is important for the Advisory Forum to be able to ensure close cooperation with the Authority and the competent bodies of the Member States by promoting the European networking of organisations operating within the fields of the Authority\u2019s mission.\n(7) The tasks entrusted to the competent bodies on the list must involve providing the Authority with assistance with its mission to provide scientific and technical support in relation to Community policy and legislation, without prejudice to the Authority\u2019s responsibility for performing its tasks pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(8) Financial support must be granted on the basis of criteria which ensure that such support contributes efficiently and effectively to the performance of the Authority\u2019s tasks and to the Community priorities as regards scientific and technical support in the fields concerned.\n(9) It is important to ensure on a general basis that the tasks entrusted by the Authority to the network\u2019s member organisations are performed to high scientific and technical standards, efficiently (also with regard to deadlines) and independently. However, the Authority must remain responsible for allocating tasks to the competent bodies and for monitoring performance.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Competent organisations designated by the Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent organisations designated by the Member States in accordance with Article 36(2) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 shall meet the following criteria:\n(a) they must carry out scientific and technical support tasks in the fields within the mission of the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019), especially those with a direct or indirect impact on food or feed safety; in particular, these tasks must include the collection and analysis of data connected with risk identification, exposure to risks, risk assessment, food or feed safety assessment, scientific or technical studies, or scientific or technical assistance for risk managers;\n(b) they must be legal entities pursuing public interest objectives, and their organisational arrangements must include specific procedures and rules ensuring that any tasks entrusted to them by the Authority will be performed with independence and integrity;\n(c) they must possess a high level of scientific or technical expertise in one or several fields within the Authority\u2019s mission, especially those with a direct or indirect impact on food or feed safety;\n(d) they must have the capacity to operate in a network on scientific actions as referred to in Article 3 of this Regulation and/or the capacity to perform efficiently the types of task referred to in Article 4 of this Regulation which may be entrusted to them by the Authority.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall forward to the Authority, with a copy to the Commission, the names and details of the designated organisations, evidence that they comply with the criteria set out in paragraph 1, and details of their specific fields of competence.
