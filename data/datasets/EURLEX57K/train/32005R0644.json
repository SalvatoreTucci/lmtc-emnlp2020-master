In particular, it provides that all animals on a holding born after 31 December 1997 or intended for intra-Community trade after 1 January 1998 and, for animals on a holding in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia or Slovakia, born by the date of accession or intended for intra-Community trade after that date, that such animals shall be identified by an ear tag approved by the competent authority, applied to each ear (\u2018approved ear tags\u2019). It also provides for that both ear tags shall bear the same unique identification code (\u2018unique identification code\u2019), which makes it possible to identify each animal individually together with the holding on which it was born.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 also provides that bovine animals intended for cultural and sporting events (with the exception of fairs and exhibitions) may, instead of by an ear tag, be identified by an identification system offering equivalent guarantees and authorised by the Commission.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2680/1999 of 17 December 1999 approving a system of identification for bulls intended for cultural and sporting events\u00a0(2), lays down provisions for such bulls registered to the herd books of specified organisations. However, that Regulation only applies to certain breeds of bulls and to organisations in certain Member States.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to adopt a separate Regulation to establish a special identification system for animals recognised by the competent authority as being kept for cultural and historical purposes (\u2018the animals\u2019) on premises approved for that purpose by that authority (\u2018the premises\u2019).\n(5) The special identification system should, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, provide for derogations only from the application and removal of the approved ear tags. This regulation is without prejudice to the application of the other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000.\n(6) By way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, it is appropriate to provide that the approved ear tags may be removed without the permission of the competent authority, but under its control, after animals are moved to the premises and that such ear tags not need to be applied to animals born on such premises. In both cases the animals must be marked by specific means of identification. The approved ear tags should be applied to animals when they are moved from the premises or should accompany the animals if they are moved directly to other premises.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund Committee,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules for a special identification system for bovine animals recognised by the competent authority as being kept for cultural and historical purposes (\u2018the animals\u2019) on premises approved for that purpose by the competent authority (\u2018the premises\u2019).", "Removal and application of the ear tags provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The keeper of the animals shall, at all times, be in possession of the two ear tags approved by the competent authority in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 (\u2018the approved ear tags\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, where the animals are moved to the premises, the approved ear tags may be removed from the animals without permission of the competent authority but under its the control, provided that, at the latest when the approved ear tags are removed, the animals are marked by the means of identification chosen by the competent authority as provided for in Article 3(1) of this Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, where the animals are born on the premises, it shall not be compulsory to apply the approved ear tags to them, provided that, at the latest when the animals are 20 days old, they are marked by the means of identification chosen by the competent authority as provided for in Article 3(1) of this Regulation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the animals leave the premises the approved ear tags shall be applied to the animals.\nHowever, if the animals are moved directly to other premises referred to in Article 1 in the same Member State, it is sufficient for the approved ear tags to accompany the animals during the movement.", "Means of identification\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The animals shall be identified by the unique identification code provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000.
