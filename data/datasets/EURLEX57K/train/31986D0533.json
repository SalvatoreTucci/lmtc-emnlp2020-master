Objective of the programme\nDevelopment of aquaculture, taking into account the suitability of species for culture in Spain, rearing techniques, commercial viability and market prospects.\n2. Duration\nThe programme will cover 1986 only.\n3. Areas concerned\nThe whole of the littoral and inshore waters of Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.\n4. Priorities and development policy\nFuture activity will be concentrated on species with good market prospects and with well-established rearing technology. Among these species the most important are:\n- Oysters and palourdes\n- Tropical prawns (Penaeus spp.)\n- Turbot\n- Gilthead sea bream\n- Sea bass\n5. Present output and projects envisaged\nThe production data for 1985 gives a figure of 200 000 tonnes for mussels, the principal species reared in Spain, 4 000 tonnes for other molluscs and 250 tonnes for marine fish.\nPotential production is envisaged as being of the order of 86 000 tonnes for other molluscs and 200 000 tonnes for fish and crustaceans with only a relatively slight annual increase in mussel output, giving an eventual total of about 250 000 tonnes. Only a fraction of this increase will be achieved in the immediate future.\n6. Investment requirement\nTo achieve these production targets an investment of about 30 million ECU would be necessary during the period covered by the programme.\nNational aid to be allocated of these investments may be estimated at 1,5 million ECU.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by the Spanish Government as a framework for the Community and national financing schemes constitutes an initial measure to guide investments in aquaculture in Spain and it agrees with the Spanish authorities' analysis of the development potential.\n2. The Commission points out that the investments requirement contained in the programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n3. The Commission considers that the programme targets and their attainment should form the subject of a more detailed analysis in the light of developments in the structural and economic situaton of fish farms in Spain."}
