Fiji is currently listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005.\n(4) A Community inspection carried out in Fiji revealed serious shortcomings as regards hygiene in the handling of fishery products and in the capacity of the competent authorities of that third country to carry out reliable checks on fishery products. Accordingly, Fiji cannot provide the necessary guarantees that fishery products have been obtained in conditions at least equivalent to those governing the production and placing on the market of fishery products in the Community.\n(5) Imports into the Community of fishery products from Fiji should therefore no longer be authorised.\n(6) In order to allow the entry into the Community of fishery products from Fiji produced and certified before the entry into force of this Regulation, a transitional period should be laid down.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "For a transitional period not exceeding six weeks from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, Member States may authorise imports of fishery products from Fiji produced and certified before that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55; corrected version in OJ L 226, 25.6.2004, p. 22.
