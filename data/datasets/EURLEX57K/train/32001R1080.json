Implementing rules should be laid down for the 2001/02 quota year starting on 1 July 2001.\n(2) For the allocation of the quota the method laid down in the third indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should be applied, avoiding discrimination between the traders concerned. Access to the quota should therefore be extended to those traders known as \"new arrivals\".\n(3) Traditional importers should consequently be allocated 70 % of the quota, i.e. 37100 tonnes, in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota during the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000. In certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict traders' access to this part of the quota. Steps should be taken to make good any resulting damage.\n(4) Traders who can show that they are genuinely involved in trade of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota, i.e. 15900 tonnes, in accordance with a procedure whereby the parties concerned submit applications to be accepted by the Commission. Proof of genuine involvement in trade calls for evidence to be presented of trade of some significance in beef and veal with non-member countries during the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000.\n(5) In 1999 Belgian beef and veal exports were severely affected by discussion of dioxin. As far as the figure of 15900 tonnes is concerned, Belgium's situation as regards exports should be taken into account when the criteria relating to results are determined.\n(6) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is entered in the national VAT register.\n(7) In order to prevent speculation:\n- traders no longer involved in trade in beef and veal at 1 June 2001 should be denied access to the quota,\n- a security relating to import rights should be fixed,\n- the possibility of transferring import licences should be excluded,\n- the issue of import licences to traders should be limited to the import rights allocated to them.\n(8) To oblige traders to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be established that obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(4).\n(9) Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 24/2001(7), are applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation.\n(10) Effective management of the quota and fraud prevention in particular require used licences to be returned to the competent authorities so they can check that the quantities shown therein are correct. The competent authorities must accordingly be under an obligation to carry out such checks. The security to be lodged when licences are issued should be fixed at a level that ensures licences are actually used and returned to the competent authorities.\n(11) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1. A tariff quota totalling 53000 tonnes expressed in weight of boneless meat is hereby opened for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206 29 91 for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.\nThe serial number of the tariff quota shall be 09.4003.\nFor the purposes of the said quota, 100 kilograms of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 77 kilograms of boneless meat.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation, \"frozen meat\" means meat which is frozen and has an internal temperature of -12 \u00b0C or lower when it enters the customs territory of the Community.\n3.

For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the 15900 tonnes shall be allocated to traders who can furnish proof that they have:\n- imported at least 220 tonnes of beef in the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000 other than quantities imported under Regulations (EC) No 1142/98 and (EC) No 995/1999, or\n- exported at least 450 tonnes of beef in the same period.\nFor this purpose, \"beef\" means products covered by CN codes 0201, 0202 and 0206 29 91, and the minimum reference quantities shall be expressed in terms of product weight.\nNotwithstanding the second indent, the period of export for established traders entered in the VAT register in Belgium since 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1999.\n3. The 15900 tonnes referred to in paragraph 2 shall be allocated in proportion to the quantities applied for by eligible traders.\n4. Proof of import and export shall be furnished solely by means of customs documents of release for free circulation and export documents.\nMember States may accept copies of the abovementioned documents duly certified by the competent authorities.", "1. Traders who were no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 June 2001 shall not qualify under the arrangements provided for in this Regulation.\n2. Companies arising from mergers where each constituent undertaking has rights pursuant to Article 2(1)(a) shall enjoy the same rights as the undertakings from which they are formed.", "1. Together with the proof referred to in Article 2(4), applications for import rights shall be submitted before 11 June 2001 to the competent authority in the Member State where the applicant is entered in the national VAT register. Where an applicant submits more than one application under either of the arrangements referred to in Article 2(1)(a) or (b), all such applications shall be inadmissible.\nApplications pursuant to Article 2(1)(b) shall not cover more than 50 tonnes of frozen boneless meat overall.\n2. After the documents submitted have been verified, the Member States shall forward the following to the Commission before 25 June 2001:\n- in respect of the arrangements under Article 2(1)(a), a list of eligible applicants, including in particular their names and addresses and the quantities of eligible meat imported during the reference period concerned,\n- in respect of the arrangements under Article 2(1)(b), a list of eligible applicants, including in particular their names and addresses and the quantities applied for and an indication as to whether proof of import or export was furnished.\n3. All communications, including nil returns, shall be sent by fax using the forms in Annexes I and II.", "1. The Commission shall decide as soon as possible on the extent to which quantities covered by applications may be accepted.\n2. Where the quantities covered by applications for import rights exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall reduce the quantities applied for by a fixed percentage.", "1. The security relating to the import rights shall be EUR 6 per 100 kilograms net weight. It must be deposited with the competent authority together with the application for import rights.\n2. Import licence applications must be made for the quantity allocated. This obligation shall constitute a primary requirement within the meaning of Article 20(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85.\n3. If the decision on allocation by the Commission in accordance with Article 5 results in application of a reduction percentage, the security provided shall be released for the import rights applied for in excess of the rights allocated.", "1. Imports of the quantities allocated shall be subject to presentation of one or more import licences.\n2. Licence applications may be lodged solely:\n- in the Member State where the applicant has applied for import rights,\n- by traders allocated import rights. Import rights allocated to traders shall entitle them to import licences for quantities equivalent to the rights allocated.\n3. Following decisions on allocation by the Commission in accordance with Article 5, import licences shall be issued on application and in the names of the traders who have obtained import rights.\n4.
