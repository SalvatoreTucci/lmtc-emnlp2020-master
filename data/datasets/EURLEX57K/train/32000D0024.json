these operations may be continued, subject to a positive report being drawn up as stipulated in Decision 98/729/EC(5);\n(8) Although Bosnia-Herzegovina and FYROM have been included in the Central and Eastern Europe region since the adoption of Decision 97/256/EC, the EIB's total lending effort to applicant countries within this region should increase given the importance of the pre-accession facility the EIB plans to create for EIB lending for projects in these countries without a guarantee from the Community budget or Member States;\n(9) In these circumstances, the EIB should ensure that its guaranteed lending within the Central and Eastern Europe mandate will finance particularly projects in those countries which have fewer projects suitable for financing from the pre-accession facility or projects in non-applicant countries;\n(10) The Cooperation Agreements between the European Community and Nepal, between the European Community and Lao PDR and between the European Community and Yemen entered into force on 1 June 1996, 1 December 1997 and on 1 July 1998 respectively;

under the risk-sharing scheme the EIB should secure adequate non-sovereign third-party guarantees for commercial risks, with the budgetary guarantee in that case covering only political risks arising from currency non transfer, expropriation, war or civil disturbance;\n(15) The guarantee arrangements should not affect the excellent credit standing of the EIB;\n(16) Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1149/99(6), revised the target amount and the provisioning rate for the Loan Guarantee Fund established by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94(7);\n(17) The financial perspective for the period 2000 to 2006 according to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(8) envisages a ceiling for the loan guarantee reserve in the Community budget of EUR 200 million per annum;\n(18) EIB financing in eligible third countries should be managed, in accordance with the EIB's usual criteria and procedures, including appropriate control measures, as well as with the relevant rules and procedures concerning the Court of Auditors and OLAF, in such a way as to support Community policies and to enhance coordination with the Community's other financial instruments;

the setting and periodic review of the operation objectives and the measurement of their fulfilment are the responsibility of the EIB's Board of Directors; in particular, EIB financing in the candidate countries should reflect the priorities established in the accession partnerships between the Community and those countries; thus the transparency of the EIB lending under this Decision should be substantially enhanced;\n(19) As from the date on which this Decision takes effect, the Community guarantee covering the special earthquake facility for Turkey under Decision 1999/786/EC(9) shall take the form of an extension of the global guarantee under this Decision;\n(20) The EIB and the Commission will adopt the procedures for granting the said guarantee;\n(21) For the purpose of adopting this Decision, the only powers provided for by the Treaty are those set out in Article 308 thereof,", "main_body": ["1.
