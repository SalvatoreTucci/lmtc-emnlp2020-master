Products of an oil content of less than 3 %:      - starch content : less than 45 %\n- protein content (nitrogen content x 6.25) : not less than 11.5 %.  (1)OJ No 14, 21.1.1969, p. 1.

Products of an oil content of not less than 3 % and not more than 8 %:      - starch content : less than 45 %\n- protein content (nitrogen content x 6.25) : not less than 13 %.\nMoreover, such residues shall not contain ingredients which are not obtained from maize grains.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 April 1974.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 February 1974.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier ORTOLI"}
