The first amendment states that the seeds used must be of the Vialone Nano variety. The second amendment relates to the biometric characteristics of the rice grains and establishes minimum or maximum values instead of the average values provided to date. The third amendment concerns the physico-chemical parameters (amylase, gelatinisation, consistency, viscosity).\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendments in question and concluded that they are justified. Since these are minor amendments within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0510/2006, the Commission may approve them without using the procedure set out in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The specification for the protected geographical indication \u2018Riso Nano Vialone Veronese\u2019 is hereby amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "A consolidated version of the summary containing the main points of the specification is given in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 21.6.1996, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 163, 2.7.1996, p. 19.\nANNEX I\nThe following amendments to the specification for the protected geographical indication \u2018Riso Nano Vialone Veronese\u2019 have been approved:\n\u2018Description of product\u2019:\n(1) In Article 4(5),\nshould be replaced by :\n(2) In Article 6(1) concerning the biometric characteristics of the grain,\n\u2018length : 5,7\u00a0mm;\nwidth : 3,5\u00a0mm;\nthickness : 2,1\u00a0mm;\nshape (length/width) : 1,6\u2019,\nshould be replaced by :\n\u2018length : 5,6-5,8\u00a0mm;\nwidth : 3,4-3,6\u00a0mm;\nthickness : 2,0-2,2\u00a0mm;\nshape (length/width) : 1,5-1,7\u2019;\n(3) In Article 6(4) concerning the physico-chemical parameters,\n\u2018amylose : more than 23\u00a0% dry matter;\ngelatinisation time : 15,5 \u2013 16,5\u00a0minutes;\nconsistency index : more than 0,90\u00a0kg/cm2;\nviscosity index : less than 1,1\u00a0g/cm\u2019,\nshould be replaced by :\n\u2018amylose : no less than 21\u00a0% dry matter;\ngelatinisation time : between 15 and 20 minutes;\nconsistency index : no less than 0,85\u00a0kg/cm2;\nviscosity index : no more than 2,5\u00a0g/cm\u2019.\nANNEX II\nSUMMARY\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\n\u2018RISO NANO VIALONE VERONESE\u2019\nEC No: IT-PGI-0117-1529-16.2.2001\nPDO (\u00a0) PGI (X)\nThis summary sets out the main elements of the product specification for information purposes.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsible Department In The Member State:\nName : MINISTERO DELLE POLITICHE AGRICOLE, ALIMENTARI E FORESTALI\nAddress : Via XX Settembre n.20 \u2014 00187 ROMA\nTel. : 06-4819968\nFax : 06-42013126\ne-mail : qtc3@politicheagricole.it\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Group:\nName : Consorzio Tutela Riso Vialone Nano Veronese IGP\nAddress : Via Mazzini, 2b \u2014 37063 Isola della Scala (VR)\nTel. : 045 6630815\nFax : 045 7300397\ne-mail : \u2014\nComposition : Producers/processors (X) Other (\u00a0)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product:\nClass 1.6 \u2014 Fruit, vegetables and cereals\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specification:\n(summary of requirements under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0510/2006)\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name:\n\u2018Riso Nano Vialone Veronese\u2019\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description:\nBreed with a medium-early growing cycle, medium height, small, muticate, pearled grain.

This monitoring, in addition to the completion of records provided to this end and managed by the monitoring structure of producers and packaging establishments, and declarations on the system for monitoring the quantities produced, enable the traceability of the product to be ensured. All natural or legal persons recorded in these lists are subject to checks by the monitoring structure.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production:\nThe seeds used must be of the Vialone Nano variety and certified by ENSE.\nCompared with other more recent varieties, Riso Vialone Nano, which does not have a high yield, is susceptible to rice blast, is easily lodged and is a rice crop which requires particular care and attention.\nThe Veronese soils of the above-mentioned area, the spring water, the climate and the rotation of crops provide a balanced set of factors which make it possible for the growing cycle to be completed without difficulties, producing a complete, large caryopsis with an extended grain in the centre, which is not always found in other rice-growing areas.\nIt should be mentioned that Veronese soils, which are light and clear, have a pH value of 7,5 or higher, due to the presence of calcium, and that the water is also always alkaline.\nThis marked alkalinity characterises and clearly distinguishes the environment of the rice fields in the Verona area from that found in most Italian rice-growing areas, which tend to be acidic and often lacking in calcium.\nProcessing takes place in local rice-mills, the direct descendants of the numerous \u2018rice huskers\u2019 in the region during the 16th century, some of which have survived and are still operating. In these, the hull of the rice was removed by water-powered pestles. Although the production process is now usually carried out by modern machinery, it is done using criteria and striving for results stemming from a centuries-old tradition. The rice grains are never completely hulled and bleached; the grain remains partially covered by the pericarp and as such is in the best condition to be used in preparing typical Veronese risottos.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link:\nRiso Vialone Nano Veronese can be produced in the defined area because it has a uniform climate. The freshness and purity of spring water, fairly typical of the area, help make this possible. In these areas, crop rotation is used in rice growing, considerably reducing the use of plant protection products and chemical fertilisers.\nThe characteristics of the soil found in the Verona area differ from those of other rice-growing areas due to:\n\u2014 the soil pH, which is always alkaline;\n\u2014 the spring water coming from calcareous rock and, therefore, also alkaline;\n\u2014 the cultivation traditions which continue to maintain the rice-growing heritage.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body:\nName : Ente Nazionale Risi\nAddress : Piazza Pio XI, 1 \u2014 20123 MILANO\nTel. : 02 8855111\nFax : 02 861372\ne-mail : info@enterisi.it\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling:\nThe rice is packaged in paper sachets with the label of the associated rice-mill and the protection label.\nThe label must bear the wording \u2018Riso Nano Vialone Veronese IGP\u2019.\nThe logo consists of a representation in white of Cangrande della Scala on a horse, a yellow rice panicle on a black background; the bottom of the logo features a picture of the arms of Verona, with a red ladder on a yellow background."}
