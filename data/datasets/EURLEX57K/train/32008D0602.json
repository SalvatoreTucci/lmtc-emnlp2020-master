The LNI is located at the Member State premises,\n\u2014 an optional backup local national interface (hereinafter referred to as \u2018BLNI\u2019) which has the same content, function as the LNI.\nThe specific configuration of the LNI and BLNI will be specified and agreed with each individual Member State.\nThe LNI and BLNI are to be used exclusively for purposes defined by the Community legislation applicable to VIS.\nThe communication infrastructure between the CS-VIS and the NI-VIS shall consist of:\n\u2014 the network for Secure Trans-European Services for Telematics between Administrations (sTESTA) that provides an encrypted, virtual, private network (vis.stesta.eu) dedicated to VIS data and to communication between Member States according to the Community legislation related to VIS and between Member States and the authority responsible for the operational management for the CS-VIS.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Network services\nIn chapters 3, 5 and 7, whenever technologies or protocols are mentioned, it should be understood that equivalent technologies or protocols may be used. The deployment of the network shall take into account the readiness of Member States.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Network layout\nThe VIS architecture makes use of centralised services, which are accessible from the different Member States. For resiliency purposes these centralised services are duplicated to two different locations namely Strasbourg, France, hosting the principal CS-VIS, central unit (CU) and St Johann im Pongau, Austria, hosting the backup CS-VIS, backup central unit (BCU) in accordance with Commission Decision 2006/752/EC of 3 November 2006 establishing the sites for the Visa Information System during the development phase\u00a0(2).\nThe principal and backup central units shall be accessible from the different Member States via network access points \u2013 an LNI and a BLNI \u2013 interconnecting their national system to the CS-VIS.\nThe connection between the principal CS-VIS and the backup CS-VIS shall be open for any new future architectures and technologies and shall allow for the continuous synchronisation between the CU and BCU.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bandwidth\nThe bandwidth needed for the LNI and the optional BLNI may be different from one Member State to another.\nThe communication infrastructure shall offer site connection bandwidths adapted to the expected traffic load. The network shall supply sufficient minimal guaranteed upload and download speeds for each connection and it shall support the total bandwidth size of the network access points.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supported protocols\nThe communication infrastructure shall be able to support network protocols used by the CS-VIS, in particular HTTP, FTP, NTP, SMTP, SNMP, DNS, tunnelling protocols, SAN replication protocols and the proprietary Java-to-Java connection protocols of BEA WebLogic over IP.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Technical specifications\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IP addressing\nThe communications infrastructure shall have a range of reserved IP addresses that may solely be used within that network. Within the reserved IP range, the CS-VIS will use a dedicated set of IP addresses that will not be used elsewhere.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for IPv6\nThe local networks of most sites will be using IPv4 but some may use IPv6. Therefore the network access points shall offer the possibility to act as a IPv4/IPv6 gateway. Coordination with Member States evolving towards IPv6 will be required, in order to ensure a smooth transition.\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sustained flow rate\nAs long as the CU or BCU connection has a load rate less of 90\u00a0%, a given Member State shall be able to sustain continually 100\u00a0% of its specified bandwidth.\n3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other specifications\nTo support the CS-VIS, the communication infrastructure shall at least comply with a minimum set of technical specifications:\nThe transit delay shall be (including the busy hours) less or equal to 150\u00a0ms in 95\u00a0% of packets and less than 200\u00a0ms in 100\u00a0% of packets.\nIts probability of packet loss shall be (including the busy hours) less or equal to 10-4 in 95\u00a0% of packets and less than 10-3 in 100\u00a0% of packets.\nThe aforementioned specifications apply to each access point separately.\nThe connection between the CU and BCU shall have a round trip delay less or equal to 60\u00a0ms.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resiliency\nThe communication infrastructure shall offer high availability, in particular of the following components:\n\u2014 backbone network,\n\u2014 routing devices,\n\u2014 points of presence,\n\u2014 local loop connections (including physically redundant cabling),\n\u2014 security devices (crypto devices, firewalls, etc.),\n\u2014 all generic services (DNS, etc.),\n\u2014 LNI and optional BLNI.\nNetwork failover mechanisms shall be set up and, when required, coordinated with the application level to ensure maximum availability of the VIS as a whole.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring\nTo facilitate monitoring, the communication infrastructure\u2019s monitoring tools shall have the capability to be integrated with the monitoring facilities for the operational management of the CS-VIS.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generic services\nThe communication infrastructure shall be able to offer the following optional generic services: DNS, mail relay and NTP.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Availability\nThe availability of connection points up to the LAN of the communication infrastructure shall be 99,99\u00a0% over a 28-day rolling period.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Security services\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Network encryption\nNo VIS-related information shall circulate on the communication infrastructure without encryption.\nTo maintain a high level of security, the communication infrastructure shall allow managing the certificates/keys used by the network encryption solution. Remote administration and remote monitoring of the encryption boxes shall be possible.\nSymmetric encryption algorithms (3DES 128 bits or better) and asymmetric encryption algorithms (RSA 1\u00a0024 bit modulus or better) shall be used in accordance with the state of the art.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other security features\nBesides protecting the VIS network access points (LNI and BLNI), the communication infrastructure shall also protect the optional generic services. In case such services are made available, they should meet protection measures comparable to those in CS-VIS. Furthermore, the generic services devices and its protection measures should be under continuous security surveillance.\nIn order to maintain a high level of security, the communication infrastructure shall allow all security incidents to be reported without any delay. Reports on all security incidents shall be provided on a regular basis, e.g. monthly reporting and ad-hoc basis.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helpdesk and support structure\nA helpdesk and support structure shall be established and shall be able to interact with the CS-VIS.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interaction with other systems\nThe communication infrastructure shall ensure that data leakage towards other systems or other networks will not occur on the network.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 181, 18.5.2004, p. 25.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 305, 4.11.2006, p. 13."}
