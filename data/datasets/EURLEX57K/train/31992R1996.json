No 51900).\nThe triglycerides are eluted with 20 ml anhydrous hexane for HPLC.\nThe eluted product is dried in a nitrogen flow and placed in Isopropanol or acetone (5 ml). 10-20 \u0102\u0179l are injected into HPLC. For these two purification methods, the fatty acid composition of the oil must be checked to ensure that it is the  same before and after purification. If it is not the same, the absorbent quality used should be progressively reduced.'."}
