At present such Agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 95/284/EC(2) only with the ACP States party to Protocol 8 on ACP sugar annexed to the fourth ACP-EEC Lom\u0102\u0160 Convention, and with the Republic of India.\n(2) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 44 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance. The balance indicates the need to import raw sugar and to open at this stage for the 2000/2001 marketing year a tariff quota at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the above Agreements so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met for part of the year. The forecasts for raw cane sugar production are now available for the 2000/2001 marketing year. A quota should be opened at this stage for part of that year. Because of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member State and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorise imports for each refining Member State for the period 1 July 2000 to 28 February 2001.\n(3) The above Agreements lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question. This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2000/2001 marketing year.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The following tariff quotas are opened for the period 1 July 2000 to 28 February 2001 pursuant to Decision 95/284/EC in respect of imports of raw cane sugar for refining:\n(a) 200000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the ACP States covered by that Decision, bearing the serial number 09.4098; and\n(b) 10000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the Republic of India, bearing the serial number 09.4099.", "1.
