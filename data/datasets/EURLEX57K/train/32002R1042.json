It establishes in particular the conditions for the recognition of producer organisations and Annex I thereto establishes the minimum volume of marketable production of bananas and the minimum number of producers that the organisations must prove they have as members.\n(2) In order to fulfil the economic tasks assigned to the producer organisations as regards production and marketing, to increase income from marketing and to improve the management of the sector, the creation of larger units must be encouraged and the thresholds relating to the number of members and marketable volumes must be increased. To this end, the application of the thresholds laid down for the French production regions should be extended to the Canary Islands. Raising the thresholds for the other production regions in Greece and Portugal is not an option, in view of the characteristics of the producer organisations.\n(3) To facilitate the setting up of producer organisations adapted to the new thresholds, for 2002 the deadline by which the members of producer organisations established in Spain must notify any intention to resign should be extended.\n(4) The aid provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 should not be granted to producer organisations comprising the members of former producer organisations that have benefited from this aid scheme.\n(5) To allow the producer organisations to adapt to the new thresholds, the provisions of this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2003, with the exception of the provision on the notification of resignations to be given in 2002 which shall apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 919/94 should therefore be amended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 919/94 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
