The application of nitrogen from livestock manure on the arable crops of these farms would not, however, exceed 170 kg/ha nitrogen per hectare per year.\n(4) Approximately 13\u00a0500 farms, 500\u00a0000 hectares and 11\u00a0600 t year nitrogen corresponding respectively to 2,4 % farms, 2,9 % Utilised Agricultural Land and 0,7 % total manure nitrogen are estimated to be potentially encompassed by the derogation. They are mainly located in Bavaria (Oberbayern), Baden Wurttemberg (Tubingen), Lower Saxony (Luneburg, Weser-Ems) and Schleswig-Holstein.\n(5) The German legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC, Fertiliser Ordinance of 10 January 2006 amended lastly on 28 September 2006, has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.\n(6) Water quality data submitted by Germany with the Third Report on the implementation of the Nitrates Directive 2000-2003 and with the derogation request show a decrease in nitrates concentration of surface water at 83 % of monitoring stations and a stable concentration at 9 % of monitoring stations compared to the period 1991-1994. Regarding groundwater, the monitoring system established for the purpose of assessing implementation of the Directive 91/676/EEC shows that nitrate concentration is decreasing in approximately 50 % of monitoring stations and stable in approximately 15 % of monitoring stations.\n(7) The number of livestock decreased, in particular with regard to the number of cattle (-25 %). Manure nitrogen input per hectare per year dropped by 11 % between 1991-1993 and 2002-2004; nitrogen surplus decreased from 120 to 101 kg per hectare in the same period.\n(8) Germany, in conformity with paragraph 5 of article 3 of Directive 91/676/EEC, applies an action programme throughout its whole territory.\n(9) The supporting documents presented in the notification submitted by Germany show that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year of nitrogen from livestock manure is justified for intensive grassland fields on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\n(10) The Commission after examination of the request from Germany considers that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from livestock manure will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(11) This Decision should be applicable in connection with the present action programme in force for the period 2006 to 2009.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["The derogation requested by Germany by letter of 1 February 2006, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018cattle farms\u2019 means holdings with more than three livestock units, where at least two-thirds of livestock are cattle,\n(b) \u2018fields under intensive grassland\u2019 means the fields managed as permanent or temporary grassland (generally temporary lies less than four years), with at least four cuts per year or three cuts plus pasture.", "Scope\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis and subject to the conditions set out in Articles 4, 5 and 6 to cattle farms and it is restricted to fields under intensive grassland.", "Annual authorisation and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farmers who want to benefit from a derogation shall submit an application to the competent authorities annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the annual application referred to in paragraph 1 they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities shall ensure that all the applications for derogation are submitted to administrative control.
