methylene\nDefinition:\nIn accordance with the ministerial decision of 7 May 1955, taken after consultation of the laboratory service of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, 'r\u00e9gie type' methylene must satisfy the following requirements:\n- it must register 90 % vol at a temperature of 20\u00b0 C, with a tolerance of 0,5,\n- it must contain at least 6 % pyrogenic impurities (disregarding products that can be saponified by soda and expressed as methyl acetate),\n- it must contain ketones and water to bring the methyl alcohol up to 100,\n- it must be obtained exclusively from the carbonization of wood, carried out under the supervision of the tax authorities.\nThe pyrogenic impurities are the real denaturant. They give the mixture an unpleasant taste, making the alcohol unfit for oral consumption.\nThrough its chemical properties, acetone makes it easier, in the laboratory, to isolate the denaturant in the alcohol.\nLastly, methyl alcohol indicates denaturation. Its boiling point is much the same as that of ethyl alcohol. It can therefore be separated only by using special techniques and apparatus.\nIn principal, its presence, above a certain percentage, which varies according to the different types of ethyl alcohol, indicates whether the alcohol analysed has been previously denatured by the general process.\nIreland  Mineralized methylated spirits:\n- 9,5 % wood naphtha,\n- 0,5 % crude pyridine,\n- 0,025 ounce methyl violet dye (per 100 gallons of pure ethyl alcohol),\n- 0,375 % petroleum oil.\nNB: The wood naphtha and crude pyridine may be substituted with 10 % methyl alcohol.\nItaly  Per hectolitre of pure alcohol:\n- 125 grams of tiofene,\n- 0,8 grams of denatonium benzoate,\n- 0,4 grams of CI acid red 51 (red colourant),\n- 2 litres of methylethylketone.\nLuxembourg  Five litres methylene per hectolitre of ethyl alcohol irrespective of the alcoholic strength and sufficient colourant to produce a good markable blue or purple (violet) colour.\nThe following are included within the meaning of 'methylene':\n- actual methylene, that is to say raw methyl alcohol produced from the dry distillation of wood and containing at least 10 % by weight of acetone,\n- a mixture of methylene and methanol containing at least 60 % by weight of actual methylene and 10 % by weight of acetone,\n- a mixture of methanol, acetone and pyrogenetic impurities with a strong empyreumatic odour, containing at least 10 % by weight of acetone.\nNetherlands  Per hectolitre of ethyl alcohol:\nFive litres of a mixture consisting of:\n- 60 % by volume of methanol,\n- 11 % by volume of fusel oil (a concentrate of by-products of alcohol distillation),\n- 20 % by volume of acetone,\n- 8 % by volume of water,\n- 0,5 % by volume of butanol,\n- 0,5 % by volume of formalin (a watery solution of 37 % by weight of formaldehyde),\ntogether with colouring the quantity and constituents of which meet the conditions laid down by the chemist of the Fiscal Service.\nUnited Kingdom  Base:\n- 90 % vol ethanol,\n- 9,5 % vol 'wood naptha' (1), and\n- 0,5 vol crude pyridine.\nTo each 1 000 litres of which is added:\n- 3,75 litres of mineral naptha (petroleum oil) and\n- 1,5 ppm of methyl violet.\n(1) Wood naptha is a product which may be synthetic but must produce such properties as to render a mixture of 5 % wood naptha with 95 % spirits unfit for use as a beverage. This is achieved by producing a relatively complex but stable  'cocktail' of substances which cannot be easily removed from the spirits.\nComposition of 'wood naptha'\nThere is no prescriptive list of ingredients, but some or all of the following are found in approved synthetic wood naptha:\n- pyridine,\n- pyridine bases,\n- allyl alcohol,\n- crotenaldehyde,\n- picolene,\n- denatonium benzoate,\n- methyl alcohol."}
