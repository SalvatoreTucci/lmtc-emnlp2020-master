METHOD 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SAMPLING OF PARTLY DEHYDRATED MILKS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and field of application\n\u2014 unsweetened condensed high-fat milk,\n\u2014 unsweetened condensed milk,\n\u2014 unsweetened condensed partly skimmed milk,\n\u2014 unsweetened condensed skimmed milk,\n\u2014 sweetened condensed milk,\n\u2014 sweetened condensed skimmed milk,\n\u2014 sweetened condensed partly skimmed milk.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equipment\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nSee Section 2 of the General Provisions.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plungers and agitators\nPlungers or agitators, for mixing liquids in bulk, shall be of sufficient area to produce adequate disturbance of the product without developing rancid flavour. In view of the different shapes and sizes of containers, no specific design of plunger can be recommended for all purposes, but plungers shall be designed in such a way as to avoid scratching the inner surface of the product containers during agitation.\nSuitable material has been described in Section 2 of the General Provisions.\nA form of plunger recommended as being suitable for the mixing of liquids in buckets or in cans has the following dimensions (Fig. 1): a disc 150 millimetres in diameter, perforated with six holes each of 12,5 millimetres in diameter on a circle 100 millimetres in diameter, the disc being fixed centrally to a metallic rod, the other end of which forms a loop handle. The length of the rod, including the handle, shall be approximately 1 metre.\nA suitable plunger for use for small tanks, has the following approximate dimensions (Fig. 2): a rod not less than 2 metres in length, fitted with a disc 300 millimetres in diameter perforated with 12 holes each 30 millimetres in diameter on a circle 230 millimetres in diameter.\nFor mixing the contents of large vessels, mechanical agitation or agitation by clean compressed air is advisable. Minimal air pressure and volume shall be used to prevent rancid flavour development.\nNote: Wherever \u2018clean compressed air\u2019 is required by this guide, it is necessary to use compressed air from which all contaminants (including oil, water and dust) have been excluded.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stirrer\nBroad bladed, of sufficient depth to reach the bottom of the product container, and which preferably has one edge shaped to the contour of the container (see Fig. 3).\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dippers\nA dipper of suitable size and shape for collecting the sample is illustrated in Fig. 4. The dipper shall be fitted with a solid handle at least 150 millimetres in length. The capacity of the dipper shall be not less than 50 millilitres. It is an advantage for the handle to be bent over. The tapered form of the cup permits nesting of the dippers.\nAlternatively, a dipper of similar capacity may be used, but it should have parallel sides graduated into five equal sections for assistance in sampling proportionately consignments held in more than one container.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rod\nRound, about 1 metre long and 35 millimetres in diameter.\n2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Container\nFor sub-sampling capacity of 5 litres, wide mouthed.\n2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spoon or spatula\nBroad bladed.\n2.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample containers\nSee Section 3 of General Provisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling of unsweetened partly dehydrated milks\nA sample of not less than 200 grams shall be taken.\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The product shall be thoroughly mixed by plunging or stirring, or by mechanical agitation, or by pouring from one container to another, or by the use of clean compressed air (see note 2.2), until sufficient homogeneity is obtained.\nTake the sample immediately after mixing by means of a dipper. If obtaining sufficient homogeneity presents difficulties, samples shall be taken from different portions of the product container to a total of not less than 200 grams. (It shall be noted if the sample is a mixture of sub-samples on the sample label and in the accompanying report).\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling products packed in small retail containers\nThe intact and unopened container may constitute the sample. One or more containers with the same batch or code number shall be taken to make up a sample of not less than 200 grams.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling of sweetened partly dehydrated milk\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nThe sampling of bulk containers of sweetened partly dehydrated milk may be a matter of extreme difficulty, particularly when the product is not homogeneous and is highly viscous. Problems of sampling may arise through the presence of large crystals of sucrose or lactose, or through precipitation of various salts which may occur throughout the body of the product or adhere to the walls, or through the presence of lumpy matter. Such conditions will become apparent when a sampling rod is introduced into the product container and is withdrawn after exploring as large an area of contact as possible. Provided the size of sugar crystals is not larger than 6 millimetres, difficulties in sampling should not be experienced from this cause. When the product is not homogeneous, this fact shall be noted on the sample label of the accompanying report. Since sweetened condensed milk is frequently stored at atmospheric temperature, it is recommended that in order to obtain a representative sample the contents shall be brought to a temperature of not less than 20 o C.\n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\nA sample of not less than 200 grams shall be taken.\n\u2014 Open containers\n\u2014 Enclosed drums with bungs at the end, or at the side\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling products packed in small retail containers\nThe intact and unopened container may constitute the sample. One or more containers with the same batch or code number shall be taken to make up a sample of not less than 200 grams.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preservation, storage and transport of sample\nSee Sections 5 and 6 of the General Provisions.\nIII. METHOD 2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SAMPLING OF POWDERED PRESERVED MILK PRODUCTS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and field of application\nThis method describes the sampling for chemical analysis of:\n\u2014 dried whole milk or whole milk powder,\n\u2014 dried skimmed milk or skimmed milk powder,\n\u2014 dried partly skimmed milk or partly skimmed milk powder,\n\u2014 dried high-fat milk or high-fat milk powder.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equipment\nSee Section 2 of the General Provisions.\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Borers of sufficient length to reach the bottom of the product container\nBorers conforming to the description given in Part IV are appropriate.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scoop, spoon or broad-bladed spatula\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample containers\nSee Section 3 of the General Provisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nCare shall be taken to minimize the uptake of atmospheric moisture by the content of the product container or in the period prior to sampling for analysis. The product container shall be securely reclosed after sampling.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling\nA sample of not less than 200 grams shall be taken. The clean and dry borer shall be passed through the product, if necessary with the container inclined or laid on its side. The slit shall be oriented downward and an even rate of penetration used. When the borer reaches the bottom of the container it shall be rotated through 180o, withdrawn and the contents discharged into the sample container. One or more borers shall be taken to make a sample of not less than 200 grams. The sample container shall be closed immediately after sampling is complete.\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling products packed in small retail packages\nThe intact and unopened package may constitute the sample. One or more containers with the same batch or code number small be taken to make up a sample of not less than 200 grams.\nNote: When products are described as \u2018instant\u2019, a whole unopened package must constitute the sample.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preservation, stockage and transport of sample\nSee Sections 5 and 6 of the General Provisions.\nIV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BORERS FOR THE SAMPLING OF POWEDERED PRESERVED MILK IN BULK\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Types of borer\nType A: long\nType B: short\n(see Fig. 5).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Materials\nBlade and stem shall be made of polished metal, preferably stainless steel.\nThe grip of the long trype should preferably be made of stainless steel.\nThe short type borer shall have a detachable grip of wood or plastic, fitted with a bayonet catch in the blade.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Construction\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shape, material and finish shall be such as to permit the borer to be easily cleaned.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protruding edge of the blade of type A shall be sufficiently sharp to serve as a scraper.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The point of the blade shall be sufficiently sharp to facilitate sampling.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principal dimensions\nThe borers shall conform to the dimensions (subject to a tolerance of 10 %) given in the table hereafter:\n(Dimensions in mm)\nType A long Type B short\nLength of blade 800 400\nThickness of metal of blade 1 to 2 1 to 2\nInner diameter of blade at point 18 32\nInner diameter of blade at grip or stem 22 28\nSlit width at point 4 20\nSlit width at grip or stem 14 14\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note on use of borers\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With less free-flowing powders, the borers can be inserted vertically. Type A borers are then filled completely by turning and can be withdrawn vertically.
