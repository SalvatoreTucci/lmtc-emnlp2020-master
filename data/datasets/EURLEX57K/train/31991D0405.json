The Commission must therefore give a ruling, pursuant to Article 10 of the Decision, as to  whether they comply with the objectives and criteria set out in that Decision and whether they are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII\nSince the entry into force in 1987 of a restructuring plan made necessary by the lack of economic viability of coal production in the long term, extraction capacities have been gradually reduced from 4,4 million tonnes in 1987 to 0,8 million tonnes in  1991.\nThe amount of aid notified for 1991 represents only 20 % of the aid granted in 1986.\nThe decreasing levels of aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant, its temporary nature and the implementation of a multiannual restructuring plan are in accordance with the conditions of application of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nThe aid to cover operating losses will facilitate continuation of the last phase of the restructuring programme for the Campine coalfield, as decided by Ministerial Decree in January 1987. The planned aid will cover no more than 83 %, for each tonne  produced, of the difference between foreseeable costs and returns, and therefore complies with the provisions of Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nThis aid contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to the decline in coal production, in conformity with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.\nThe notification submitted to the Commission regarding the financing of social benefits in the coal industry reveals that the aid which the Belgian Government proposes to grant brings the ratio between the burden per mineworker in employment and the  benefits per person in receipt of benefit below the corresponding ratio in other industries. This difference should amount to Bfr 292 700 000 in 1991.\nThe exceeding of the limits specified in Article 7 of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC must therefore be considered as indirect aid to current production. The reduction in production costs this entails, which is about 6 %, does not constitute a significant  competitive advantage for the Belgian coal industry compared with other Community coal producers. In view of the abnormal burdens that the Belgian industry has to bear owing to the gradual decline in production.\nAs this measure is linked to the restructuring programme, it is helping to solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in conformity with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.\nThe aid to cover expenditure relating to the system of supplementary holiday for underground workers constitutes indirect aid to current production. It meets the objectives and conditions defined in Article 2 of the Decision in view of its modest scale  i.e. less than 1 % of the cost price per tonne produced, its temporary nature and the fact that it forms part of the restructuring plan.\nIII\nThe aid covered by this Decision is therefore compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision is without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of the rules governing sales of Belgian coal to electricity producers,", "main_body": ["The Belgian Government is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Bfr 2 587 970 000 to the Belgian coal industry for the 1991 calendar year.
