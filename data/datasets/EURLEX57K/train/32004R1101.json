However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.\n(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.\n(6) Tulathromycin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(7) Diclazuril should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 2004/28/EC\u00a0(4) of the European Parliament and of the Council to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the sixtieth day following its publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 June 2004.\nFor the Commission\nErkki LIIKANEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 87, 25.3.2004, p. 13.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 58.\nANNEX\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following substance(s) is (are) inserted in Annex I\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anti-infectious agents\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotics\n1.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Macrolides\nPharmacologically active substance(s) Marker residue Animal species MRLs Target tissues\n\u2018Tulathromycin (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S, 13S,14R)-2-ethyl-3,4,10,13-tetrahydroxy-3,5,8,10,12,14-hexamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-\u00df-D-xylo-hexopy-ranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopent-decan-15-one expressed as tulathromycin equivalents Bovine\u00a0(1) 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Fat\nPorcine 3\u00a0000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Liver\n3\u00a0000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Kidney\n100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Skin + fat\n3\u00a0000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Liver\n3\u00a0000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Kidney\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following substance(s) is (are) inserted in Annex II\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organic compounds\nPharmacologically active substance(s) Animal species\n\u2018Diclazuril all ruminants\u00a0(2)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption.\u2019\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0For oral use only\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0For oral use only.\u2019"}
