With regard to that substance, Directive 2008/116/EC has set a maximum level of 0,01\u00a0% for toluene as a manufacturing impurity. That level was based on the specification submitted by the notifier.\n(2) The notifier has asked for an amendment to Directive 91/414/EEC raising that maximum level to 0,05\u00a0%. It submitted the necessary information in support of its request. On 2 February 2009 the rapporteur Member State presented an addendum\u00a0(3) to the draft assessment report concluding that a maximum level of 0,05\u00a0% does not cause any risk in addition to the risks already taken into account in the Commission review report for that substance.\n(3) The maximum level of toluene as a manufacturing impurity of metazachlor should therefore be raised to 0,05\u00a0%.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(5) Since this Directive should start to apply on the same date as Directive 2008/116/EC, this Directive should enter into force as soon as possible.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In row 223 (metazachlor) of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, in column 4 (purity), \u20180,01\u00a0%\u2019 is replaced by \u20180,05\u00a0%\u2019.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 January 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
