The European Food Safety Authority also concluded that the monitoring plan provided in the notification was acceptable in view of the intended uses.\n(8) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of the genetically modified oilseed rape products (Brassica napus L., lines Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3) will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.\n(9) Processed oil from genetically modified oilseed rape derived from (a) the Ms8 oilseed rape line and all conventional crosses, (b) the Rf3 oilseed rape line and all conventional crosses and (c) the hybrid combination Ms8xRf3 has been placed on the market in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients\u00a0(2). As a consequence, it is subject to the requirements provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed\u00a0(3) and may be placed on the market and used in accordance with the conditions mentioned in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed.\n(10) Unique identifiers should be assigned to the genetically modified oilseed rape products (Brassica napus L., lines Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3) for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(5).\n(11) Adventitious or technically unavoidable traces of genetically modified organisms in products are exempted from labelling and traceability requirements in accordance with thresholds established under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(12) In the light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the products and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.\n(13) In the light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, an appropriate management system should be in place to prevent grains of the genetically modified oilseed rape products (Brassica napus L., lines Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3) entering cultivation.\n(14) Prior to the placing on the market of the products, the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market, including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should be applicable.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(6) the measures should be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Consent\nWithout prejudice to other Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 258/97 and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, written consent shall be granted by the competent authority of Belgium to the placing on the market, in accordance with this Decision, of the products identified in Article 2, as notified by Bayer BioScience nv (Reference C/BE/96/01).\nThe consent shall, in accordance with Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions to which the consent is subject, which are set out in Articles 3 and 4.", "Products\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genetically modified organisms to be placed on the market as or in products, hereinafter \u2018the products\u2019, are grains of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) from the individual female and male lines containing events Ms8 and Rf3 respectively as well grains obtained from traditional crossings (Ms8xRf3 hybrid) between these female and male parental lines, which contain the following inserted DNA:\nFemale line (Ms8)\n1.

The consent holder should inform operators that the possibility of and consequences arising from accidental spillage of Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3 oilseed rape have been evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the context of its intended uses. The consent holder should maintain regular contact with operators to ensure that they are informed of any changes to current practice which may change the conclusions of the environmental risk assessment.\n4. The consent holder should ensure that operators are alert to the possibility that accidental spillage of imported oilseed rape grains in ports and crushing facilities may result in the germination and establishment of volunteer plants, including Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3 oilseed rape.\n5. In the event that volunteer oilseed rape plants include Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3 oilseed rape, the consent holder should:\n(a) inform operators that these plants should be eradicated to minimise the potential for unanticipated adverse effects arising from the Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3 oilseed rape;\n(b) provide operators with appropriate plans for eradicating volunteer oilseed rape plants that include Ms8, Rf3 and Ms8xRf3 oilseed rape.\n6.
