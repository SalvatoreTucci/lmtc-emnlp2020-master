Article 6(1) of that Regulation provides that delivery must be effected not later than the end of the second month following receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August of the current marketing year.\n(2) During the 1999/2000 marketing year the intervention agencies encountered difficulties in setting up a good system for the storage, checking and reception of goods. These difficulties delayed the acceptance of offers made and the taking over of deliveries. For the 1999/2000 marketing year, these difficulties justify a derogation from the time limit set in the abovementioned provisions for delivery to the intervention agency.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 708/98, delivery of paddy rice for taking over by the intervention agency in respect of the 1999/2000 marketing year must be effected no later than 30 September 2000.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(2) OJ L 265, 30.9.1998, p. 4.\n(3) OJ L 98, 31.3.1998, p. 21.\n(4) OJ L 87, 31.3.1999, p. 8."}
