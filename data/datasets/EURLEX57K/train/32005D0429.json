The results obtained by the application of the specific monitoring programme should be periodically evaluated in cooperation with the Member States concerned. Where appropriate, that programme may be amended.\n(5) In order to harmonise the inspection and surveillance of the relevant fisheries at Community level, it is appropriate to draw up common rules for the inspection and surveillance activities to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, and that Member States adopt national control programmes in order to match such common rules. To that end, benchmarks for the intensity of inspection and surveillance activities should be fixed, as well as inspection priorities and inspection procedures.\n(6) Exchanges of national inspectors between the Member States concerned should be encouraged so as to enhance uniformity of inspection and surveillance practices and help develop the coordination of the control activities between the competent authorities of those Member States.\n(7) To ensure the follow-up of infringements in accordance with Article 25 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(4), a framework should be set up under which all the authorities concerned may request mutual assistance and exchange relevant information in accordance with Articles 34a and 34b of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Subject-matter\nThis Decision establishes a specific monitoring programme (the specific monitoring programme), for a period of two years, in order to ensure the harmonised control of compliance with the rules for promoting the recovery of cod stocks in the following areas, as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 423/2004:\n(a) Kattegatt;\n(b) North Sea;\n(c) Skagerrak;\n(d) Eastern Channel;\n(e) Irish Sea;\n(f) West of Scotland.", "Scope\nThe specific monitoring programme shall cover the inspection and surveillance of:\n(a) fishing activities by vessels using fishing gear types identified in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 as likely to catch cod in the areas referred to in Article 1 of this Decision;\n(b) all related activities including the transhipment, landing, marketing, transport and storage of fishery products and the recording of landing and sales.", "National control programmes\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom shall establish national control programmes in conformity with the common rules set out in Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National control programmes shall contain all the data listed in Annex II.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit to the Commission, three months after the communication of this decision at the latest, their national control programme and an implementation schedule for the first six months of their programme.
