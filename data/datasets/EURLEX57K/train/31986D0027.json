It proved necessary to increase the UK aid to cover pit operating losses since these were sharply increased in the 1984/85 coal marketing year owing to the unforeseeable strike. According to the information available to the Commission on the actual position of costs and returns in 1984, the loss per tonne rose considerably more than had been estimated. The increase in aid does not completely cover the pit operating losses for 1984; this measure is thus compatible with the provisions of Article 12 (1) (1) of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas the following remarks must be made in respect of the compatibility of the total amount of British aids to support current production (3 783 100 000 ECU or 76,43 ECU/t) with the proper functioning of the common market:\n- there has been no decline in trade in coal between the United Kingdom and the other Community countries,\n- industrial users of coking coal and steam coal did not receive aids as a result of artificially low prices of British coal;\nWhereas it may therefore be concluded that the additional aids proposed during the 1984/85 financial year for current production in the British coalmining industry are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ascertain that aids authorized are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must be informed in particular of the amount of these aids and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1984/85 financial year to grant an additional aid to cover losses on coalmining industry not exceeding \u00a3 1 711 800 000.", "The United Kingdom shall notify the Commission by 31 March 1986 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 January 1986.\nFor the Commission\nNicolas MOSAR\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 63, 11. 3. 1976, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 230, 29. 8. 1985, p. 52."}
