Purpose\nTo assist the development and modernization of on-shore facilities for fishery products.\n2. Area concerned\nAll coastal areas in the overseas departments.\n3. Duration\nThe programme covers the period from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1990.\n4. Objectives and means\nTo align supplies more closely on demand, both in quantitative and qualitative terms, by:\n- increasing the volume of supplies,\n- improved organization of marketing channels and trade between departments,\n- the construction of facilities for treating and preserving catches,\n- the provision of facilities for wholesalers,\n- the expansion of the processing industry.\n5. Investment requirements\nTo achieve the specified objectives, the total investment required over the duration of the programme amounts to FF 71,3 million (11 million ECU), broken down as follows:\n1.2 // MARTINIQUE   //   // - Processing facilities   // FF 3 million   // - Collective storage and marketing facilities  // FF 6 million  // Total  // FF 9 million   // GUADELOUPE  //   // - Cooperatives and private firms preparing fish for the market   // FF 10,4 million   // - Cooperative producing smoked fish   // FF 0,2 million  // Total  // FF 10,6 million  // GUYANA   //   // - Facilities for the treatment and storage of shrimps and fish   // FF 42,4 million   // - Facilities for the treatment and marketing of fishery products   // FF 9,3 million  // Total  // FF 51,7 million\nNATIONAL AIDS\nThe above investments are eligible for subsidies granted by the State, under economic planning contracts, and by the regions.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission finds that the programmes submitted by the French Government as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes constitute a suitable basis for facilitating the development of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nIn this connection, the Commission would point out that any expansion of the processing and marketing of fishery products must be compatible with the foreseeable trend in resources and with the consequences and the objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleet and for aquaculture (1).\n2. As regards the investments in the preservation and treatment of fish and shrimps in Guyana, bearing in mind the existing facilities, the situation as regards shrimp stocks, and the short-term sales opportunities for fish, the Commission expresses a reservation as to whether the full range of planned investments should be carried out and will not decide on any Community financing for individual projects until the economic viability of the latter has been examined.\n3. Given that the Community measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and for the development of aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, and since the Commission has still to decide on the coordinated fishery programmes for the Antilles and Guyana, the Commission reserves the right to review the present programme at a later date so that the structural measures planned for the fishing fleet and aquaculture for 1987 and subsequent years, together with any measures taken under the coordinated programmes, may be duly taken into consideration in relation to the processing and marketing of fishery products.\n4. The Commission would point out that the estimates of investments given in the programme do not predetermine the level of any Community financial aid.\n(1) OJ No L 157, 15. 6. 1985."}
