Objective and field of application\nThese guidelines should be used where detection of constituents of animal origin (defined as products from processing bodies and body-parts of mammals, poultry and fish) in feedingstuffs is carried out by means of microscopic examination.\nIn the case where the estimation of the quantity of animal constituents is carried out, the provisions under point 7 of these guidelines have to be followed.\n2. Sensitivity\nDependent on the nature of the constituents of animal origin, very small amounts (0,5 mm (or a representative part of the fraction) is applied as a thin layer to a suitable support and screened systematically under the stereomicroscope (5.4) at various magnifications for constituents of animal origin.\nSlides made with the sieve fraction(s) TABLE POSITION>\n7. Calculation and evaluation\nIn the case where the estimation of the quantity of animal constituents is carried out the provisions under this point have to be followed.\nThe calculation can only be made if the constituents of animal origin contain bone fragments.\nBone fragments of terrestrial warm-blooded species (i.e. mammals and birds) can be distinguished from the different types of fish bone in the microscopic slide by means of the typical lacunae. The proportion of constituents of animal origin in the sample material is estimated taking into consideration:\n- the estimated proportion (weight %) of bone fragments in the concentrated sediment, and\n- the proportion (weight %) of bone in the constituents of animal origin.\nThe estimate has to be based on at least three (if possible) slides and at least five fields per slide. In compound feedingstuffs, the concentrated sediment as a rule contains not only terrestrial animal bone and fish bone fragments, but also other particles of high specific weight, e.g. minerals, sand, lignified plant fragments and the like.\n7.1. Estimated value of the percentage of bone fragments\n% terrestrial bone fragments = >NUM>S\u00d7c >DEN>W\n% fish bone and scale fragments = >NUM>S\u00d7d >DEN>W\n(S= sediment weight (mg), c=correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of terrestrial animal bones in the sediment, d= correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of fish bones and scale fragments in the sediment, W=weight of the sample material for the sedimentation (mg)).\n7.2. Estimated value of constituents of animal origin\nThe proportion of bone in animal products can vary greatly. (The percentage of bone in the case of bone meals is of the order of 50 to 60 % and in the case of meat meals of the order of 20 to 30 %; in the case of fish meals bone and scale contents vary according the category and origin of fish meal, normally in the order of 10 to 20 %).\nIf the type of animal meal present in the sample is known, it is possible to estimate the content:\nEstimated content of constituents of terrestrial animal products (%) = >NUM>S\u00d7c >DEN>W\u00d7f \u00d7 100\nEstimated content of constituents of fish products (%) = >NUM>S\u00d7d >DEN>W\u00d7f \u00d7 100\n(S=sediment weight (mg), c= correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of terrestrial animal bone constituents in the sediment, d= correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of fish bones and scale fragments in the sediment, f= correction factor for the proportion of bone in the constituents of animal origin in the sample examined, W= weight of the sample material for the sedimentation (mg)).\n8. Expression of the result of the examination\nThe different cases could be reported in the following way:\n8.1. As far as was discernible under the microscope, no constituents of animal origin (as defined in point 1) were found in the submitted sample.\n8.2. As far as was discernible under the microscope constituents of animal origin (3) were found in the submitted sample.\nIn this case, the reporting of the result of the examination, if required, can be further specified as:\n8.2.1. As far as was discernible under the microscope, small amounts of constituents of animal origin (4) were found in the submitted sample.\n8.2.2. Dependent on the experience of the analyst:\n- either, as far as was discernible under the microscope, constituents of animal origin (5) were found in the submitted sample. The content of bone fragments (fish/terrestrial animals - in the case of bone fragments of terrestrial animals, eventually specified as bone fragments from poultry or mammalians, see remark 9.3) is estimated in an order of magnitude of . . .%, equal to . . .% of animal constituents when calculated on the basis of . . .% bone in the animal constituents' product (= correction factor f used),\n- or, as far as was discernible under the microscope, constituents of animal origin (6) were found in the submitted sample in measurable quantities.\nFor the cases under point 8.2, 8.2.1 and 8.2.2, when bone constituents from terrestrial animals are identified, the report shall contain the additional clause:\n'The possibility that the above constituents are derived from mammals cannot be excluded.`\nThis clause is not necessary in cases where the bone fragments from terrestrial animals have been specified as bone fragments from poultry or mammalians (see remark 9.3).\n9. Remarks\n9.1. It is recommended in the case of many and big constituents in the concentrated sediment to sieve the sediment into two fractions (i.e. use of a 320 \u00ecm sieve). The fraction with the big constituents can be examined as a paraffin oil preparation under a stereomicroscope with transmitted light. The fraction with the fine constituents must be examined under the compound microscope.\n9.2. The concentrated sediment obtained (6.2), can, if necessary, be divided further using a concentrating agent with a greater density.\n9.3. Dependent on the experience of the analyst, the distinction between constituents of mammalian or poultry origin can be made, making use of specific histological features, by which this distinction can be made.\n(1) OJ L 102, 15. 4. 1976, p. 1.\n(2) The reagents listed are commercially available, if no other indication is given.\n(3) The type of constituents found, for example bones (fish or terrestrial animals), meat constituents, etc. should be indicated here."}
