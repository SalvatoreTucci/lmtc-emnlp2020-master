Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre(3), provides for a processing aid for flax and hemp straw. These two products, intended for fibre production, have also been added to the support system for producers of certain arable crops and are therefore eligible for area aid.\n(2) Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999(4), amended by Regulation (EC) No 827/2000(5), the production of linseed and hemp seed on set-aside land is possible provided that such seed is intended for uses other than textiles. Article 25 of that Regulation stipulates that the raw materials listed in Annex I are not eligible for any other aid, in particular under intervention schemes intended to stabilise agricultural markets. In the case of hemp, the varieties used to produce fibre are the same as those used for other purposes, which may pose problems during controls aimed at verifying compliance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999. This is not a problem in the case of flax because the varieties are different. Under those circumstances hemp seed should be deleted from the list of raw materials which can be grown on set-aside land.\n(3) In addition, the new scheme for flax concerns flax intended for the production of fibre, which is a broader concept than the expression \"flax for textile use\" used hitherto in Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999. The terminology used in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 should therefore be adapted.\n(4) Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 stipulates that the raw materials listed in Annex II may be grown on land set aside on condition that they are intended for use in the manufacture of the end products listed in Annex III.\n(5) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 provides for the possibility of growing perennial plants such as Miscanthus sinensis on set-aside land. New information indicates that that plant can, after having been shredded, be used as litter for horses or for drying or cleaning plants, which is a non-food use which meets the objective of Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999.\n(6) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 should therefore be amended to introduce that new use for Miscanthus sinensis.\n(7) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
