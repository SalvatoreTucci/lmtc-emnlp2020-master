However, this form is not consistent with the United Nations Layout Key for Trade Documents and in practice its use causes some problems.\n(2) Therefore a new model form conforming to the United Nations Layout Key for Trade Documents should be drawn up. The form should also be accompanied by explanatory notes to help interested parties to draw it up uniformly and correctly.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 stipulates that the form should be filled in by mechanical or electronic means or by hand.
