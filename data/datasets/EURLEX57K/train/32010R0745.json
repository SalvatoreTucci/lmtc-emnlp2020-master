For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 69(6)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, the amounts calculated in accordance with Article 69(7) of that Regulation have been laid down in Annex III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(2).

Where a Member State implementing the single payment scheme decides to grant the support referred to in Article 68(1)(c), the amount notified to the Commission is to be included in the single payment scheme ceiling, as this support takes the form of an increase in the unit value and/or the number of the farmer\u2019s payment entitlements.\n(7) For Member States implementing, in 2010, the single
