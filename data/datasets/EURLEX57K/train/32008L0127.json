That list includes the active substances listed in the Annex to this Directive.\n(2) By Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007\u00a0(4) a new Article 24b was inserted into Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 to allow active substances for which there are clear indications that it may be expected that they do not have any harmful effects on human or animal health or on groundwater or any unacceptable influence on the environment, to be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC without detailed scientific advice from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) having been sought.\n(3) For the active substances listed in the Annex to this Directive the Commission examined in accordance with Article 24a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the effects on human, animal health, groundwater and the environment for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers, with the conclusion that those active substances satisfy the requirements of Article 24b of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004.\n(4) In accordance with Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the Commission has submitted draft review reports for the active substances listed in the Annex to this Directive to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, for examination. Those reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 October 2008 in the format of the Commission review reports. In accordance with Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the Commission is to request the EFSA to deliver its view on the draft review reports by 31 December 2010 at the latest.\n(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substances listed in the Annex to this Directive may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include in Annex I to that Directive the active substances listed in the Annex to this Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substances listed in the Annex to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives that have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 28 February 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 March 2010.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

On the basis of that evaluation, they shall determine whether the product satisfies the conditions set out in Article 4(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\nFollowing that determination Member States shall:\n(a) in the case of a product containing one of the active substances listed in the Annex as the only active substance, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 31 August 2015 at the latest; or\n(b) in the case of a product containing one of the active substances listed in the Annex as one of several active substances, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 31 August 2015 or by the date fixed for such an amendment or withdrawal in the respective Directive or Directives which added the relevant substance or substances to Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, whichever is the latest.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 1 September 2009.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 27.6.2002, p. 14.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 379, 24.12.2004, p. 13.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 246, 21.9.2007, p. 19.\nANNEX\nThe following entry shall be added at the end of the table in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EC:\nNo Common Name, Identification Numbers IUPAC Name Purity\u00a0(1) Entry into force Expiration of inclusion Specific provisions\n\u2018224 Acetic acid Acetic acid \u2265 980 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n225 Aluminium ammonium sulphate Aluminium ammonium sulphate \u2265 960 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n226 Aluminium silicate Not available \u2265 999,8 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n227 Ammonium acetate Ammonium acetate \u2265 970 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n228 Blood meal Not available \u2265 990 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n229 Calcium carbide Calcium carbide \u2265 765 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n230 Calcium carbonate Calcium carbonate \u2265 995 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n231 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide \u2265 99,9\u00a0% 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n232 Denathonium benzoate Benzyldiethyl[[2,6-xylylcarbamoyl]methyl]ammonium benzoate \u2265 995 g/kg 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n233 Ethylene Ethene \u2265 99\u00a0% 1 September 2009 31 August 2019 PART A\n234 Extract from tea tree\n234 Tee Tree Oil is a complex mixture of chemical substances.
