the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 91/666/EEC of 11 December 1991 establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(1), as last amended by Decision 1999/762/EC(2), and in particular Articles 7 and 9 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(4), and in particular Article 14 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) In conformity with Decision 91/666/EEC, the purchase of antigens is a part of the Community action to establish Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.\n(2) Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC details the quantities and subtypes of antigen of the foot-and-mouth disease virus to be stored in Community antigen reserves.\n(3) Forced by the epidemiological situation and following the advice of the World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Pirbright, United Kingdom, and the advice of an expert group established to review certain provisions of Directive 85/511/EEC(5), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the Community has made purchases of subtypes and quantities of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.\n(4) By Commission Decision 93/590/EC of 5 November 1993 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(6), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC(7), arrangements were made for purchase of A5, A22 and O1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.\n(5) By Commission Decision 97/348/EC of 23 May 1997 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(8), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC, arrangements were made for the purchase of A22-Iraq, C1 and ASIA1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.\n(6) By Commission Decision 2000/77/EC of 17 December 1999 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(9), arrangements were made for purchase of certain quantities of A Iran 96, A Iran 99, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.\n(7) By Commission Decision 2000/569/EC of 8 September 2000 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(10), arrangements were made for purchase of additional quantities of A22-Iraq, O1-Manisa, ASIA 1-Shamir, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.\n(8) It appears necessary to align Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC to the purchases made by the Community in the light of the epidemiological development.\n(9) It appears also appropriate to update the Annex to Decision 2000/112/EC detailing the distribution between antigen banks of antigen reserves established within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines and amending Decisions 93/590/EC and 97/348/EC.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC is replaced by
