It is also necessary to provide an obligation for the Member States to lay down the procedure for the possible renewal of the support, as well as a prior evaluation of supported actions.\n(4) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 describes the financial management of restructuring and conversion of vineyards, without however establishing specific provisions relating to the control of the operations. The operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards may in certain cases be subject to multiple on-the-spot checks without bringing an improvement of the administrative and financial costs they involve.\n(5) Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 lays down provisions relating to monitoring of the production potential only. Although the operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards are closely related to the operations relating to production potential, they are currently excluded from the application of that Article. In order to simplify the control system, it is necessary to establish rules concerning the verification of operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards similar to the current rules concerning the verification of production potential operations.\n(6) In order to simplify the verification of the operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards, provisions should be made for allowing, in addition to the use of graphical tools, the use of equivalent instruments which also allow identification, measurement and localisation of the parcel.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 4, first paragraph, point (d) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(d) The support for promotion and information lasts no longer than three years for a given beneficiary in a given third-country; however, if necessary, it may be renewed once, for a period no longer than two years;\u2019;\n(2) Article 5(1) is amended as follows:\n(a) the introductory phrase is replaced by the following:\n(b) point (e) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(e) evaluating any given supported action. In case of renewal in accordance with point (d) of the first paragraph of Article 4, the results of the supported actions shall in addition be evaluated prior to the renewal.\u2019\n(3) In Article 9(1), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n(4) Article 81 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 September 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0170, 30.6.2008, p.\u00a01."}
