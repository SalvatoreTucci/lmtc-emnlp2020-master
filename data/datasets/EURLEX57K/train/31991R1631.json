whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are in particular to secure a fair standard of living  for the agricultural community and to ensure that supplies are available and that they reach the consumers at reasonable prices;\nWhereas the target price for milk should bear a balanced relationship to the prices for other agricultural products and in particular to the prices for beef and veal, and be consistent with the desired general pattern of cattle farming; whereas it is  also necessary, in fixing that price, to take account of the Community's efforts to establish a long term balance between supply and demand on the milk market, allowing for external trade in milk and milk products;\nWhereas the intervention prices for butter and for skimmed-milk powders are intended to contribute to the achievement of the target price for milk; whereas it is necessary to determine price levels in the light of the overall supply and demand situation  on the Community market in milk and the opportunities for disposal of butter and skimmed-milk powder on the Community and world markets;\nWhereas the intervention prices for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5b of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, the Council, when fixing the target price for milk and the intervention prices, fixes a guarantee threshold for milk; whereas, however, the initial objective in fixing a guarantee threshold  is achieved inter alia by means of an additional levy on deliveries of milk or milk products which exceed the reference quantities determined;\nWhereas Article 68 of the Act of Accession has led to prices in Spain being set at a level differing from that of the common prices; whereas, pursuant to Article 70 (1) of the Act of Accession, the Spanish prices should be aligned with the common prices  at the beginning of each marketing year; whereas the criteria laid down for alignment lead to the Spanish prices being set at the level mentioned in Article 1 of this Regulation;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3639/90 of 11 December 1990 on the application in Portugal of the common price for butter (6) provides that the intervention price for butter applicable in Portugal is to be the common price decided for the 1991/92  marketing year; whereas, however, as regards skimmed-milk powder, it seems advisable to maintain unchanged the prices fixed for the 1990/91 marketing year in Portugal, on the mainland and the Azores,", "main_body": ["For the 1991/92 milk year, the target price for milk and the intervention prices for milk products shall be as follows:\n(ECU per 100 kg)\nCommunity\nof Ten\nSpain\nPortugal\n(a)\ntarget price for milk:\n26,81 (\u00b9)\n26,81\n26,81 (\u00b2)\n(b)\nintervention price:\nbutter\n292,78 (\u00b9)\n302,49\n292,78 (\u00b2)\nskimmed-milk powder manufactured using the:\n- spray method\n172,43 (\u00b9)\n202,67\n210,00 (\u00b2)\n- roller method\n163,81 (\u00b9)\n-\n-\nGrana Padano cheese:\n- between 30 and 60 days old\n379,67 (\u00b9)\n- at least 6 months old\n470,43 (\u00b9)\nParmigiano Reggiano cheese at least six months old\n519,21 (\u00b9)\n(\u00b9) For skimmed-milk powder manufactured in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic only.\n(\u00b2) 207 for the product manufactured in the Azores.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the beginning of the 1991/1992 milk year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 13 June 1991.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
