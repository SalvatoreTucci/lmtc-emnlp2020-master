Consequently, the final date for sowing arable crops for the 2001/02 marketing year should, where necessary, be deferred for certain specific regions. In order to do so, a derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 should be laid down as permitted by the eleventh indent of Article 9 of that Regulation.\n(3) In view of the health measures taken to combat foot-and-mouth disease in the Community, some producers have been obliged to allow grazing on arable land while not qualifying for aid for meat production for those areas. Provision should be made for a derogation from the flowering requirement for those areas laid down in Article 3(1)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 556/2001(4).\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The final dates for sowing for the 2001/02 marketing year are fixed in the Annex for the crops, Member States and regions indicated.", "The Member States may derogate, for area payments for the 2001/02 marketing year, from the requirement under Article 3(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 that crops be maintained until the beginning of flowering or until 30 June in duly justified cases for animal health protection reasons following outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to area payments for the 2001/02 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 16.6.1999, p. 1.\n(2) See page 16 of this Official Journal.\n(3) OJ L 280, 30.10.1999, p. 43.\n(4) OJ L 82, 22.3.2001, p. 13.\nANNEX\nFINAL DATES FOR SOWING FOR THE 2001/02 MARKETING YEAR\n>TABLE>"}
