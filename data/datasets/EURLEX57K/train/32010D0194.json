Consequently, this band is still occupied on an exclusive basis by mobile electronic communication equipment used for national security needs in Bulgaria.\n(3) By letter of 25 November 2009, the Republic of Bulgaria therefore requested the extension by one year of the transitional derogation granted by Decision 2009/1/EC. Bulgaria also provided a progress report on the implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC.\n(4) Bulgaria has provided sufficient justification to its request for an extension of the transitional derogation. Bulgaria has informed the Commission that in 2009, it took the necessary non-financial preparatory measures to assign new frequencies to the national security service in order to replace the 2\u00a0500-2\u00a0690\u00a0MHz band and that the necessary financial resources would be made available in 2010 for the deployment of the new mobile radio communication system to be used for national security purposes.\n(5) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee indicated at the Committee meeting on 10-11 December 2009 that they do not object to this extension of the transitional derogation.\n(6) The requested extension would not unduly defer implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC nor create undue differences between Member States with respect to competitive or regulatory situations. The request is justified and an extension of the transitional derogation by one year would be appropriate to facilitate the full implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2009/1/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, \u201831\u00a0December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831\u00a0December 2010\u2019 and \u201831\u00a0December 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u201831\u00a0December 2011\u2019;\n2. in Article 3, \u201816\u00a0January 2010\u2019 is replaced by \u201816\u00a0January 2011\u2019 and \u201816\u00a0January 2011\u2019 is replaced by \u201816\u00a0January 2012\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Bulgaria."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nNeelie KROES\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0163, 24.6.2008, p.\u00a037.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a02, 6.1.2009, p.\u00a06."}
