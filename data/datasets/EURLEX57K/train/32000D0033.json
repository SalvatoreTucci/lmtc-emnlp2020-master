The outcome for 1998 was slightly above the 2,4 % deficit target recommended by the Council for that year. Government investment expenditure, at 3,7 % of GDP in 1998, exceeded the government deficit for the first time. Fiscal adjustment in recent years was based on large and increasing primary surpluses while the interest burden declined progressively under the combined effect of lower interest rates and of the reduction in the government debt to GDP ratio. The deficit in 1999 is estimated at 1,9 % of GDP. According to the 1998 update of the Greek convergence programme submitted under the Stability and Growth Pact requirements, the general government deficit is expected to decline further to 0,8 % of GDP in 2001.\nThe general government debt reached a peak of 112,3 % of GDP in 1996; it was reduced by 6 percentage points in the following two years, to 106,3 % of GDP in 1998. The debt ratio is estimated at 104,5 % of GDP in 1999. According to the 1998 update of the Greek convergence programme, the debt ratio may decline to below 100 % of GDP in 2001. The Greek Government has confirmed its commitment to keeping the primary surplus at a level that contributes strongly to the decline of the debt ratio. This primary surplus is essential to maintaining the debt ratio on its sustainable downward path.\nThe deficit was below the Treaty reference value in 1998 and is expected to remain so in 1999 and to decline further in the medium term; the gross debt ratio is currently decreasing and is expected to be on a declining path in the coming years,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Greece has been corrected.", "The Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece is hereby abrogated.\nThis Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 1999.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.
