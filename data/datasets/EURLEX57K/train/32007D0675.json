The consultative group is to be known as the \u2018Experts Group on Trafficking in Human Beings.\u2019\u00a0(2).\n(2) The Experts Group on Trafficking in Human Beings was mandated to contribute to the further development of the prevention of and the fight against trafficking in human beings, to enable the Commission to gather opinions in view of Commission initiatives relating to trafficking in human beings and to prepare a report based on the recommendations set out in the Brussels Declaration.
