whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\nWhereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\nWhereas it appears that maximum residue limits cannot be established for dimetridazole because residues, at whatever limit, in foodstuffs of animal origin might constitute a hazard to the health of the consumer; whereas dimetridazole should therefore be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, the draft of the measures to be adopted was submitted to the Committee for the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Veterinary Medicinal Products Sector; whereas the Committee was not able to deliver an opinion; whereas the Commission therefore proposed the measures to be adopted to the Council;\nWhereas the Council did not act or vote against the proposed measures by a simple majority in the three-month period allowed; whereas it is therefore incumbent upon the Commission to adopt the measures,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 1995.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 143, 27. 6. 1995, p. 26.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nAnnex IV is amended as follows:\nList of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum levels can be fixed\n5.
