The Turks and Caicos Islands have the possibility to purchase rice, originating in the ACP countries of the region. Therefore the application of the existing rules of origin does not affect the ability of their industry to export rice to the Community. As a result, the requested derogation is not duly justified within the meaning of Article 30(1) of Annex II, and more in particular with regard to Article 30(3) and the cumulation provisions referred to in Article 30(4),", "main_body": ["The request submitted on 21 June 2000 by the Government of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Turks and Caicos Islands for a derogation from the definition of the concept of \"originating products\" with regard to its production of rice of CN code 1006 30, is hereby rejected.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 September 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik Bolkestein\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 263, 19.9.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 329, 29.11.1997, p. 50."}
