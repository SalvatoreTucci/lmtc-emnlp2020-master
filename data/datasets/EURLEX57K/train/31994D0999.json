By letter of 12 September 1994, the United Kingdom also submitted further information  in response to the Commission's request of 9 August 1994.\nIn accordance with Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission is required to take a decision on a  specific financial measure, namely aid for the year 1994 totalling \u00a3 230 000 granted to Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd to cover operating losses.\nThe financial support, proposed by Lothian Regional Council, falls within the scope of Article 1  (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\nThe Commission is therefore required to decide, in accordance with Article 9 of the Decision,  whether the support is in conformity with the objectives and criteria of the Decision and is  compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII By Decision 94/574/ECSC (2), the Commission gave a favourable opinion on the conformity of the  modernization, rationalization and restructuring plan notified by the United Kingdom with the  general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\nIn accordance with that same Decision, the Commission authorized the United Kingdom to carry over  to the final quarter of the 1993/94 financial year and to the 1994/95 financial year the provision  authorized until 31 December 1993 for sums totalling respectively 2 187 759,71 and \u00a3  116 354  577,43 so that the operating aid may cover the operating losses of underground coalmining  undertakings, which include Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd.\nBy notification of 13 July 1994, the United Kingdom submitted to the Commission the refinancing  plan of Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd. This plan aims to refinance the company and to open a second  work face which should improve productivity and lead to a reduction in the cost of production per  tonne.\nBy letter of 12 September 1994, the United Kingdom informed the Commission that Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd forecast a negative result in its operating account of \u00a3 1 115 554 for an estimated  amount of 520 000 tonnes of coal produced. This loss can be explained by the poor results in the  first half of the year before the technical and financial measures of the aforementioned plan had  been implemented.\nOperating aid totalling \u00a3 230 000 aimed at covering operating losses must be evaluated in  accordance with the aims of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and particularly with those set out in Article  2 (1). Given coal prices on the international markets, this support will enable Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd to make new progress towards economic viability and thus to stabilize in the  future. The support will also help to solve social and regional problems created by reductions in  the activity of production units in the Lothian area.\nThe proposed aid, together with that approved pursuant to Decision 94/574/ECSC, does not exceed,  for each tonne produced, the difference between production costs and the average foreseeable  revenue for the year 1994. It is therefore in compliance with the first indent of Article 3 (1) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\nThe coal produced by Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd will be largely bought by Scottish Power plc,  under a contract covering the period 1 April 1993 to 31 March 1998. The amount of operating aid per  tonne will not cause delivered prices for Community coal to be lower than those for coal of a  similar quality from third countries. The aid must not entail distortions of competition between  coal users. The United Kingdom supplied to the Commission the information required to calculate the  forecast costs of production and receipts per tonne. The information notified by the United Kingdom  Government has therefore allowed verification that the conditions of the third, fourth and fifth  indents of Article 3 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC are met in full.\nAid to cover operating losses at Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd aims to facilitate the modernization,  rationalization and restructuring plan of the British coalmining industry.\nIn the light of the foregoing and on the basis of the information supplied by the United Kingdom,  the proposed aid for current production at Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd is compatible with the  objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nIII In accordance with the second indent of Article 3 (1) and Article 9 (2) and (3) of Decision No  3632/93/ECSC, the Commission will ensure that the aid authorized for current production complies  with the aims set out in Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision. To this end, it must be informed of the  amount paid and how it is distributed,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized to grant Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd the sum of \u00a3 230 000.", "The United Kingdom shall inform the Commission, before 30 September 1995 of the amount  actually paid as a result of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 1994.\nFor the Commission Marcelino OREJA Member of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 329, 30. 12. 1994, p. 12.\n(2) OJ No L 220, 25. 8. 1994, p. 12."}
