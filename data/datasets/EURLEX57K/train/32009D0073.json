This value should be used in order for there to be absolute consistency between reports by installations and by Member States reporting their national emissions inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.\n(6) Decision 2007/589/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Decision 2007/589/EC\nDecision 2007/589/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n2. in the Table of Annexes, the following entry is added:\n\u2018Annex XIII:\n3.
