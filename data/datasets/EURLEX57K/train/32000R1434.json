The total estimated reimbursement is to be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amounts carried forward from previous marketing years.\n(3) Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the monthly reimbursement shall be fixed by the Council simultaneously with the derived intervention prices. The reimbursement laid down for 2000/01 should be used to calculate the levy.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77, the quantity in store to be taken into account for the reimbursement of any one month's storage costs is equal to the arithmetic mean of the quantities in store at the beginning and end of the month in question. For the 2000/01 marketing year, the quantities of Community sugar in store each month may be estimated on the basis of estimated stocks at the beginning of the marketing year, estimated monthly production and the quantities likely to be marketed for domestic consumption or exported during the same month. Total average monthly stocks during the 2000/01 marketing year can be estimated at approximately 86 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar. The total reimbursement for Community sugar can thus be estimated at approximately EUR 283 million for the 2000/01 marketing year. The balance of previous marketing years can be estimated at a positive amount of EUR 3 million. The detailed rules for the application of the system for offsetting storage costs for sugar provide that the levy is to be fixed per 100 kilograms of white sugar. The quantity of Community sugar which will be marketed during the 2000/01 marketing year for domestic consumption or for export may be estimated at approximately 14 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar. The levy for Community sugar should therefore be EUR 2,00 per 100 kilograms of white sugar.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["For the 2000/01 marketing year, the levy referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 shall be EUR 2,00 per 100 kilograms of white sugar.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 156, 25.6.1977, p. 4.\n(3) OJ L 361, 23.12.1978, p. 8."}
