That application is therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The person responsible for putting into circulation Kokcisan 120G submitted an application for authorisation for ten years, as a coccidiostat for chickens for fattening, according to Article 4 of that Directive. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the safety of the use of this preparation for human, animals and environment, under the conditions set out in the Annex to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation, as specified in Annex, should be authorised for ten years.\n(6) The assessment of this application shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additive set out in the Annex. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(3).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\u2019, as specified in the Annex, is authorised for use for ten years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States"], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
