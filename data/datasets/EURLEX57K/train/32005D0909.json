The modernised Eighth Directive on statutory audit of annual accounts and consolidated accounts and amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC\u00a0(1) (hereinafter referred to as modernised Eighth Directive) introduces, inter alia, a requirement for Member States to set up a system of public oversight for statutory auditors and audit firms. The modernised Eighth Directive aims also to establish co-ordination of public oversight systems at the community level and includes a possibility for the Commission to adopt implementing measures.\n(2) In order to reach the goals outlined in the modernised Eighth Directive, the Commission needs to call upon an expert group which would contribute to the co-ordination and the development of public oversight systems within the European Union. The group could also contribute to the technical preparation of the implementing measures of the modernised Eighth Directive.\n(3) The expert group should be composed of high level representatives drawn from the public oversight systems for statutory auditors and audit firms in Member States. If such systems are not yet established, representatives from the national ministries responsible for their establishment in the future should join the group. Only non-practitioners, as defined under Article 2(11)(b) of the modernised Eighth Directive, can be designated as representatives or alternate representatives because of the potential conflicts of interest between the profession and the private sector on one side, and the public interest on the other side. Nevertheless, the work of the Commission and of the group should draw upon the knowledge and experience of practitioners. As a result, the Commission should, after discussion with the expert group, consult extensively and at an early stage with market participants, consumers, the audit profession and end-users in an open and transparent manner, on the work of the group.\n(4) The expert group called the \u2018European Group of Auditors\u2019 Oversight Bodies\u2019 therefore should be set up and its terms of reference and structures detailed,", "main_body": ["The expert group called the \u2018European Group of Auditors\u2019 Oversight Bodies\u2019 hereinafter referred to as \u2018the group\u2019 is hereby set up by the Commission.", "Task\nThe Commission may consult the group on any question relating to the preparation of the implementing measures of the modernised Eighth Directive.
