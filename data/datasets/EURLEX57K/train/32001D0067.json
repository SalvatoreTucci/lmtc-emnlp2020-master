Part II of that list contains the third countries which are not yet covered by a specific Decision but which satisfy the requirements of Article 2(2) of Council Decision 95/408/EC(7), as last amended by Decision 2001/4/EC(8).\n(3) Under Decision 95/408/EC that list is valid until 31 December 2003, therefore the date of validity of certification should be amended to bring it in line with the date of validity of the provisional lists.\n(4) Furthermore, since Decision 97/296/EC provides that the import of aquaculture products shall only be authorised from countries also listed in Commission Decision 2000/159/EC(9), as last amended by Decision 2001/31/EC(10), the model of health certificate provided by Decision 95/328/EC should be amended to include the identification of the aquaculture products, when necessary. The model of health certificate should also be amended to bring it in line with the models of health certificates usually provided for fishery products imported from third countries covered by a specific Decision.\n(5) However, it is necessary to provide a transitional period for the updating of the model of health certificate.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
