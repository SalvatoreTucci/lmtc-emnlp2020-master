In order to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of those quotas, there should be no obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. Communication between the Member States and the Commission should, as far as possible, take place by electronic transmission.\n(7) From the entry into force of the Interim Agreement on 1 July 2008 until the final day of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009 introducing exceptional measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union\u2019s Stabilisation and Association process\u00a0(4), wine exports from Bosnia and Herzegovina took place within quota number 09.1515 set out in that Regulation.
