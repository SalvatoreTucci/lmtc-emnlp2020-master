For 1996 the Council had recommended that the deficit should be reduced significantly below 2,8 % of GDP: the deficit was actually lowered to 2,4 % of GDP, a level below the Treaty reference value. It is expected to decline to about 2,3 % of GDP in 1997. According to the updated convergence programme of the Netherlands the general government deficit may decline further to 1,5 % in 1998.\nGrowth dynamics and the decrease in the deficit have now put the government gross debt ratio on a downward path: from a peak of 80,5 % of GDP reached in 1993, the debt ratio fell to 78,5 % in 1996.\nThe deficit was below the Treaty reference value in 1996 and is expected to remain so in 1997 and to decline further in the medium term; the gross debt ratio is currently decreasing and is expected to be on an accelerated declining path in the coming years,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment it follows that the excessive deficit situation in the Netherlands has been corrected.", "The Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands is hereby abrogated.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 30 June 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
