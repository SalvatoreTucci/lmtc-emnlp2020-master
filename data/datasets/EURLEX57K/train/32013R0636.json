This feed additive was subsequently entered in the European Union Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 an application was submitted for a new use as a compound of trace elements for use for all animal species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 11 December 2012\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, methionine-zinc does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it may be considered as an effective source of zinc for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) In accordance with the characterisation of the additive by the Authority and the supplementary information by the applicant the appropriate name of the product is zinc chelate of methionine (1:2).\n(6) The assessment of that product shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that product should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The product specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018compounds of trace elements\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 213, 21.7.1982, p. 8.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 239, 30.8.1988, p. 36.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(1):3038.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nMaximum content of element (Zn) in mg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of nutritional additives.
