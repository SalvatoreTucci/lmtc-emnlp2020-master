Such zones were defined in Commission Directive 92/76/EEC of 6 October 1992, recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community(2) as last amended by Directive 2000/23/EC(3).\n(2) Since then, there have been significant developments in the plant health status of some of these zones initially recognised as protected zones in respect of the relevant harmful organisms.\n(3) From information supplied by Denmark it appears that it is no longer appropriate to maintain the protected zone recognised for Denmark in respect of Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations) and tomato spotted wilt virus.\n(4) Certain provisions on protective measures in Portugal against Gonipterus scutellatus Gyll. and in the United Kingdom and in Ireland against Pissodes spp. (European) should be modified to take into account the present distribution of these organisms in the respective countries.\n(5) From information supplied by United Kingdom and Sweden it appears that following local government reorganisation, the current description of the respective protected zones in respect of Dendroctonus micans Kugelan and Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say should be modified.\n(6) Under Directive 92/76/EEC, Austria, Ireland and the regions of Apulia, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia and Veneto in Italy were provisionally recognised as protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. for a period expiring on 31 March 2001.\n(7) From information supplied by Ireland it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zones for Ireland in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should be extended for a further limited period.\n(8) From information supplied by Austria and Italy it appears that some areas within Austria and Italy should not longer be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al., whilst other areas should be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. for a further limited period.\n(9) From information supplied by France it appears that some areas within France should not longer be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al.\n(10) From information supplied by United Kingdom it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zone for United Kingdom in respect of beet necrotic yellow vein virus should be extended for a further limited period.\n(11) It is therefore necessary to modify the existing designation of protected zones. In the interest of clarity, a new list of such zones should be adopted. Directive 92/76/EEC should therefore be repealed. In view of the continuing plant health problems, this Directive should enter into force and be transposed as soon as possible.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The zones in the Community listed in the Annex are hereby recognised as \"protected zones\" referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1)(h) of Directive 2000/29/EC, in respect of the harmful organism(s) listed against their names in the Annex.\nIn the case of point 2 of (b), for Ireland, for Italy (Emilia-Romagna: provinces of Forl\u00ed-Cesena, Parma, Piacenza and Rimini; Lombardia; Trentino-Alto Adige: autonomous province of Bolzano; Veneto), and for Austria (Burgenland, K\u00e4rnten, Nieder\u00f6sterreich, Osttirol, Steiermark, Wien), the said zones are recognised until 31 March 2002.\nIn the case of point 1 of (d), the said zone in United Kingdom is recognised until 31 March 2002.", "The extension of the recognition beyond the dates referred to in Article 1, and any amendment to the list of protected zones referred to in Article 1, shall be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 2000/29/EC, taking into account the results of appropriate surveys based on Community conditions and monitored by Commission experts.", "1.
