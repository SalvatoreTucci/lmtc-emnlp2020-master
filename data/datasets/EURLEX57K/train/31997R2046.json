The existence of such will may be demonstrated inter alia by ratification of the Single Convention of 1961 as amended by the Protocol of 1972, the Convention of 1971 and the Convention of 1988. Commitment on the part of developing countries shall take the form, inter alia, of the implementation of domestic legislation against laundering of money generated through illicit drugs.", "The assistance provided under this Regulation shall complement and reinforce assistance provided under other instruments of development cooperation.", "The Community shall give priority at the request of a partner country to supporting the preparation of a national drug control master plan, in close consultation with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). These plans will identify objectives, strategies and priorities in the campaign against drugs and the related resource requirements (including financial requirements), thus establishing an integrated, multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach designed to maximize the efficiency of national drug control programmes and international assistance.\nThe prevention of drug addiction, together with demand reduction, shall be addressed in a consistent policy comprising education and objective information about the consequences of addiction, targeted especially at young people.\nCommunity cooperation shall take place in a spirit of dialogue reflecting the genuine cultural differences which affect the perception of drug-related problems, this being crucial to ensure the social and political viability of drug control strategies.", "Preferably operating within the strategic framework established by the national plans, the Community shall also support specific operations capable of a measurable impact (i.e. effective and tangible results within a time-limit set in advance) in the following areas:\n- development of institutional capacity, in particular for the implementation of:\n- National Drug Control Plans by developing countries,\n- agreements between the Community and certain developing countries, in particular to combat the diversion of chemical precursors and to curb money laundering,\n- demand reduction, in particular through analysis of local patterns, the introduction of measures to control trade in and consumption of narcotics and psychotropic substances, treatment and reintegration of drug addicts, as well as risk limitation. These measures must be integrated into policies on health and education, development and combating poverty and social and economic exclusion,\n- promotion of pilot alternative development projects, conceived as a process by which the production of illicit drug crops is eventually both combatted and eliminated through appropriate rural development measures in the context of sustained national economic growth. These projects shall comprise social and economic measures which take into account factors contributing to illicit production as well as measures which may facilitate improved use of commercial preferences. In this connection, it shall be systematically examined whether it is possible to make more use of other Community financial instruments (e.g. ALA) and the European Development Fund for alternative development projects,\n- financing of studies, seminars and fora for the exchange of experience in the above fields.\nParticular attention shall be paid to the participation of local people and target groups in identifying, planning and carrying out operations.\nThe Community shall only finance projects in which respect for human rights is guaranteed.", "The cooperation partners eligible for financial support under this Regulation shall be regional and international organizations, in particular UNDCP, local- and Member State-based non-governmental organizations, national, provincial and local government departments and agencies, community-based organizations, institutes and public and private operators.", "1.

The Commission will ensure that the Community character of the aid provided under this Regulation is highlighted.\n7. In order to achieve the objectives of consistency and complementarity referred to in the Treaty and with the aim of guaranteeing optimum effectiveness of all these operations, the Commission may take all necessary coordination measures, including in particular:\n(a) a system for the systematic exchange and analysis of information on operations financed and those which the Community and the Member States propose to finance;\n(b) on-the-spot coordination of the implementation of operations through regular meetings and exchange of information between representatives of the Commission and of the Member States in the beneficiary country.\n8.
