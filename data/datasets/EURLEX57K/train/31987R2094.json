Physical quality criteria:\n(a) durum wheat of a sound, genuine and merchantable quality, free from abnormal smell and live pests, amber yellow to brown in colour, with a vitreous section of translucent, horny appearance;\n(b) total percentage of matter other than durum wheat grains of unimpaired quality: 25 %, of which:\n- percentage of durum wheat grains which have wholly or partly lost their vitreous aspect (mitadin\u00e9): 20 %,\n- percentage of broken grains: 2 %,\n- percentage of grain impurities: 2 % (''grain impurities\" means shrivelled grains, grains of other cereals, grains damaged by pests, grains showing discoloration of the germ, mottled grains, grains affected with fusariosis and grains overheated during drying),\n- percentage of sprouted grains: 0,5 %,\n- percentage of miscellaneous impurities: 0,5 % (\"miscellaneous impurities\" means extraneous seeds, damaged grains, extraneous matter, husks, ergot, decayed grains, dead insects and fragments of insects);\n(c) specific weight: 80 kilograms per hectolitre:\n(d) moisture content: 13 %.\n2. Technological quality criteria:\n(a) protein content (N \u00d7 5,7) not less than 12,5 % of dry matter;\n(b) gluten content not less than 8,75 % of dry matter;\n(c) Hagberg falling number not less than 250, including 60 seconds preparation (agitation) time.'\n2.

In the Annex, point 2 (d) is replaced by the following:\n'(d) Grains showing discoloration of the germ, mottled grains and grains affected with fusariosis. Grains showing discoloration of the germ are those of which the tegument is coloured brown to brownish black and of which the germ is normal and not sprouting. For common wheat, grains showing discoloration of the germ are disregarded up to 8 %.\nFor durum wheat,\n- mottled grains are grains which show brown to brownish black discoloration on parts other than the germ,\n- grains affected with fusariosis are grains whose pericarp is contaminated with Fusarium mycelium; such grains look slightly shrivelled, wrinkled and have pink or white diffuse patches with an ill-defined outline.'\n5.

Grains which have lost their vitreous aspect (mitadin\u00e9)\nMitadin\u00e9 grains of durum wheat are grains whose kernel cannot be regarded as entirely vitreous.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journl of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 July 1987.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 13 July 1987.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
