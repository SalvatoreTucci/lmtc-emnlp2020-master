Further information can be obtained from the IASB at www.iasb.org\nAmendments to IFRIC Interpretation 9\nReassessment of Embedded Derivatives\nParagraph 7 is amended. Paragraphs 7A and 10 are added.\nCONSENSUS\n7 An entity shall assess whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity first becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is either (a) a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract or (b) a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category, in which cases an assessment is required. An entity determines whether a modification to cash flows is significant by considering the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the embedded derivative, the host contract or both have changed and whether the change is significant relative to the previously expected cash flows on the contract.\n7A The assessment whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative on reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category in accordance with paragraph 7 shall be made on the basis of the circumstances that existed on the later date of:\n(a) when the entity first became a party to the contract; and\n(b) a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modified the cash flows that otherwise would have been required under the contract.\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n10 Embedded Derivatives (Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39) issued in March 2009 amended paragraph 7 and added paragraph 7A.

Similarly, if an entity is unable to measure separately the embedded derivative that would have to be separated on reclassification of a hybrid (combined) contract out of the fair value through profit or loss category, that reclassification is prohibited. In such circumstances the hybrid (combined) contract remains classified as at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety.\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n103J An entity shall apply paragraph 12, as amended by Embedded Derivatives (Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39), issued in March 2009, for annual periods ending on or after 30 June 2009."}
