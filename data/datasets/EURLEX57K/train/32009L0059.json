Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to enable the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2003/37/EC to be applied in respect of each type of tractor. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(3) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex II,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Tractor\u2019 (agricultural or forestry) means any motor vehicle, fitted with wheels or endless tracks and having at least two axles, the main function of which lies in its tractive power and which is specially designed to tow, push, carry or power certain tools, machinery or trailers intended for agricultural or forestry use.

The additional mirrors and rear-view mirrors designed in order to monitor the implements while working in the fields are not necessarily open to component type-approval but must be located in accordance with the setting requirements contained in points 2.3.3 to 2.3.5.\n1.2. \u2018Interior rear-view mirror\u2019 means a device as defined in point 1.1 which is fitted inside the cab or frame of a tractor.\n1.3. \u2018Exterior rear-view mirror\u2019 means a device as defined in point 1.1 which is mounted on any part of the external surface of a tractor.\n1.4. \u2018Class of rear-view mirror\u2019 means all rear-view mirrors having one or more common characteristics or functions. Interior rear-view mirrors are grouped in class I. Exterior rear-view mirrors are grouped in class II.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUIREMENTS FOR FITTING\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\n2.1.1. Tractors may be fitted with rear-view mirrors of classes I and II only bearing the EC type-approval mark laid down in Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices, amending Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Directive 71/127/EEC\u00a0(1).\n2.1.2. Rear-view mirrors must be fixed in such a way that they remain steady under normal driving conditions.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number\nAll tractors shall be equipped with at least one exterior rear-view mirror fitted to the left side of the tractor in Member States in which traffic drives on the right and to the right side of the tractor in Member States in which traffic drives on the left.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Position\n2.3.1. The exterior rear-view mirror must be so placed that the driver, when sitting on the driving seat in a normal driving position, has a clear view of that part of the road defined in point 2.5.\n2.3.2. The exterior rear-view mirror must be visible through the portion of the windscreen that is swept by the windscreen wiper or through the side windows if the tractor is fitted with them.\n2.3.3. The rear-view mirror must not protrude beyond the external bodywork of the tractor or the tractor-trailer combination substantially more than is necessary to obtain the fields of vision laid down in point 2.5.\n2.3.4. Where the bottom edge of an exterior rear-view mirror is less than 2 m above the ground when the tractor is laden, this rear-view mirror must not project more than 0,20\u00a0m beyond the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination measured without rear-view mirrors.\n2.3.5. Subject to the requirements of points 2.3.3 and 2.3.4, rear-view mirrors may project beyond the tractor\u2019s permissible maximum width.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjustment\n2.4.1. Any interior rear-view mirror must be adjustable by the driver from his driving position.\n2.4.2. The driver must be able to adjust the exterior rear-view mirror without leaving the driving position. The mirror may, however, be locked into position from the outside.\n2.4.3. The requirements of point 2.4.2 do not apply to exterior rear-view mirrors which, after being displaced, are returned automatically to their original position or can be restored to their original position without the use of tools.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fields of vision\n2.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States in which traffic drives on the right\nThe field of vision of the left hand exterior rear-view mirror must be such that the driver can see to the rear at least that level part of the road, as far as the horizon, which is to the left of the plane parallel to the vertical longitudinal median plane and which passes through the leftmost point of the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination.\n2.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States in which traffic drives on the left\nThe field of vision of the right hand exterior rear-view mirror must be such that the driver can see to the rear at least that level part of the road, as far as the horizon, which is to the right of the plane parallel to the vertical longitudinal median plane and which passes through the rightmost point of the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a025, 29.1.2004, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX II\nPART A\nRepealed Directive with list of its successive amendments\n(referred to in Article 6)\nCouncil Directive 74/346/EEC\nCouncil Directive 82/890/EEC Only the references made by Article 1(1) to Directive 74/346/EEC\nDirective 97/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Only the references made by the first indent of Article 1 to Directive 74/346/EEC\nCommission Directive 98/40/EC\nPART B\nList of time-limits for transposition into national law and application\n(referred to in Article 6)\nDirective Time-limit for transposition Date of application\n74/346/EEC 2 January 1976 \u2014\n82/890/EEC 22 June 1984 \u2014\n97/54/EC 22 September 1998 23 September 1998\n98/40/EC 30 April 1999\u00a0(1) \u2014\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0In conformity with Article 2 of Directive 98/40/EC:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 May 1999, no Member State may:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of tractor, to grant EC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC, or to grant national type-approval, or,\n\u2014 to prohibit the entry into service of tractors, if those tractors meet the requirements of Directive 74/346/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 October 1999, Member States:\n\u2014 may no longer issue the document referred to in the third indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 74/150/EEC for a type of tractor that does not meet the requirements of Directive 74/346/EEC, as amended by this Directive,\n\u2014 may refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of a type of tractor which does not meet the requirements of Directive 74/346/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\u2019,\nANNEX III\nCorrelation Table\nDirective 74/346/EEC Directive 98/40/EC This Directive\nArticle 1  Article 1\nArticle 2 Article 2\nArticles 3 and 4  Articles 3 and 4\nArticle 5(1)  \u2014\nArticle 5(2)  Article 5\n\u2014  Article 6\n\u2014  Article 7\nArticle 6  Article 8\nAnnex  Annex I\n\u2014  Annex II\n\u2014  Annex III"}
