For uses for which additional technical evidence had been provided demonstrating the essential need for further use of the active substance and the absence of an efficient alternative, temporary measures were provided to enable the development of alternatives.\n(2) Member States have presented new evidence demonstrating the need for further essential uses. Such information has been evaluated by the Commission with Member State experts. Derogations should be given only for cases which appear justified and which do not give rise to concern and should be restricted to the control of harmful organisms for which no efficient alternatives exist.\n(3) Certain active substances are covered both by the third and fourth stage of the programme of work because of their chemical relation or because of their specific use.
