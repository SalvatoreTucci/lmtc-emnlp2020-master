The following conditions shall be satisfied:\n(a) the wood shall be totally stripped of its bark by means of debarking, edging, grading and board selection and shall be free of grub holes. Bark is considered to be the external part of wood capable of sustaining live bark-inhabiting insects or other  harmful organisms at any stage of development, but does not extend to:\n- inner bark (bast),\n- ingrown bark, in particular around knots,\n- bark or pitch pockets as defined in the National Grading rules for softwood dimension lumber.\nGrub holes are understood to mean insect bore-holes caused by woodborers of the genus Monochamus, and defined for this purpose as those which are larger than 3 mm across;\n(b) the fact that the requirements laid down under (a) are satisfied shall have been checked by graders who are trained, qualified and authorized for that purpose under a programme approved and controlled by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service, US Department of Agriculture;\n(c) checks on compliance with the conditions laid down under (a) shall have been undertaken at mills by industry inspectors or their agents qualified and authorized for that purpose by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, US Department of  Agriculture. In addition, the checking system shall provide for inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, US Department of Agriculture, undertaking occasional pre-shipment inspections;\n(d) the wood shall be accompanied by a 'Certificate of Debarking and Grub Hole Control' which is standardized under the programme mentioned under (b), and complies with the specimen given in the Annex to this Decision, and which is issued by an  authorized person on behalf of mills to participate in that programme by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, US Department of Agriculture, and is filled in in accordance with the instructions set up under that programme.", "Without prejudice to Article 14 (5) of Directive 77/93/EEC, the Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of all cases of consignments introduced pursuant to this Decision which do not comply with the conditions  laid down under Article 1 (2) (a) and (d).", "The authorization granted in Article 1 shall apply from 1 June until 30 September 1993 being the last date of entry in the Community.
