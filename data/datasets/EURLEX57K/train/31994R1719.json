Article 32 (a) is replaced by the following:\n'(a) he shall not be authorized to transfer the said rights and/or to lease them temporarily during the three following calendar years. However, and in respect of 1993 and 1994, this provision shall not apply to the rights obtained by means of a  transfer and/or temporary lease during the calendar year in question before the notification of the allocation of rights from the national reserves relating to that same year.'\n2. Article 33 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 33\nUse of rights\nWithout prejudice to Article 32 and except:\n- in the case of producers participating in an extensification programme recognized by the Commission,\n- in the case of producers participating in an early retirement scheme recognized by the Commission in which the transfer and/or temporary lease of rights is not obligatory, or\n- in duly justified exceptional cases,\nwhere producers have not made use of at least 50 % of their rights during each of two consecutive calendar years, the part not used during the last calendar year shall be transferred to the national reserve.'\n3. In Article 34 (3), the final sentence is replaced by the following:\n'However, for producers participating in early retirement programmes or who have, prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1719/94 (amending Regulation), undertaken to participate in extensification programmes recognized by the Commission,  Member States may provide for an extension of the total duration of the temporary lease on the basis of these programmes.\nProducers who, subsequent to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1719/94 (amending Regulation), undertake to participate in an extensification programme in accordance with the measure referred to in Article 2 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No  2078/92 shall not be authorized to temporarily lease and/or to transfer their suckler cow premium rights throughout the period of their participation. However, this prohibition shall not apply:\n- in cases where the extensification programme permits the transfer and/or temporary lease of rights to producers whose participation in measures other than the extensification measure referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 requires the  acquisition of rights,\n- to producers able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that, prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1719/94, they had already notified those authorities of the transfer and/or temporary lease of premium rights in  accordance with paragraph 2.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 148, 28. 6. 1968, p. 24.\n(2) OJ No L 121, 12. 5. 1994, p. 9.\n(3) OJ No L 215, 30. 7. 1992, p. 85.\n(4) OJ No L 215, 30. 7. 1992, p. 91.\n(5) OJ No L 391, 31. 12. 1992, p. 20.\n(6) OJ No L 113, 4. 5. 1994, p. 1."}
