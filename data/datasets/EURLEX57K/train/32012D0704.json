By letter dated 11 April 2012, the Commission notified Lithuania that it had all the information that it considered necessary to consider the request.\n(3) Council Decision 2006/388/EC of 15 May 2006 authorising the Republic of Lithuania to apply a measure derogating from Article 21 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes\u00a0(2) authorised Lithuania, inter alia, to make the recipient liable for the VAT due on the supply of goods and services in the case of insolvency procedures or restructuring procedures subject to judicial oversight and supply of timber.\n(4) Council Implementing Decision 2010/99/EU of 16 February 2010 authorising the Republic of Lithuania to extend the application of a measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\u00a0(3) extended the application of the derogating measure provided for in Decision 2006/388/EC (\u2018the derogating measure\u2019).\n(5) The tax investigations and the analysis carried out by the Lithuanian tax authorities have revealed the effectiveness of the derogating measure.\n(6) The Commission understands that the legal and factual situation which has justified the application of the derogating measure has not changed and continues to exist. Lithuania should therefore be authorised to apply the measure during a further limited period.\n(7) In case Lithuania would consider another extension of the derogating measure beyond 2015, an evaluation report should be submitted to the Commission together with that extension request no later than 1 April 2015.\n(8) The derogating measure will have no adverse impact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Implementing Decision 2010/99/EU, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n\u2018It shall apply from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2015.
