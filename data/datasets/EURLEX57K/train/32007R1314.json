That Agreement has been approved by Council Decision 2007/566/EC of 23 July 2007 on the signing and the provisional application of an Agreement on the participation of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Economic Area and four related agreements\u00a0(2).\n(3) The EEA Enlargement Agreement of 2007 provides for an additional Protocol to the EC-Iceland Free Trade Agreement of 1972. This additional Protocol provides for new annual duty free tariff quotas at import into the Community of certain fish and fishery products originating in Iceland.\n(4) To implement the new tariff quotas it is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 499/96.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3) provides for a system of management for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of acceptance of the customs declarations. For reasons of simplification the same system should apply for the tariff quotas provided for in Regulation (EC) No 499/96.\n(6) The tariff quotas provided for in the additional Protocol should be regarded initially as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Therefore, Articles 308(c)(2) and (3) of that Regulation should not apply.\n(7) In accordance with the additional Protocol, the unused volume of the tariff quota for frozen Norway lobsters for 2007 should be carried over to the corresponding tariff quota for 2008.\n(8) In accordance with Decision 2007/566/EC the new tariff quotas have to apply from 1 September 2007. This Regulation should therefore apply from the same date and enter into force immediately.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 499/96 is amended as follows:\n1.
