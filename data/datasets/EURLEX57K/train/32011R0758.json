This number has not been changed since 1982, despite the reduction in the number of holdings in Ireland and an increase in the average size of holdings. Satisfactory representativeness should therefore be achieved on the basis of a smaller sample than the current one.\n(6) In the case of France, the addition of the new divisions Guadeloupe, Martinique and La R\u00e9union should be reflected and the number of returning holdings in each French division should be adjusted at levels that ensure satisfactory representativeness of the sample.\n(7) In the case of Hungary, the reduction of the number of divisions needs to be reflected.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is amended as follows:\n(a) the indent concerning Ireland is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 Ireland: EUR 8\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) the indent concerning France is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 France (with the exception of Guadeloupe, Martinique and La R\u00e9union): EUR\u00a025\u00a0000\n\u2014 France (only Guadeloupe, Martinique and La R\u00e9union): EUR 15\u00a0000\u2019;\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the 2012 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 27.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 24.12.2009, p. 14.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) the row concerning Ireland is replaced by the following:\n\u2018380 IRELAND 900\u2019\n(2) the rows concerning France are replaced by the following:\n\u2018FRANCE in 2012 from 2013\n121 \u00cele-de-France 200 190\n131 Champagne-Ardenne 370 370\n132 Picardie 270 270\n133 Haute-Normandie 170 170\n134 Centre 410 410\n135 Basse-Normandie 240 240\n136 Bourgogne 350 340\n141 Nord-Pas de Calais 280 280\n151 Lorraine 230 230\n152 Alsace 200 200\n153 Franche-Comt\u00e9 210 210\n162 Pays de la Loire 460 460\n163 Bretagne 480 480\n164 Poitou-Charentes 360 360\n182 Aquitaine 550 550\n183 Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es 480 480\n184 Limousin 220 220\n192 Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes 480 480\n193 Auvergne 370 360\n201 Languedoc-Roussillon 430 430\n203 Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur 430 420\n204 Corse 170 170\n205 Guadeloupe 65 80\n206 Martinique 65 80\n207 La R\u00e9union 130 160\nTotal France 7\u00a0620 7\u00a0640\u2019\n(3) the rows concerning Hungary are replaced by the following:\n\u2018HUNGARY\n764 Alf\u00f6ld 1\u00a0016\n767 Dun\u00e1nt\u00fal 675\n768 \u00c9szak-Magyarorsz\u00e1g 209\nTotal Hungary 1\u00a0900\u2019"}
