Accordingly, those amendments should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(8) Taking into account the number of amendments that need to be made to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009, it is appropriate to replace it by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2012.\nHowever, the amendments of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 concerning the deletion of entries of Capsicum annuum (crushed or ground), Curry (chilli products), Curcuma longa (turmeric) and Red palm oil for the possible contamination of Sudan dyes shall apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 11.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFeed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks\nHazelnuts 0802\u00a021\u00a000;
