UNSCR 1540 (2004) established binding obligations for all States which aimed to prevent and deter non-State actors from obtaining access to such weapons and weapon-related material. It also called upon States to present the Committee of the Security Council established by UNSCR 1540 (2004) (\u2018the 1540 Committee\u2019) with a report on steps which they have taken or intend to take to implement UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n(4) On 27 April 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1673 (2006) and decided that the 1540 Committee should intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through programmes of work, outreach, assistance, dialogue and cooperation. It also invited the 1540 Committee to explore with States and international, regional and sub-regional organisations the possibility of sharing experience and lessons learned, and the availability of programmes which might facilitate the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n(5) On 20 April 2011, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1977 (2011) and decided to extend the mandate of the 1540 Committee for a period of 10 years until 25 April 2021. It also decided that the 1540 Committee was to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States of UNSCR 1540 (2004), in particular on areas such as: (a) accountability, (b) physical protection, (c) border controls and law enforcement efforts and (d) national export and trans-shipment controls including controls on providing funds and services such as financing to such exports and trans-shipments.\n(6) The implementation of Council Joint Action 2006/419/CFSP of 12 June 2006 in support of the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) and in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction\u00a0(1) and Council Joint Action 2008/368/CFSP of 14 May 2008 in support of the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) and in the framework of the implementation of the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\u00a0(2) contributed to diminishing significantly the number of non-reporting States and the number of States which did not submit additional information required by the 1540 Committee following their submission of incomplete reports.\n(7) The Office for Disarmament Affairs within the United Nations Secretariat, which is responsible for providing the 1540 Committee and its experts with substantive and logistical support, should be entrusted with the technical implementation of the projects to be carried out under this Decision.\n(8) This Decision should be implemented in accordance with the Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement concluded by the European Commission with the United Nations concerning the management of financial contributions by the Union to programmes or projects administered by the United Nations,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which sets the objective of fostering the role of the UN Security Council and of enhancing its expertise in meeting the challenges of proliferation, the Union shall further support the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) (\u2018UNSCR 1540 (2004)\u2019) and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1977 (2011).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The projects in support of UNSCR 1540 (2004), corresponding to measures of the EU strategy, shall consist of sub-regional workshops, country visits, meetings, events, training and public relations efforts.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aims of the projects shall consist of:\n\u2014 enhancing the relevant national and regional efforts and capabilities primarily through capacity-building and assistance facilitation;\n\u2014 contributing to the practical implementation of specific recommendations of the 2009 Comprehensive Review of the status of implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004), in particular in the areas of technical assistance, international cooperation and raising public awareness;\n\u2014 initiating, developing and implementing National Action Plans upon States\u2019 request.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A detailed description of the projects is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (hereinafter \u2018the High Representative\u2019) shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The technical implementation of the projects referred to in Article 1(2) shall be carried out by the UN Secretariat (Office for Disarmament Affairs) (\u2018UN Secretariat (ODA)\u2019).

It is envisaged to support five country visits (each lasting 4 days). Depending on a specific country and decisions of the 1540 Committee, a country visit or country-specific activities will contribute to the national implementation process through: (a) contributions to awareness-raising by means of tailored dialogues with different actors involved in the national implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004); (b) examination of national measures and mechanisms used to implement that resolution and identification of specific challenges faced by the national authorities as well as possible options to remedy them; and (c) facilitation of the preparation of voluntary national action plans and other measures decided by the visited country.\nOrganisation by UNODA, in cooperation, as appropriate, with other international, regional and sub-regional organisations and entities, meetings in specific sub-regions based upon the outcome of the previous capacity-building workshops in the specific sub-regions. It is envisaged to conduct three follow-up meetings in the selected sub-regions (Africa, the Gulf and the Middle East, South East Europe and Latin America). Each meeting will be tailored to meet the actual requirements of the sub-region focusing on areas that are likely to achieve practical results. Meetings will be conducted in conjunction with in-country technical discussions to explore specific measures to sustain progress in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004). The in-country discussions will be organised in response to invitations by interested Member States.\nThe UN ODA will develop UNSCR 1540 (2004) activities in cooperation with other international organisations and agencies, including the OSCE, IAEA, OPCW, WHO, FAO and OIE, to ensure effective synergies and avoid duplication.\nAs appropriate, synergies will be sought with the activities of the regional Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) \u2018Centres of Excellence\u2019, which are currently being set up under the Instrument for Stability as well as with other EU-sponsored programmes in this field.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the measure\nImproved implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through additional steps to be undertaken by States towards its full implementation; development of effective and realistic national action plans or road maps for the implementation of the key requirements of that resolution; enhanced regional coordinated approaches to the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004); and the establishment of effective partnerships between participating States and assistance providers.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increased capacity-building to establish and maintain physical protection and accounting of sensitive dual-use materials\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objective of the measure\nTo promote capacity-building on national and regional levels to advance full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) by focusing on one of the resolution\u2019s key areas, namely, the physical protection and accounting of \u2018related materials\u2019. UNSCR 1540 (2004) contains specific provisions (operational paragraph 3, subparagraphs a) and b)) obliging all States to establish appropriate controls over materials, equipment and technology which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, States are required to: (a) develop and maintain appropriate effective measures to account for and secure such items in production, use, storage or transport; and (b) develop and maintain appropriate effective physical protection measures.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the measure\nOrganisation by UNODA of two sub-regional workshops (Central America, South East Asia and Latin America) focusing on the physical protection and accounting of \u2018related materials\u2019.
