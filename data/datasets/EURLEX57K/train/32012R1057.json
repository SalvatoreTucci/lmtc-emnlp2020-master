The tablets are added to water and carbon dioxide gas is produced during the dissolution process. This gas is usually generating ascending foam overflowing the drinking glass. The ascending foam needs therefore to be partly or completely suppressed by adding an anti-foaming agent to the effervescent tablet. Dimethyl polysiloxane (E 900) can be used as a more efficient alternative to the currently authorised polysorbates and sucrose esters of fatty acids.\n(6) The Report from the Commission on Dietary Food Additive Intake in the European Union\u00a0(3) concluded that dimethyl polysiloxane (E 900) needed no further examination, since the theoretical intake based on conservative assumptions on food consumption and additive usage did not exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (\u2018ADI\u2019). The ADI value of 1,5\u00a0mg/kg bw was established on 18 May 1990 by the Scientific Committee for Food\u00a0(4). The additional intake based on the new use as anti-foaming agent in food supplements in the form of effervescent tablets is estimated to be below 10\u00a0% of the ADI. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of dimethyl polysiloxane (E 900) in food supplements in the form of effervescent tablets.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of dimethyl polysiloxane (E 900) in food supplements in the form of effervescent tablets constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011\u00a0(5) the list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 applies in principle from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of dimethyl polysiloxane (E 900) in food supplements before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of that food additive.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0COM(2001) 542 final.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_32.pdf\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entry is inserted in the food category 17.1 \u2018Food supplements supplied in a solid form including capsules and tablets and similar forms, excluding chewable forms\u2019 after the entry for E 551-559:\n\u2018E 900 Dimethyl polysiloxane 10  only food supplements in effervescent tablet form Period of application:\n(79): Maximum level applies to the dissolved food supplement ready for consumption when diluted with 200\u00a0ml of water\u2019"}
