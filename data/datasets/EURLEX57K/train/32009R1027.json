It is pressed, uncooked, has a flat cylindrical shape, smooth faces and slightly rounded sides. Its rind is natural, smooth and homogenous, varying in colour from light grey to beige-orange. The interior is an ivory to pale yellow coloured paste, sometimes with small openings. It is supple, glossy and creamy, with a fine texture and a slight creamy flavour. Its most distinctive feature is a horizontal black furrow through the middle. Its weight varies from 5 to 8 kg, its diameter from 30 to 40 cm and its height from 5 to 8 cm. Its fat content (fat/dry matter) is at least 45\u00a0% and moisture content in the fat-free cheese (Fromage D\u00e9graiss\u00e9 (H.F.D.) is not more than 67\u00a0%.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nThe milk is produced and cheeses manufactured and matured in the geographical area comprising all the municipalities in the Doubs and Jura d\u00e9partements (except those in the canton of Chemin), 16 municipalities in the d\u00e9partement of Ain (municipalities of Apremont, Bellegarde-sur-Valserine in the part corresponding to the former municipality of Coupy, Belleydoux, Champfromier, Charix, Ch\u00e9zery-Forens, Confort, Echallon, Giron, Lancrans, Leaz, Lelex, Mijoux, Plagne, Montanges and Saint-Germain-de-Joux) and 13 municipalities in the d\u00e9partement of Sa\u00f4ne et Loire (municipalities of Beaurepaire-en-Bresse, Beauvernois, Bellevesvre, Champagnat, Cuiseaux, Flacey-en-Bresse, Fretterans, Joudes, Mouthier-en-Bresse, Sagy, Saillenard, Savigny-en-Revermont and Torpes).\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nThe dairy herd\u2019s basic feed must come from the natural pastures of the delimited area. Only milk meeting that criterion may enter the processing plants. Every milk producer, processing plant and maturing plant fills in a \u2018declaration of aptitude\u2019, which is registered with the INAO. Each operator must provide the INAO with a list of the operators in the production chain he has dealings with and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese. A yellow casein plate is used to identify the cheese. It is affixed at the time of production to the side of each cheese. The day and month of production are indicated. On the drum\u2019s label the identification of the maturing plant appears clearly (name or business name and address). Each undertaking, on a plant-specific basis, where appropriate, must return each month, duly completed, a statistical information sheet required by the \u2018Syndicat interprofessionnel de d\u00e9fense du Morbier\u2019 relating to the production and marketing of the \u2018Morbier\u2019 AOC (French \u2018controlled designation of origin\u2019) cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese produced and matured within the geographical area.\nThe milk used to produce Morbier cheese must come exclusively from cows of the Montbeliarde or French Simmental breeds. The cows are herded according to local custom. The grazing land actually used on the holding must be at least one hectare per dairy cow. The staple feed of the dairy cows must be fodder originating from pastures located in the geographical area. The dairy cows are not at any time of the year given any silage products or other fermented fodder, such as fodder preserved in the form of banded bales. Morbier cheese is made exclusively from cow\u2019s milk used in the raw state. With the exception of partial skimming, the addition of rennet, lactic starters or salt (sodium chloride), nothing may be removed or added to the milk. After being heated to a temperature not exceeding 40\u00a0\u00b0C, the milk is treated with rennet. The curd is cut into grains of about 1 cm thick. Water may be added to clean the curd. After the whey is drawn off, the curd is slightly pressed to obtain cakes. Each cake is cut in half. The horizontal central black furrow is obtained exclusively by coating the face of half a cake with charcoal (carbo medicinalis vegetalis) before pressing. Ripening takes place over a minimum period of 45 days from the day of manufacture, at a temperature of between 7\u00a0\u00b0C and 15\u00a0\u00b0C. The rind is obtained exclusively by rubbing with salt water, to which lactic starters may be added. The use of colouring agents is prohibited.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\n\u2018Morbier\u2019 cheese is named after the municipality of Morbier situated in the d\u00e9partement of Jura in Franche-Comt\u00e9, approximately 15 kilometres from the Franco-Swiss border. There is evidence of its production dating back to the 18th century when it was very much a local product, essentially in the Jura d\u00e9partement. Originally it was primarily farmhouse-made but later it was produced by \u2018fruiti\u00e8res\u2019 (cheese cooperatives) in the Jura massif area. Already in 1942 a decree laid down that \u2018Morbier\u2019 cheese was manufactured in the d\u00e9partements of Jura and Doubs.\nMorbier cheese is produced in the high pastures of the Jura mountains where the natural floral diversity of the grasses has allowed milk and cheese exhibiting highly valued and distinctive characteristics to be produced. The production procedures are defined in such a way as to ensure that the region\u2019s distinctive features are preserved and find their expression in the product.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName: Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress: 51 rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris, FRANCE\nTel. +33 153898000\nFax +33 153898060\nE-mail: info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut national des appellations d\u2019origine is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the French Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName: Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress: 59 boulevard Vincent Auriol, 75703 Paris Cedex 13, FRANCE\nTel. +33 144871717\nFax +33 144973037\nThe DGCCRF is a d\u00e9partement of the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nAll cheeses with the registered designation of origin \u2018Morbier\u2019 must bear a label showing the PDO name in a font two thirds the size of the largest font used on the label and displaying the words \u2018Appellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2019 (Registered Designation of Origin).
