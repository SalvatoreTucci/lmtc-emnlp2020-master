Community of certain textile products of category 33 specified in the Annex hereto and originating in the Republic of Indonesia (herein after referred to as 'Indonesia') have exceeded the level referred to in Article 10 (1) in  conjunction with Annex IX of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93;\nWhereas, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, Indonesia was notified on 24 February 1994 of a request for consultations concerning imports into the Community of textile products of category 33;\nWhereas, pending a mutually satisfactory solution, imports into the Community of products falling within category 33 were submitted to a provisional quantitative limit for the period of 24 February to 23 May 1994 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 811/94  (3);\nWhereas, as a result of the consultations with Indonesia, it was agreed that Indonesia, as of 24 February 1994, shall limit its exports to the Community of the textiles products in question for the years 1994 and 1995 and that the provisions of the  Agreement on trade in textile products between the Community and Indonesia, which concern exports of products subject to the quantitative limits established in Annex II to the Agreement and in particular those relating to the double checking system,  would be applicable to those products;\nWhereas it is therefore appropriate to confirm that

off against the quantitative limit fixed for the period 24 February to 31 December 1994;\nWhereas the quantitative limit for imports of products within category 33 should not prevent the importation of products covered by it shipped from Indonesia before the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 811/94;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee,", "main_body": ["Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2, imports into the Community of the category of products originating in Indonesia and specified in
