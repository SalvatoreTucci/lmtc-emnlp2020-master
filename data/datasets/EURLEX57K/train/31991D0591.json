whereas these derogations are subject to approval, under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 14 (2) and must also comply with the conditions laid down in Annex IV, part A (24);\nWhereas in Italy the growing of potatoes of the Sieglinde variety has been an established practice; whereas part of the supply of seed potatoes of this variety has been ensured by imports from Poland;\nWhereas derogations provided for by Italy have already been approved for the last four seed-potato marketing seasons, by Commission Decisions 88/177/EEC (3), 88/632/EEC (4) 89/606/EEC (5) and 90/613/EEC (6) based on the concept of 'closed zones; subject  to certain technical conditions to prevent the risk of harmful organisms spreading;\nWhereas Italy has stated that it intends to provide for derogations for the current seed-potato marketing season;\nWhereas it is known that Poland is still not free from potato spindle tuber viroid or from Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas Poland has developed a programme to eradicate these harmful organisms on a regional basis; whereas there are good reasons to believe that the programme to eradicate these harmful organisms has become fully effective, at least in certain 'closed  zones' (strefy zamkniete) of the voiedvodship of Lomza;\nWhereas there have been no findings of the diseases on samples drawn from seed potatoes imported pursuant to Decision 90/613/EEC; whereas Poland informed the Commission that the seed potatoes of the variety Sieglinde grown in 1991 in the aforementioned  'closed zones' originate from a Member State where Corynebacterium sepedonicum is not known to occur, and have been officially certified under Council Directive 66/403/EEC (7), as last amended by Directive 91/217/EEC (8); whereas, however, it has not  been established, on the basis of available information collected during a mission carried out in Poland in 1990, that there are elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'closed zones' and therefore  against the recognition of the provisions implemented as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating Corynebacterium sepedonicum;\nWhereas it can therefore be established that there is no risk of the harmful organisms in question spreading, provided that the seed potatoes originate in such zones and that certain special technical conditions are complied with;\nWhereas the Commission will ensure that Poland makes all technical information available which is necessary to monitor the protective measures required under the aforementioned conditions, and to assess the development of the Polish eradication  programme;\nWhereas therefore derogations provided for by Italy, should now be approved for the current potato marketing season, provided that they include the aforementioned conditions and without prejudice to Directive 66/403/EEC and to Council Directive  70/457/EEC (9), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (10);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 90/613/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, '1 June 1991' is replaced by '1 June 1992';\n2. in Article 3, '15 October 1990 until 31 March 1991', is replaced by '15 October 1991 until 31 March 1992';\n3. in Article 3, '31 March 1991' is replaced by '31 March 1992';\n4. in the Annex under (b),\n'The seed potatoes shall have been produced exclusively from seed potatoes of the \"Elite\" category, supplied by the official Plant Improvement Station of Lubleno in the voievoidship of Gdansk.' is replaced by\n'The seed potatoes shall have been produced exclusively from seed potatoes of the \"Elite\" category, imported from a Member State where Corynebacterium sepedonicum is not known to occur.';\n5. in the Annex, under (g), '15 April 1991' is replaced by '15 April 1992'.", "This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 1991.
