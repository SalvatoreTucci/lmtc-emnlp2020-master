Other changes should be introduced in those annexes to ensure consistency between the provisions on information documents laid down in Directives 2000/25/EC, 97/68/EC and 2003/37/EC. In addition, Annex III to Directive 2000/25/EC needs to be adapted in order to add the alternative type-approvals to be recognised for the new stages III A, III B and IV.\n(4) It is also necessary to adapt Annex I to Directive 2003/37/EC in order to ensure consistency between the provisions on information documents laid down in Directives 2000/25/EC, 97/68/EC and 2003/37/EC. In particular, discrepancies in terminology should be eliminated in the interests of clarity.\n(5) Directives 2000/25/EC and 2003/37/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 2000/25/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
