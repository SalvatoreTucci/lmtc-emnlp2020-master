Neutral methacrylate copolymer is intended to be used as a sustained-release glazing agent. Sustained-release formulations allow the continuous dissolution of a nutrient over a defined time. Anionic methacrylate copolymer is intended to be used as a glazing agent to protect the stomach against irritating ingredients and/or to protect sensitive nutrients against disintegration by the gastric acid. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of both food additives in solid food supplements and to assign E 1206 as E-number to Neutral methacrylate copolymer and E 1207 as E-number to Anionic methacrylate copolymer.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011\u00a0(6) authorised the use of Basic methacrylate copolymer (E 1205) in solid food supplements and Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 sets out the specifications for that food additive, including the maximum levels for arsenic, lead, mercury and copper. Those specifications should be updated to take into account the maximum levels for lead, mercury and cadmium in food supplements as set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(7).\n(8) Maximum level of arsenic in food supplements has not been set at the Union level. However, specific levels are laid down in the laws of Member States. Therefore, it is appropriate to update specifications of Basic methacrylate copolymer (E 1205) in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 as regards arsenic to take into account the laws of Member States.\n(9) Maximum level of copper in food supplements has not been set at the Union level and there is no indication of copper presence at toxicologically significant levels in Basic methacrylate copolymer (E 1205). It is therefore appropriate to delete copper from the purity section for Basic methacrylate copolymer (E 1205) in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.\n(10) Specifications should be adopted for Neutral methacrylate copolymer (E 1206) and Anionic methacrylate copolymer (E 1207). The purity criteria for arsenic, lead, mercury and cadmium should follow the same approach as those for Basic methacrylate copolymer (E 1205) and the maximum levels should take into account that the commercial form of Neutral methacrylate copolymer (E 1206) and Anionic methacrylate copolymer (E 1207) is a 30\u00a0% dispersion of the dry substance in water.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(7):1655.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(7):1656.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 364, 20.12.2006, p. 5.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Part B, the following entries for E 1206 and E 1207 are inserted in point 3 \u2018Additives other than colours and sweeteners\u2019, after the entry for E 1205 Basic methacrylate copolymer:\n\u2018E 1206 Neutral methacrylate copolymer\nE 1207 Anionic methacrylate copolymer\u2019\n(2) In Part E, the following entries are inserted in food category 17.1 \u2018Food supplements supplied in a solid form including capsules and tablets and similar forms, excluding chewable forms\u2019, after the entry for E 1205 Basic methacrylate copolymer:\n\u2018E 1206 Neutral methacrylate copolymer 200\u00a0000\nE 1207 Anionic methacrylate copolymer 100\u00a0000\u2019\nANNEX II\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) The purity section of the entry for E 1205 (Basic methacrylate copolymer) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Purity\nLoss of drying Not more than 2,0\u00a0% (105\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u00a0h)\nAlkali value 162-198\u00a0mg KOH/g of dried substance\nSulphated ash Not more than 0,1\u00a0%\nResidual monomers Butylmethacrylate < 1\u00a0000\u00a0mg/kg\nSolvent residues propan-2-ol < 0,5\u00a0%\nArsenic Not more than 1\u00a0mg/kg\nLead Not more than 3\u00a0mg/kg\nMercury Not more than 0,1\u00a0mg/kg\nCadmium Not more than 1\u00a0mg/kg\u2019\n(2) The following entries for E 1206 and E 1207 are inserted after the entry for E 1205 (Basic methacrylate copolymer):\nSynonyms Ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate polymer; Ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate polymer; Ethyl acrylate, polymer with methyl methacrylate; Methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate polymer; Methyl methacrylate, polymer with ethyl acrylate\nDefinition Neutral methacrylate copolymer is a fully polymerised copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate.
