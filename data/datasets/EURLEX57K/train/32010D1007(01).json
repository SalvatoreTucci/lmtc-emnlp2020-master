Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 specifies that these programmes shall cover all the activities needed to define, develop, validate, construct, operate, renew and improve the EGNOS system and the system established under the Galileo programme.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, the Commission is responsible for the management of those programmes. The management tasks include the renewal and improvement of the systems through refinement of the mission profiles and implementation of the related system changes.\n(3) The objective of the two systems is to provide users with a state-of-the-art positioning, navigation and timing service in accordance with the specified mission requirements for Galileo and EGNOS. Any refinement of the mission profiles of the two systems should take full account of the views of the navigation satellite systems user communities and other stakeholders, including those of the Member States, third countries and international organisations.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts to provide independent advice to the Commission on EGNOS and Galileo mission evolution matters and to define its tasks and its structure.\n(5) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 29 November 2001 amending its internal Rules of Procedure\u00a0(2).\n(6) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(7) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision.
