Moreover, the point of discharge is situated outside the outer limit of the Tagus estuary. Consequently, the criteria for less sensitive areas are applicable to the point of discharge.\n(7) The point of discharge is far away from the bathing areas of the Estoril coast.\n(8) The documentation transmitted by Portugal demonstrates that the discharge will not have any impact on the dissolved oxygen rate, the trophic status, the transparency and the benthic community of the receiving waters.\n(9) The bathing waters along the agglomeration of the Estoril coast have not, for years, complied with the requirements of Council Directive 76/160/EEC of 8 December 1975 concerning the quality of bathing water(3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, inasmuch as the microbiological concentrations in those waters exceed the standards specified in that Directive.\n(10) Since 1995, seven of the twelve bathing areas of the agglomeration of the Estoril coast, namely the beaches of Carcavelos, Parede, Rainha, Cresmina, S. Pedro de Estoril, Tamariz and Torre, have not complied with the mandatory bacteriological values of Directive 76/160/EEC.\n(11) The Commission considers that, even if the deficiencies of collecting systems appear to be the major source of this microbiological pollution, the waste water discharge in question can reach bathing areas and therefore contribute to the microbiological pollution of those areas unless waste waters are treated appropriately before discharge.\n(12) Microbiological removal treatment, prior to discharge into the sea, is necessary to prevent the risk of pollution of bathing waters.\n(13) In order to be efficient, microbiological removal treatment needs low levels of suspended solids and reduced concentration of organic matter in waste waters.\n(14) After consultation of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 18 of Directive 91/271/EEC and discussion with the Commission, Portugal sent additional documentation on 21 December 2000, proposing microbiological removal treatment after advanced primary treatment and before discharge into the sea during the bathing season.\n(15) The Commission considers that, on the basis of the information and assurances provided by Portugal and because of the exceptional circumstances concerning dilution and dispersion of the receiving waters, the treatment proposed by Portugal will be able to protect the adjacent bathing areas from microbiological contamination.\n(16) The Commission, having examined the documentation submitted by Portugal in support of the request for a derogation, concludes that the request corresponds to the circumstances envisaged by Article 8(5) of the Directive: the documentation demonstrates that the discharge from the Estoril coast agglomeration would, after the proposed treatment, not adversely affect the environment, and that more advanced treatment would not produce any environmental benefits.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Article 18 of Directive 91/271/EEC,", "main_body": ["The request by Portugal of 16 June 1999 under Article 8(5) of Directive 91/271/EEC, to be permitted to provide, for the agglomeration of the Estoril coast, less stringent waste water treatment than that prescribed in Article 4 of that Directive is accepted under the conditions set out in Articles 2 to 6 of this Decision.", "During the bathing season, defined by Portugal for the purposes of Directive 76/160/EEC as running from 1 June to 30 September, the urban waste water from the agglomeration of the Estoril coast shall, prior to discharge into the sea, be at least subject to advanced primary treatment and to a disinfection system in accordance with the requirements set out in heading 1 of the Annex of this Decision.", "Outside the bathing season, the urban waste water from the agglomeration of the Estoril coast shall, prior to discharge, be at least subject to primary treatments defined by Article 2(7) of Directive 91/271/EEC.", "The competent Portuguese authority or appropriate body shall monitor the discharge in accordance with the provisions set out in heading 2 of the Annex to this Decision.", "Acting in accordance with Article 15(3) of Directive 91/271/EEC, Portugal shall monitor and carry out other relevant studies to verify that the discharge does not adversely affect the environment.\nIn particular, at least twice a month during the bathing season, samples shall be taken in at least two well-defined points of the receiving waters, one point being located above the eastern diffuser of the discharge and the other one at 200 metres to the west of the western diffuser. At each of these two points, one sample shall be taken at surface level and another at middle depth: of these samples, 80 % shall contain not more than 100 faecal coliforms per 100 millilitres, the analysis being performed by a laboratory having a system of analytical quality control as specified in heading 2 of the Annex to this Decision.", "By 30 April of each year, commencing on 30 April 2002, Portugal shall provide the Commission with a report containing the results of the monitoring carried out during the previous calendar year, according to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5, as well as the results of the monitoring for the same year of the bathing waters situated in the area of the Estoril coast agglomeration, according to the provisions of Directive 76/160/EEC.\nThe report shall also include explanations of any failure to meet the requirements of this Decision or those of Directive 76/160/EEC.", "During the year 2006, the Commission shall re-evaluate the situation and shall, if necessary, submit a proposal to the Committee set up under Article 18 of Directive 91/271/EEC, no later than 31 December 2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p. 40.\n(2) OJ L 67, 7.3.1998, p. 29.\n(3) OJ L 31, 5.2.1976, p. 1.\nANNEX\n1.
