Those methods should be adapted to technical progress.\n(2) The ISO method 11890-2 was revised by the International Standards Organization in 2006 and the new version should be integrated into Annex III to Directive 2004/42/EC.\n(3) ISO method 11890-2 states that where reactive diluents are not part of the formulation of the product and where the VOC content is equal to or greater than 15\u00a0% by mass, the simpler and less expensive ISO method 11890-1 is an acceptable alternative. That method should, therefore, be permitted by Directive 2004/42/EC so as to reduce the testing costs for the Member States and economic operators affected by that Directive.\n(4) Directive 2004/42/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 12(3) of Directive 2004/42/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2004/42/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 10 June 2012 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
