The fee shall be based on ex-factory prices where the product that has been awarded the EU Ecolabel is a good. The fee shall be based on delivery price where it is related to services.\nThe maximum annual fee shall be EUR 25\u00a0000 per product group per applicant.\nIn the case of SMEs, micro-enterprises or applicants from developing countries, the annual fee shall be reduced by at least 25\u00a0%.\nThe annual fee does not cover the cost of testing, verification and any on-site inspections that may be required.
