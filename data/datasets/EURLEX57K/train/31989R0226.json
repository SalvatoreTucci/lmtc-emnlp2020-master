Homogeneous and representative samples of the meat product must be prepared for the purposes of analysis.\n1.2. Analytical methods to be used are as follows:\n1.2.1. nitrogen: Determination of the nitrogen content in meat and meat products \u2014 Kjeldahl method,\n1.2.2. moisture: Determination of the moisture content in meat and meat products \u2014 ISO 1442 \u2014 1973,\n1.2.3. fats: Determination of the total fat content in meat and meat products \u2014 Extraction with light petroleum after hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid,\n1.2.4. ash: Determination of the ash content in meat and meat products \u2014 ISO 936 \u2014 1978.\n1.3. The abovementioned ISO standard requirements concerning sampling are not binding for the purposes of the present Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of the overall meat content\nThe overall meat content in a product is calculated by means of the following formula:\n% of defatted meat\n% meat total = DM + F\nwhere\nNT = nitrogen determined by analysis (%)\nNx = nitrogen of non-meat origin (%)\nf = average nitrogen content (%) in the fat-free meat contained in the product; the value of this factor is 3,5 for any kind of meat and mixtures of meat with the exception of:\n\u2014 products whose meat content consists solely of tongue for which the value of this factor is 3,0,\n\u2014 products whose meat content consists solely of kidney for which the value of this factor is 2,7\nF = quantity of extractable fat (%) determined by analysis.\nThe total nitrogen and extractable fat content is determined by the methods mentioned in paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.3. It is also possible to assess the ash (1.2.4) and moisture (1.2.2) content and to obtain, by deduction, the other ingredients.\nIn order to correct the value of nitrogen of non-meat origin (Nx factor), it would be necessary to know the quantity of each ingredient containing nitrogen as well as the nitrogen content of these ingredients.\nThe following table shows the nitrogen content of several typical ingredients of non-meat origin containing nitrogen, which are generally found in meat products:\nNon-meat products % of nitrogen\nRusk 2,0\nCasein 15,8\nSodium caseinate 14,8\nSoya isolate 14,5\nTextured soya 8,0\nSoya flour 8,0\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) 8,3\nAs far as repeatability of analytical procedure is concerned, reference should be made to the relevant ISO standard.\nThe average result of at least two determinations must be taken into account."}
