Annex I VII (C) is amended as follows:\n1. In point 1 in the 8th indent '5g' is replaced by '7g'.\n2. After point 3 the following new point 4 is inserted:\n'4. Use of Membrane filters\nEach polycarbonate membrane filter may be used no more than five times. The filter should be turned between each use. In addition the filter should be checked after each use for any damage which would make it unsuitable for further use.'\n3. Point 4 becomes number 5, and number 5 becomes number 6.\nB. Annex IV is amended as follows:\n1. After the heading 'The freezing of meat' the new subtitle 'I. Method 1' is inserted.\n2. After the 7th paragraph the following text is added:\n'II. Method 2\nThe general provisions of paragraphs 1 to 5 of method 1 shall be complied with, and the following time-temperature combinations applied:\n1. Meat with a diameter or thickness of up to 15 cm must be frozen according to one of the following time-temperature combinations:\n- 20 days at   15 \u00b0C,\n- 10 days at   23 \u00b0C,\n- 6 days at   29 \u00b0C.\n2. Meat with a diameter or thickness of between 15 cm and 50 cm must be frozen according to one of the following time-temperature combinations:\n- 30 days at   15 \u00b0C,\n- 20 days at   25 \u00b0C,\n- 12 days at   29 \u00b0C.\nThe temperature in the refrigeration room must be no higher than the level of the selected inactivation temperature. It should be measured with calibrated thermoelectric instruments and continuously recorded. It may not be measured directly in the cold  air flow. The instruments must be kept under lock. The charts must include the relevant numbers from the meat inspection register on importation and the date and time of the commencement and completion of freezing, and must be retained for one year  after compilation.\nIII. Method 3\nControl of the temperature at the center of the meat pieces.\n1. The following time-temperature combinations shall be applied where the temperature is controlled at the center of the meat pieces and the conditions in paragraphs 2 to 6 are fulfilled:\n- 106 hours at   18 \u00b0C,\n- 82 hours at   21 \u00b0C,\n- 63 hours at   23,5 \u00b0C,\n- 48 hours at   26 \u00b0C,\n- 35 hours at   29 \u00b0C,\n- 22 hours at   32 \u00b0C,\n- 8 hours at   35 \u00b0C,\n-  hour at   37 \u00b0C.\n2. Meat brought in already frozen must be kept in this condition.\n3. Consignments in the refrigeration room must be kept separately and under lock.\n4. The date and time when each consignment is brought into the refrigeration room must be recorded.\n5. The technical equipment and energy supply of the refrigeration room must be such as to ensure that the temperature referred to under paragraph 1 is reached very rapidly and maintained in all parts of the meat.\n6. The temperature should be measured with calibrated thermoelectric instruments and continuously recorded. The probe of the thermometer has to be placed at the center of a calibrated piece of meat of a size no smaller than the thickest piece of meat to  be frozen. This calibrated piece of meat should be placed at the least favorable site in the freezing room, not close to the cooling equipment or directly in the cold air flow. The instruments must be kept under lock. The charts must include the  relevant numbers from the meat inspection register on importation and the date and time of the commencement and completion of freezing, and must be retained for one year after compilation.'\nC. The following Annex V is added:\n'ANNEX V\nInspection and freezing of horse meat\n1. Inspection\nThe inspection of horse meat has to be performed according to a digestion method mentioned in Annex I with the following modifications:\n- Specimens of at least 10 g to be taken from the lingual muscle or the jaw muscle. In the absence of lingual muscle or jaw muscle a specimen of the same size to be taken from a pillar of the diaphragm at the transition to the sinewy part. The muscle  should be clean of connective tissue and fat.\n- A 5 g sample is digested for inspection if the artificial digestion of collective samples according to Annex I, Nr. III to VII is applied. For each digest, the total weight of muscle under examination must not exceed 100 g for methods III, IV, V and  VI in Annex I or 35 g for method VII in Annex I.\n- In the case of a positive result a further 10 g specimen must be taken for a subsequent independent examination.\n2. Freezing of horse meat\nTo kill trichinae by freezing, horse meat must undergo cold treatment in accordance with one of the methods described in Annex IV.'"}
