Currently, that Decision also provides for the possibility of a financial contribution from the Community for the eradication of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) and\u00a0infectious haematopoietic necrosis\u00a0(IHN), both of which diseases affect salmonides.\n(2) Disease control actions for ISA and\u00a0IHN are eligible for Community financial contribution only under Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a02792/1999 of 17\u00a0December\u00a01999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector\u00a0(4).\n(3) In the light of the adoption of Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24\u00a0October\u00a02006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and\u00a0control of certain diseases in aquatic animals\u00a0(5), it is appropriate to amend Decision\u00a090/424/EEC so that Community financial contributions can also be granted for eradication measures carried out by the Member States to\u00a0combat other diseases in aquaculture animals, subject to\u00a0Community control provisions.\n(4) Member States can receive financial contributions to support their national fisheries and aquaculture sector under Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006 of 27\u00a0July\u00a02006 on the European Fisheries Fund\u00a0(6). Article\u00a032 of that Regulation authorises Member States to allocate funds for the eradication of diseases in aquaculture under the terms of Decision\u00a090/424/EEC.\n(5) The funds for the eradication of diseases in aquaculture animals should be allocated within the operational programmes set up under Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006, the budget for which is fixed at the beginning of the programming period.\n(6) Financial contributions from the Community for disease control purposes in aquaculture animals should be subject to scrutiny regarding compliance with the control provisions laid down in Directive 2006/88/EC, in accordance with the same procedures as those that apply for such scrutiny and\u00a0control for certain terrestrial animal diseases.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to apply the procedures for financial contribution laid down in Decision 90/424/EEC also to the use of financial contribution for the control of diseases in aquaculture animals under Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006.\n(8) It is appropriate for this Decision to become applicable at the same time as Directive\u00a02006/88/EC.\n(9) Decision 90/424/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 90/424/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) in Article\u00a03(1), the following indents shall be added:\n\u2014 \u2018epizootic haematopoietic necrosis in fish (EHN),\n\u2014 epizootic ulcerative syndrome in fish (EUS),\n\u2014 infection with Bonamia exitiosa,\n\u2014 infection with Perkinsus marinus,\n\u2014 infection with Microcytos mackini,\n\u2014 Taura syndrome in crustaceans,\n\u2014 yellowhead disease in crustaceans.\u2019;\n(2) the following Article shall be inserted:\n(3) Article\u00a05(2) shall be replaced by the following:\n(4) The following paragraph shall be added to Article\u00a024:\n(a) the rate of aid shall be in accordance with the rate laid down in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01198/2006;\n(b) paragraphs\u00a08 and\u00a09 of this Article shall not apply.\n(5) the following indents shall be added to the Annex, Group I:\n\u2014 \u2018Spring viraemia of carp (SVC),\n\u2014 Viral haemorrhagic septic\u00e6mia (VHS),\n\u2014 Koi herpes virus infection (KHV),\n\u2014 Infection with Bonamia ostreae,\n\u2014 Infection with Marteilia refringens,\n\u2014 White spot disease in crustaceans.\u2019", "This Decision shall apply from 1\u00a0August\u00a02008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 24\u00a0October\u00a02006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
