Recent scientific evidence has shown that similar beneficial physiological effects may be obtained from other carbohydrate polymers that are not digestible and not naturally occurring in the food as consumed. Therefore it is appropriate that the definition of fibre should include carbohydrate polymers with one or more beneficial physiological effects.\n(6) The carbohydrate polymers of plant origin that meet the definition of fibre may be closely associated in the plant with lignin or other non-carbohydrate components such as phenolic compounds, waxes, saponins, phytates, cutin, phytosterols. These substances when closely associated with carbohydrate polymers of plant origin and extracted with the carbohydrate polymers for analysis of fibre may be considered as fibre. However, when separated from the carbohydrate polymers and added to a food these substances should not be considered as fibre.\n(7) In order to take account of new scientific and technological developments, there is a need to amend the list of energy conversion factors.\n(8) The FAO report of a technical workshop on food energy \u2014 methods of analysis and conversion factors indicates that 70 percent of the fibre in traditional foods is assumed to be fermentable. Therefore, it is appropriate that the average energy value for fibre should be 8 kJ/g (2 kcal/g).\n(9) Erythritol can be used in a wide variety of foods and its use is, among others, as a replacement for nutrients such as sugar where lower energy value is desired.\n(10) Erythritol is a polyol, and according to the current rules as provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 90/496/EEC, its energy would be calculated using the conversion factor for polyols, namely 10 kJ/g (2,4 kcal/g). Using this energy conversion factor would not fully inform the consumer about the reduced energy value of a product achieved by the use of erythritol in its manufacture. The Scientific Committee on Food in its opinion on erythritol, expressed on 5 March 2003, noted that the energy provided by erythritol was less than 0,9 kJ/g (less than 0,2 kcal/g). Therefore it is appropriate to adopt a suitable energy conversion factor for erythritol.\n(11) The Annex to Directive 90/496/EEC lists the vitamins and minerals which may be declared as part of the nutrition labelling, specifies their recommended daily allowances (RDAs) and defines a rule of what constitutes a significant amount. The purpose of this RDA list is to provide values for nutrition labelling and the calculation of what constitutes a significant amount.\n(12) The rule on significant amount as defined in the Annex to Directive 90/496/EEC constitutes a reference in other Community legislation, in particular in Article 8(3) of Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements\u00a0(3), in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in Article 6(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods\u00a0(4).\n(13) The RDAs listed in the Annex to Directive 90/496/EEC are based on the recommendation of the FAO/WHO expert consultation meeting in Helsinki in 1988.\n(14) In order to ensure coherence with other Community legislation, the current list of vitamins and minerals and their RDAs should be updated in the light of scientific developments since 1988.\n(15) The Scientific Committee on Food in its opinion on the revision of reference values for nutrition labelling, expressed on 5 March 2003, included reference labelling values for adults. This opinion covers the vitamins and minerals listed in Annex I to Directive 2002/46/EC and in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006.\n(16) The Annex to Directive 90/496/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 90/496/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
