Accordingly, consideration shall be given to factors taken into account when fixing the variable component of the minimum levies determined under the procedure referred to above in respect of oils falling within subheading 15.07 A II a) of the Common Customs Tariff and when fixing the export refunds valid for those same oils during a reference period.\nThe production refund fixed in accordance with the first subparagraph shall be corrected in Greece by the accession compensatory amount referred to in Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 5/81.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 1984.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
