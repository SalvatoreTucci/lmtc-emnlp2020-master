whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy  are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure  the availability of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices;\nWhereas the norm and intervention prices for leaf tobacco must be fixed in accordance with the  criteria laid down in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 727/70 in order, in particular, to  encourage producers to convert to the cultivation of those varieties which are most in demand and  most competitive as well as being the least harmful to health;\nWhereas it is again desirable to fix, in respect of the 1990 harvest, derived intervention prices  both for the varieties which, before the common organization of the market came into force or, in  the case of varieties grown in Greece, Spain and Portugal, prior to accession, qualified for a  price guarantee at the baled tobacco stage and for the varieties which are grown mainly in Germany,  in order to take account of the marketing practices in that country;\nWhereas Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 727/70 stipulates the fixing each year, for the  following year's harvest and within an overall quantity for the Community, and in line with the  criteria specified in that Article, of a maximum guaranteed quantity for each tobacco variety or  group of varieties grown in the Community, any overrun of which leads to a proportional reduction  in the norm and intervention prices and in the premiums; whereas these maximum guaranteed  quantities must therefore be set for the 1991 harvest;\nWhereas, when the provisions on the production quantity control arrangements are applied, account  should be taken of the differences in quality depending on the characteristics of the soil and the  climate; whereas those conditions are met for the varieties Badischer Burley and Paraguay; whereas  maximum guaranteed quantities should consequently be fixed for specific production areas for these  varieties;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 1252/89 (6) fixes in particular the maximum guaranteed quantities for  each variety or group of varieties of tobacco from the 1990 harvest; whereas, however, in view of  the major, unforeseen changes which have occurred in the supply of and demand for certain  varieties, the maximum guaranteed quantities for certain varieties should be adjusted in the  interest of the producers;\nproducers;\nWhereas the premium granted to purchasers of Community tobacco is intended to enable them to pay  producers of leaf tobacco a price which is at the level of the norm price, account being taken of  the trend in world market prices, and the level of prices established by the interaction of supply  and demand on the Community market;\nWhereas the abovementioned prices and the amount of the amount of the premium must be fixed for  each variety produced in recognized production areas and for a reference quality defined in such a  way that as objective an assessment as possible can be made of the quality of the tobacco;\nWhereas, for the 1990 harvest, the recognized production areas for each variety of tobacco should  be specified and the definitions of the reference qualities should be those laid down in Council  Regulation (EEC) No 1252/89;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1179/90 (7) provides that a\nnew representative rate for tobacco is to  apply from 14 May\n1990 to the currencies of certain Member States;\nwhereasthat provision results, as from that date, in a\nreduction in terms of national currency of  premiums fixed in\necus for a substantial part of the harvest in the Member\nStates where the  representative rate is revalued; whereas the whole harvest in a year should be treated in the same  way in view of the characteristics of the sector; whereas that aim may be achieved if the old rate  of exchange in the Member States concerned is made applicable to premiums paid for the 1989  harvest,", "main_body": ["For the 1990 harvest, the reference  qualities and recognized production areas for each of the varieties of Community-produced leaf  tobacco referred to in Article 2 (3) (b) and (c) of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 727/70, shall be as set out  respectively in Annexes I and III to this Regulation.", "For the 1990 harvest, the  reference qualities and recognized production areas referred to in Article 6 (3) (b) and (c) of  Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 727/70, for each of the varieties of Community-produced baled tobacco in  respect of which a derived intervention price is fixed, shall be as set out respectively in Annexes  II and III to this Regulation.", "1.
