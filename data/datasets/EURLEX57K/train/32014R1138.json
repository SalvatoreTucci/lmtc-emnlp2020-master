IMI CC 378536. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(2) That application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 as a feed additive for sows to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(3) A preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 was authorised for 10\u00a0years for poultry, weaned piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 290/2014\u00a0(2).\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 20 May 2014\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase EC 3.2.1.6 produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The Authority also determined that the results of the meta-analysis showed that supplementing sows' diets with the additive at the recommended dose resulted in a statistically significant lower body weight loss of the sows during lactation, without affecting the other parameters evaluated. Since the low level of weight reduction, questioned by the Authority because of lack of biological/physiological relevance, was judged a significant zootechnical parameter, it was considered that the provided in vivo studies meet the conditions for the demonstration of the efficacy in lactating sows.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase EC\u00a03.2.1.6 produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 290/2014 of 21 March 2014 concerning the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,3(4)-beta- glucanase produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov.
