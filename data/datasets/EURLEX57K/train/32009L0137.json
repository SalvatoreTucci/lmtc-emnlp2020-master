Measuring instruments must meet the essential requirements laid down in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annex.\n(2) The instrument-specific annexes of Directive 2004/22/EC contain requirements adapted to the different types of measuring instruments. These requirements include specific provisions on allowable errors in order to ensure the accuracy and performance of the measuring instrument and to guarantee that the error of measurement under rated operated conditions and in the absence of a disturbance does not exceed the defined Maximum Permissible Error (MPE) value.\n(3) Since new specifications have been developed as regards gas meters and volume conversion devices, the very specific requirement of point 2.1 of Annex MI-002 could cause obstacles to technical progress and innovation and create barriers to the free circulation of gas meters. It should therefore be replaced by a more general performance requirement.\n(4) Directive 2004/22/EC provides in point 7.3 of Annex I with regard to utility measuring instruments for a general protection against unduly biased errors outside the controlled range. However, experience has shown that in order to guarantee that a measuring instrument does not exploit the Maximum Permissible Error (MPE) and systematically favour any of the parties involved in the transaction, it is necessary to require also protection against unduly biased errors inside the controlled range of these instruments.\n(5) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making1\u00a0(2), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(6) Directive 2004/22/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Measuring Instruments Committee set up by Article 15(1) of Directive 2004/22/EC,", "main_body": ["The instrument-specific annexes MI-001 to MI-005 to Directive 2004/22/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish by 1 December 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
