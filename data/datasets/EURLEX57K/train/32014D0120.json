Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 provides that, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the coastal Member States, Union inspectors may carry out inspections in accordance with that Regulation in Union waters and on Union fishing vessels outside Union waters. The list of Union inspectors is to be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(2) lays down detailed rules for the application of the control system of the European Union as established by Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 provides that the list of Union inspectors is to be adopted on the basis of the notifications of Member States and of the European Fisheries Control Agency.\n(4) A first list of Union inspectors was adopted in Commission Implementing Decision 2011/883/EU\u00a0(3). That list was replaced by a new list of Union inspectors adopted in Commission Implementing Decision 2013/174/EU\u00a0(4). Article 120 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 provides that after the establishment of the initial list, Member States and the European Fisheries Control Agency shall notify by October each year any amendment to the list they wish to introduce for the following calendar year, and that the Commission shall amend the list accordingly by 31 December.\n(5) Some Member States have notified whole lists of their relevant inspectors. It is therefore appropriate to replace the list established in Implementing Decision 2013/174/EU and to lay down in the Annex to this Decision a new list of Union inspectors on the basis of these notifications and notifications on amendments to the initial list received from Member States.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["The list of Union inspectors is set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "Implementing Decision 2013/174/EU is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nMaria DAMANAKI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 112, 30.4.2011, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 23.12.2011, p. 123.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 101, 10.4.2013, p. 31.\nANNEX\nLIST OF UNION INSPECTORS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 79(1) OF REGULATION (EC) No 1224/2009\nCountry Inspectors\nBelgium De Vleeschouwer, Guy\nBulgaria Kamenov, Vladimir Angelov\nCzech Republic n/a\nDenmark Akselsen, Ole\nGermany Abs, Volker\nEstonia Grossmann, Meit\nIreland Allan, Damien\nGreece \u0391\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\nSpain Acu\u00f1a Barros, Jos\u00e9 Antonio\nFrance Baillet, Bertrand\nCroatia A\u0107imov, Dejan\nItaly Abate, Massimiliano\nCyprus Apostolou, Antri\nLatvia Barsukovs, Vladislavs\nLithuania Balnis, Algirdas\nLuxembourg n/a\nHungary n/a\nMalta Abela, Claire\nNetherlands Bakker, Jan\nAustria n/a\nPoland Anulewicz, Adam\nPortugal Albuquerque, Jos\u00e9\nRomania B\u00e2rsan, Marilena\nSlovenia Smoje, Robert\nSlovakia n/a\nFinland Heikkinen, Pertti\nSweden \u00c5berg, Christian\nUnited Kingdom Adamson, Gary\nEuropean Commission Alcaide, Mario\nEuropean Fisheries Control Agency Allen, Patrick"}
