The group should, in particular, help the Commission select those parts of the Draft Common Frame of Reference which are of direct or indirect relevance for contract law, and restructure, revise and supplement the selected contents.\n(9) The group should be composed of highly qualified experts with competence in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, appointed in a personal capacity.\n(10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom\u00a0(4).\n(11) Personal data relating to members of the group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(5).\n(12) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision.
