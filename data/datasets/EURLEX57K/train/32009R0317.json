In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.\n(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2008 (1 October 2007 \u2013 30 September 2008). On the basis of the data published by the United States Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD\u00a016,31 million.\n(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has decreased, the products of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 which were added in 2006 and 2007 to the list in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be removed first from the list in Annex I to that Regulation. Four products of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should then be withdrawn from Annex I to that Regulation following the order of that list.\n(4) The effect of a 15\u00a0% ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD\u00a016,31 million.\n(5) To make sure that there are no delays in the customs clearance of goods removed from the scope of the 15\u00a0% ad valorem additional import duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on trade retaliation,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by the text of the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nCatherine ASHTON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 110, 30.4.2005, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nThe products on which additional duties are to apply are identified by their eight-digit CN codes.
