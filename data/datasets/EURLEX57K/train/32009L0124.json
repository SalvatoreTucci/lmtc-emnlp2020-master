By-products of the fish filleting industry are valuable raw materials for the production of fish meal and fish oil for use in compound feed, in particular fish feed.\n(3) The increase of the maximum levels for total arsenic in feedingstuffs obtained from the processing of fish or other marine animals and feedingstuffs for fish entails no change in the maximum levels for inorganic arsenic. Since the potential adverse effects of arsenic to animal and human health are determined by the inorganic fraction in a given feed or food product and the organic arsenic compounds exhibit a very low toxic potential\u00a0(2), the increased levels for total arsenic do not affect the protection of animal and public health.\n(4) In Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, arsenic refers to total arsenic for the purpose of setting maximum levels, since there is no standardised routine method for the analysis of inorganic arsenic. But for cases in which the competent authorities request an analysis of the content of inorganic arsenic, that Annex sets out a maximum level for inorganic arsenic.\n(5) As the extraction method has in some cases a significant influence on the analytical result on total arsenic, it is appropriate to specify an extraction procedure for reference to be used for official control.\n(6) Information provided by competent authorities and stakeholder organisations indicate significant levels of arsenic in additives belonging to the functional group of compounds of trace elements, authorised in application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3). It is appropriate to establish maximum levels for arsenic in these additives to protect animal and public health.\n(7) As regards theobromine, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded in its opinion of 10 June 2008\u00a0(4) that the current maximum levels for theobromine may not fully protect some animal species. It pointed out possible adverse effects on pigs, dogs and horses and on milk production in dairy cows. It is therefore appropriate to establish lower maximum levels.\n(8) As regards alkaloids in Datura sp., EFSA concluded in its opinion of 9 April 2008\u00a0(5) that, since tropane alkaloids are present in all Datura sp., it is appropriate for the protection of animal health, in particular for pigs, to extend the maximum levels for Datura stramonium L., as set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, to all Datura\u00a0sp.\n(9) As regards ricin (from Ricinus communis L.), EFSA concluded in its opinion of 10\u00a0June 2008\u00a0(6) that, given the similar toxic effects of the toxins from Ricinus communis L. (ricin), Croton tiglium L. (crotin) and Abrus precatorius L. (abrin), it is appropriate to apply the maximum levels for Ricinus communis L., as set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, also to Croton tiglium L. and Abrus precatorius L., separately or in combination.\n(10) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 July 2010 at the latest.
