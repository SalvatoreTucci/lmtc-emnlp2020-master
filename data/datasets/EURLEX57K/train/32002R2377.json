For barley, the Community has decided to replace the \"margin of preference\" system by two tariff quotas: one tariff quota of 50000 tonnes for malting barley and one tariff quota of 300000 for barley. This Regulation concerns the tariff quota of 50000 tones of malting barley.\n(2) Under the Community's international commitments, malting barley for import must be intended for use in the manufacture of beer aged in vats containing beechwood. In this respect, provisions should be adopted relating to the quality criteria for barley and to processing requirements similar to those of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2001 of 22 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 822/1999 and providing for the partial reimbursement of import duties levied on a quota of barley for malting(5).\n(3) The opening of this quota means that Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 has to be adapted. In order to enable the quota to be opened on 1 January 2003, provision should be made to derogate from Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, during a transitional period expiring on the date of entry into force of the amendment to that Regulation, but until 30 June 2003 at the latest.\n(4) To ensure that imports of the barley covered by this tariff quota are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject where appropriate to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(5) To ensure the proper management of this quota, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in applications and licences should be specified.\n(6) To take account of supply conditions, a derogation should be made concerning the period of validity of the licences.\n(7) Taking account of the obligation to apply a high level of guarantee to insure adequate execution of the quota and that this guarantee vwould have to be in place during all the processing period, it is adequate to exempt importers whose consignements of malting barley are accompanied by a certificate of conformity agreed with the government of the United States of America according to the administrative cooperation procedure provided for in Articles 63 to 65 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(6), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(7).\n(8) With a view to the sound management of the quota, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(9), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.\n(9) To ensure sound management of this quota, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(11).\n(10) Rapid two-way communication should be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 10(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, the import duty for malting barley falling in CN code 1003 00 shall be fixed in the framework of the quota opened by this Regulation.", "0(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 shall apply to imports of the products referred to in this Regulation in excess of the quantity provided for in Article 2.", "1.

Where the quality criteria and/or the conditions relating to processing set out in Articles 5 and 6 of this Regulation are not fulfilled, the security for import licences referred to in Article 10(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 and the additional security referred to in Article 6(2)(b) of this Regulation shall be forfeit unless the importer is able to produce a new import licence drawn on the quota administered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2376/2002(12).
