PROCEDURE  (1) On 7 April 1990 the Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) a notice of the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint  lighters, falling within CN code 9613 10 00 originating in Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.\n(2) The Commission conducted an examination of dumping and injury. All companies were informed of the essential facts of the results of the investigation and had an opportunity to comment on them. It was established that dumping was taking place, that  injury was caused to the Community industry concerned by the dumped imports and that the Community's interests called for the imposition of definitive measures. Consequently, the Council imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 (3), a definitive  anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand. For one Thai producer, Thai Merry Co. Ltd, a dumping margin of 14,1 % was  established, and, as the injury threshold for this company exceeded its dumping margin, duties could have been imposed at the level of the dumping margin. However, a price undertaking from this company was accepted by Commission Decision 91/604/EEC (4).  The Council accordingly exempted imports of the product concerned produced by Thai Merry Co. Ltd from the definitive anti-dumping duty.\nB. WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNDERTAKING  (3) Thai Merry Co. Ltd has, by correspondance dated 18 August 1993, withdrawn its undertaking. Accordingly, the exemption from the said anti-dumping duty of the imports of the product concerned produced by Thai Merry  Co. Ltd is no longer justified.\nThe exporter has, according to Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, been informed of the Commission's intention to apply provisional anti-dumping duties on the basis of the facts established before the acceptance of the undertaking and has  been offered the opportunity to comment. No comments relevant to the imposition of provisional duties were received within the time period allowed.\nC. COMMUNITY INTEREST  (4) The Commission has no reason to believe that the findings concerning Community interest expressed in Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 warrant amendment. In addition, not imposing provisional duties on Thai Merry Co. Ltd would be  discriminatory towards those exporters on which measures are still in force. Since no arguments that such measures would not be in the Community interest have been put forward, it is considered that the Community's interests call for the immediate  application of provisional measures.\nD. PROVISIONAL DUTIES  (5) According to Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, provisional anti-dumping duties should be applied on the basis of the facts established before the acceptance of the undertaking. The level of the provisional  anti-dumping duty should therefore be set at a rate of 14,1 %,", "main_body": ["1.
