The second subparagraph of Article 2 (2) is replaced by the following:\n'However, where the nature of the group is such that ownership of individual animals cannot be assigned to each producer, the articles of association or the rules of procedure of the group must necessarily give a formula for apportioning the sheep  and/or goat flock between the various producers concerned within the meaning of point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3493/90.\nThat formula must correspond to the way the group's assets would be apportioned between the producer between the producer members were the group to be disbanded and shall be notified to the competent authority. This formula shall remain unaltered in  subsequent marketing years unless the structure of the group which has been notified to the authority comptent for granting the premium undergoes a substantial change; such a change shall be the result of:\n- new members joining or old members leaving, or\n- a change of 10 % or more in the apportionment of the members' assets as a whole.\nAnnual premium applications must specify the number of ewes attributed to each producer on the basis of the said formula.'\n2. Article 2 (3) (a) is replaced by the following:\n'(a) producer members having an employer-employee relationship with another producer member or with the group;'.\n3. The following paragraph 4 is added to Article 2:\n'4. Producer groups may not include those set up after the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 following the splitting-up of the flock of an existing holding, where applicable by applying the formula for apportionment referred to in Article  2 (2) where these have been created primarily to circumvent the individual limits laid down in Article 5 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.\nCases where the partners concerned can demonstrate a substantial change in the physical or financial structure of the holding which would on its own justify the creation of a producer group shall not be considered to fall within the preceding  subparagraph.'\n4. The following subparagrahs are added to Article 3 (3):\n'Member States shall inform the Commission of the steps taken with regard to the designation or approval of the local authority competent to issue the attestations referred to in the first subparagraph.\nThe attestations must state:\n- the place of transhumance,\n- the dates of the transhumant animals' 'arrival and departure.'\n5. Points IV and V of the Annex are replaced by points IV and V of the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nPoints 1 and 5 of Article 1 shall apply to applications submitted in respect of the 1991 marketing year. Point 3 of Article 1 shall apply to premium applications submitted in respect of the 1992 and subsequent marketing years.
