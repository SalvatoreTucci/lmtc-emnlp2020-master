Text with EEA relevance\n", "header": "24.2.2011 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 49/6\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 169/2011\nof 23 February 2011\nconcerning the authorisation of diclazuril as a feed additive for guinea fowls (holder of authorisation Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.\n(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 an application was submitted for the authorisation of diclazuril. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of diclazuril as a feed additive for guinea fowls, to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019.\n(4) The use of diclazuril was authorised for 10 years in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2) as a feed additive for use in chickens reared for laying up to 16 weeks and turkeys up to 12 weeks by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3). The use for chickens for fattening was authorised for 10 years by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1118/2010\u00a0(4).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of diclazuril for guinea fowls. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 5 October 2010\u00a0(5) that, under the proposed conditions of use, diclazuril does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use controls coccidiosis in guinea fowls. It considers that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring to control the possible development of bacterial and/or Eimeria spp resistances. The Authority also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of diclazuril shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 3.12.2010, p. 5.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(10):1866.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition\nCharacterisation of the active substance\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1)\nFor determination of diclazuril in feed: reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Ultraviolet detection at 280 nm (Regulation (EC) No 152/2009)\nFor determination of diclazuril in poultry tissues: HPLC coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) using one precursor ion and two product ions\n1.
