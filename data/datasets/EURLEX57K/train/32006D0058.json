However, at the same time the SCF confirmed that the addition of phytosterols to a wide range of bakery products was safe.\n(8) In order to meet the concerns on cumulative intakes of phytosterols/phytostanols from different products Pharmaconsult Oy consequently agreed to reduce the original application on bakery products exclusively to rye bread.\n(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 608/2004 of 31 March 2004 concerning the labelling of foods and food ingredients with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols and/or phytostanol esters\u00a0(2), ensures that consumers receive the information necessary in order to avoid excessive intake of additional phytosterols.\n(10) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not given a favourable opinion; the Commission therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 22 August 2005 in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC\u00a0(3), the Council being required to act within three months.\n(11) However, the Council has not acted within the required time-limit; a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Foods and food ingredients as described in Annex I with added phytosterols/phytostanols as specified in Annex II, hereinafter called the products, may be placed on the market in the Community.", "The products shall be presented in such a manner that they can be easily divided into portions that contain either maximum 3\u00a0g (in case of one portion per day) or maximum 1\u00a0g (in case of three portions per day) of added phytosterols/phytostanols.", "This Decision is addressed to Pharmaconsult Oy, Riippakoivunkuja 5, FIN-02130 Espoo."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.
