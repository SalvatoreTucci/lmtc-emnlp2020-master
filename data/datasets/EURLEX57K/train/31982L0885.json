GENERAL\n1.1. In the case of a heat generator capable of using various types of fuel (liquid or gaseous), the test shall be carried out with a fuel of each type which is in conformity with the manufacturer's specifications and available at the time of the test.\n1.2. The exit for the flue-gases shall be provided with an aperture for the insertion of measuring probes and for smoke sampling.\n1.3. The accuracy of each measurement must be such as to enable the overall accuracy of results specified by the Member States to be obtained.\n1.4. The test will be carried out within a reasonable period of time and preferably at the nominal calorific output of the generator. Where this is impossible, the next-closest load should be used. If the generator is designed to operate at two or at several loads, a reduced load test may also be carried out at the request of the Member States. The loads used shall be assessed by a reliable method.\n1.5. Performance, whether determined by the direct or indirect method, shall be expressed as a percentage on the basis of the net or gross calorific value of the fuel injected into the burner at the load assessed as indicated in 1.4.\n2. TEST CONDITIONS\n2.1. Preparation of the generator\n2.1.1. It shall be the responsibility of the user, with the possible help of the manufacturer and/or the installer, to carry out before the test any cleaning, regulation and preparation of the generator which he considers necessary. The competent administrative authorities may make such cleaning compulsory.\n2.1.2. The leak tightness of the generator and of its connection with the flue shall be checked.\n2.2. Identification of the generator\n2.2.1. Prior to the test, the inspecting body (hereinafter called \"the body\") shall record all necessary data for identification of the generator, and at least the generator's features or specifications as stated for example on the data plate and/or in the instructions for assembly and operation given to the user with regard to manufacturer, make, year of manufacture and heat rating.\n2.2.2. The body shall check that the necessary conditions are fulfilled for ensuring that no disturbance occurs during the test which is likely to adversely affect its validity. To this end it shall in particular require the user to produce the certificates \u2014 or provide any other means of proof \u2014 establishing that the safety checks laid down for the boiler-room and boiler-room premises have been carried out. This condition may be deemed to have been fulfilled in Member States where heat generators cannot be installed or put into operation without prior safety checks. If no such checks are required by national law, the body is entitled to reasonable assurance of safe working conditions before it carries out the check.\nShould it fail to obtain satisfaction on the above points, the body may refuse to carry out the check; in that event it shall draw up an ad hoc report.\n2.3. Preliminary running\n2.3.1. Prior to the test, preliminary running may be carried out by the body in order to check and pre-set the functioning of the measuring equipment installed for checking purposes. The body shall ensure that all measurements are to the required degree of accuracy. More specifically, if the body decides to use certain measuring instruments forming part of the installation's normal equipment, it must check that these meet the desired conditions as regards standards of accuracy and reliability.\n2.3.2. It shall be the responsibility of the user, assisted by the manufacturer and/or the installer, with the permission of the generator's owner, to carry out any final adjustments to the generator which may be necessary and to provide any additional explanations of the various instructions so as to create optimum test conditions.\n2.4. The test\n2.4.1. Testing operations shall be the responsibility of the body alone.\n2.4.2. The test shall be carried out under steady-state conditions, with the fuel and combustion-air flow rates kept constant.\n2.4.3. During the test the body shall take the compulsory measurements provided for under 3 and, if appropriate, the optional measurements provided for under 4. It shall draw up a report as provided in 5.\n3. DETERMINATION OF LOSSES VIA FLUE GASES\n3.1. Measurement of sensible-heat losses\nWhere performance is determined by the indirect method, the body shall be entitled to measure the percentage by volume by either carbon dioxide or oxygen in the flue gases.\nIt shall then apply a formula which in addition to the temperature difference between flue gases and combustion air incorporates adequate constants. The formula and constants must have been published by the Member State under whose jurisdiction the inspecting body comes or be laid down in a standard.\nIn the absence of official regulations or a standard, sensible-heat losses may be calculated from the characteristics of the fuel, its calorific value and the volume of excess air by using tables giving the specific heat of combustion gases such as those established by the 12th World Gas Congress (IGU/E/17/73).\nThe above procedure shall not apply to condensing boilers.\n3.2. Measurement of flue-gas capacity\nThe body shall carry out this measurement where the generator uses a liquid fuel or a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) injected in liquid form; measurement shall be by means of an adequate instrument; the result shall be expressed as a conventional smoke number (0 to 9).\n4. OTHER CHECKS (OPTIONAL)\n4.1. Traces of carbon monoxide\nThe body may be empowered to check that generator flue-gases do not contain carbon monoxide in such quantities as to cast doubts on the results of measurements made in accordance with 3.1.\n4.2. Losses through the heat generator casing\nIn those Member States where there are neither regulations nor technical rules or other provisions on the subject, the body may be authorized to assess casing losses from data provided by the manufacturer and/or from surface temperatures observed during the test.\n5. TEST REPORT\nAfter the test the body shall draw up a report in the form laid down by the Member State, giving the generator's main features, the measurements taken, the formula used to calculate losses and the heat generator's performance.\n--------------------------------------------------"}
