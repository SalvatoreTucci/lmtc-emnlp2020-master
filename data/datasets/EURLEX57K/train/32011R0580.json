In line with the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation strategy, and as a contribution to this debate, the Commission launched a public consultation on the objectives for a strengthened network and information security policy at Union level, which ran from November 2008 to January 2009. In December 2009 the debate resulted in a Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to Network and Information Security\u00a0(5).\n(4) Taking account of the results of the public debate, it is envisaged to replace Regulation (EC) No 460/2004.\n(5) A legislative procedure to reform the Agency may require extensive time for debate, and since the mandate of the Agency will expire on 13 March 2012, it is necessary to adopt an extension which will both enable sufficient discussion in the European Parliament and in the Council and ensure consistency and continuity.\n(6) The duration of the Agency should therefore be extended until 13 September 2013,", "main_body": ["Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 27\nDuration\nThe Agency shall be established from 14 March 2004 for a period of 9 years and 6 months.\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 8 June 2011.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
