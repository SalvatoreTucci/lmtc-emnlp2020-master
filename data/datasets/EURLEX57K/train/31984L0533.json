BARRY  (1) This Directive was notified to the Member States on 26 September 1984.\nANNEX I  METHOD OF MEASURING AIRBORNE NOISE EMITTED BY COMPRESSORS\nSCOPE\nThis measurement method is applicable to compressors. It specifies the test procedures for use in determining the sound power level of such equipment for the purpose of EEC type-examination and testing as to conformity.\nThese technical procedures shall comply with the requirements of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC.\nAll the sections in Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC shall apply to compressors, subject to the following amendments:\n4. CRITERIA TO BE USED FOR EXPRESSING RESULTS\n4.1. The acoustic criterion for the environment of compressors is their sound power level.\n6. MEASURING CONDITIONS\n6.1. During testing, no tools shall be coupled to the compressor. At each measuring point, the noise level of release and escape of air from the external lines coupled to the air outlet valves of compressors shall be more than 10 dB lower than the noise level of the compressor.\n6.2. Operation of the sound source during measurement.\n6.2.1. Not applicable.\n6.2.2. The compressor shall be brought to its steady-state temperature within the range specified by the manufacturer. It shall operate at its nominal speed and its nominal pressure.\nThe nominal speed and pressure are those appearing in the direction for use supplied to the purchaser.\nIn these operating conditions, the air flow shall be checked as laid down in International Standard ISO 1217, first edition, 1975.\n6.3. Measuring site.\nThe compressor shall be installed on a reflecting plane of concrete or non-porous asphalt. Skid-mounted compressors shall be placed on supports 0,40 m high, unless otherwise required by the manufacturer's conditions of installation.\n6.4.1. Measuring surface.\nThe measuring surface to be used for testing shall be a hemisphere. The centre of the hemisphere shall be the vertical projection onto the reflecting plane of the geometric centre of the compressor. The radius shall be:      - 4 m, where the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is not more than 1,5 m,\n- 10 m, where the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is more than 1,5 m but not more than 4 m,\n- 16 m, where the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is more than 4 m.\nTable I in Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC gives the coordinates of the measuring points.\n6.4.2.1. The x axis of the set of coordinates, in relation to which the positions of the measuring points are fixed, shall be parallel to the main axis of the compressor.\n7. MEASUREMENTS\n7.1.1. Only the background noise shall be taken into account for the purpose of corrections.\n7.1.5. Presence of obstacles\nA visual check in a circular zone with a radius of three times that of the measurement hemisphere and the centre of which coincides with the centre of that hemisphere is adequate to ensure that the provisions of the third subparagraph of section 6.3 of Annex I to Directive 79/113/EEC are complied with.\n7.2. If the sound pressure levels at the measuring points are determined from readings taken by a sonometer, there shall be at least five such readings, taken at regular intervals.\n8. USE OF RESULTS\n8.2. Not applicable.\n8.6.2. In view of 6.3, section 8.6.2 is not applicable and C = 0.\nANNEX II  MODEL INFORMATION DOCUMENT FOR A TYPE OF COMPRESSOR TO BE SUPPLIED FOR  EEC TYPE-EXAMINATION\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026407\">\nANNEX III  MODEL FOR MARK FOR SOUND POWER LEVEL\n>PIC FILE= \"T0026408\">\nANNEX IV  TECHNICAL PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING THE CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION MODELS  WITH THE TYPE EXAMINED\nThe conformity of production models with the type examined shall, if possible, be verified by spot checks."}
