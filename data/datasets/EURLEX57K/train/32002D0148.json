Piqu\u00e9 i Camps\n(1) OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3.\nANNEX\nBrussels, ...\nLETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE\nThe European Union attaches the utmost importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nThus, the European Union on 29 October 2001 expressed its deep concern at the situation in Zimbabwe and decided to invite the authorities of Zimbabwe to hold consultations, with a view to assessing the situation in detail and remedying it.\nDuring these consultations, which took place in Brussels on 11 January 2002, the European Union reiterated its serious concern as regards politically motivated violence, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, end of illegal farm occupations and free and fair elections, and considered that significant progress remains to be achieved in these areas.\nThe European Union was confident that free and fair presidential elections in March 2002 would put the country on the path of democracy, social peace and economic recovery in Zimbabwe. However, it notes that these expectations have not been fulfilled. Minimum internationally agreed conditions for free and fair elections are not being met.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union has decided to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. The Union has decided to take the following appropriate measures, within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement:\n(a) The financing of budgetary support under Zimbabwe's 7th and 8th EDF National Indicative Programmes (NIP) is suspended.\n(b) Financial support for all projects is suspended except those in direct support of the population, in particular in the social sectors.\n(c) Financing shall be reoriented in direct support of the population, in particular in the social sectors, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law.\n(d) The signature of the 9th EDF NIP is suspended.\n(e) Article 12 of Annex 2 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is suspended in so far as required for the application of restrictive measures adopted on the basis of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(f) Contributions to operations of a humanitarian nature will not be affected.\n(g) Regional projects will be evaluated on a case by case basis.\nThese measures will be revoked once conditions prevail which ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.\nThe European Union reserves the right to take additional restrictive measures.\nThe European Union will closely follow developments in Zimbabwe and would once again like to emphasise its desire to pursue the dialogue with Zimbabwe, on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
