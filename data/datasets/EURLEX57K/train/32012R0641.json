Place of birth: Eilbur, Somalia. Nationality: Somalia. Alt. nationality: Djibouti. Passport: A0181988 (Somalia), exp. 23 January 2011. Location: Djibouti, Republic of Djibouti. Date of UN Designation: 17 February 2012.\nAli Ahmed Nur Jim\u2019ale (Jim\u2019ale) has served in leadership roles with the former Somali Council of Islamic Courts, also known as the Somali Islamic Courts Union, which was a radical-Islamist element. The most radical elements of the Somali Islamic Courts Union eventually formed the group known as Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab was listed for targeted sanctions in April 2010 by the United Nations Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolutions 751 (1992) and 1907 (2009) concerning Somalia and Eritrea (the \u2018Somalia/Eritrea Sanctions Committee\u2019). The Committee listed Al-Shabaab for being an entity engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, including but not limited to acts that pose a threat to Somali Transitional Federal Government.\nAccording to the 18 July 2011 report of the Somalia/Eritrea Sanctions Committee\u2019s Monitoring Group (S/2011/433), Jim\u2019ale is identified as a prominent businessman and figure in the Al-Shabaab charcoal-sugar trading cycle and benefitting from privileged relationships with Al-Shabaab.\nJim\u2019ale is identified as one of Al-Shabaab\u2019s chief financiers and is ideologically aligned with Al-Shabaab. Jim\u2019ale has provided key funding and political support for Hassan Dahir Aweys (\u2018Aweys\u2019), who was also listed by the Somalia/Eritrea Sanctions Committee. Former Al-Shabaab Deputy Emir Muktar Robow reportedly continued to engage in political posturing within the Al-Shabaab organization during the mid-2011. Robow engaged Aweys and Jim\u2019ale in an effort to advance their shared objectives and consolidate their overall stance within the context of the Al-Shabaab leadership rift.\nAs of fall 2007, Jim\u2019ale established a front company in Djibouti for extremist activities called the Investors Group. The short-term goal of the group was, through the funding of extremist activities and weapons purchases, to destabilize Somaliland. The group assisted in smuggling small arms from Eritrea through Djibouti into the 5th region of Ethiopia where extremists received the shipment. As of mid-2008, Jim\u2019ale continued to operate the Investors Group.\nAs of late September 2010, Jim\u2019ale established ZAAD, a mobile-to-mobile money-transfer business and struck a deal with Al-Shabaab to make money transfers more anonymous by eliminating the need to show identification.\nAs of late 2009, Jim\u2019ale had a known hawala fund where he collected zakat, which was provided to Al-Shabaab."}
