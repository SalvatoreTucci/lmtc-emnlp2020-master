Despite the increasing imports in January 2012 the pace of imports from African, Caribbean and Pacific States and Least Developed Countries decreased considerably since mid-February 2012. This analysis was confirmed by a large majority of Member States in the Management Committee of 8 March 2012 who considered that there were still supply problems that would get worse in the course of the marketing year. This could concern especially small and medium Enterprises and customers with fixed quantities in long term contracts.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to advance the periods of submission of tenders and their ending dates which Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1239/2011 scheduled for 6 June 2012, 27 June 2012 and 11 July 2012.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No\u00a01239/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to give a rapid signal to the market and to ensure efficient management of the measure, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1239/2011, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\"2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period.
