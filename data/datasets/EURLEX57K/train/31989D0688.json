The revenue from this tax shall be put to use by the competent authorities of each  French overseas department in such a way as to encourage as effectively as possible its economic  and social development. The Commission shall be informed at the earliest opportunity of the  measures adopted by the competent authorities in order to achieve this objective.\n2.  The competent authorities of each French overseas department shall establish a basic rate of  tax. This rate may be adjusted according to the categories of products. This adjustment shall in no  case be such as to maintain or introduce discrimination against products from the Community.\n3.  In the light of the specific constraints on the French overseas departments and with a view to  achieving the objective referred to in Article 227 (2) of the Treaty, partial or total exemptions  from the charge according to economic requirements, may be authorized for local production  activities for a period of not more than 10 years from the date of introduction of the system of  changes under the conditions laid down in Article 3. These exemptions must contribute to the  promotion or maintenance of an economic activity in the French overseas departments and be in line  with the economic and social development strategy of each French overseas department, taking  account of its Community aid framework, while not being such as to adversely affect the terms of  trade to an extent contrary to the common interest.\nExemption arrangements adopted by the competent authorities in each French overseas department  shall be notified to the Commission, which shall inform the Member States thereof and define its  position within two months on the basis of the above criteria. If the Commission has not defined  its position within that period, the arrangement shall be deemed to be approved.\nThe Commission shall submit to the Council a report on the implementation of the exemption  arrangements no later than five years after the introduction of the system of charges in question.", "Not later than one year before the end of the period provided for in Article 2 (3), the  Commission shall submit to the\nCouncil a report on the implementation of the arrangements referred  to in Article 2, in order to ascertain the impact of the measures adopted on the economies of the  French overseas departments and their contribution to the promotion or maintenance of local  economic activities. The matters to be covered in the report shall include the effect of the system  of charges in question on the economic and social adjustment of the French overseas departments  taking as criteria the level of unemployment, the balance of trade, the regional gross domestic  product both on the free movement of products within the Community and on regional cooperation  between the French overseas departments and their neighbours.\nIn the light of the report's conclusions, the Commission, taking into account the objective  regarding the economic and social development of the French overseas departments set out in Article  227 (2) of the Treaty shall, if necessary, at the same time submit to the Council a proposal for  maintaining the possibility of exemptions.\nSupport measures with the same objectives may be taken in the context of regional aid.", "Pending implementation of the reform of the dock dues arrangements in accordance with  the principles set out in Article 1, the French Republic shall be authorized to maintain the  current dock dues arrangements, until not later than 31 December 1992, on condition that any  proposal concerning extension of the list of products subject to dock dues or any increase in the  rates thereof is notified to the Commission, which may oppose it within two months.
