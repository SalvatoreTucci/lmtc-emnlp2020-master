whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed the traditional annual level of  imports and the absorption capacity of the Community market; whereas, therefore, the beef and veal  market would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering, in particular, market prices and  producers' incomes and making public intervention more difficult;\nWhereas, however, it is necessary to take into account the application of the Agreement on  Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; whereas the  management meausures provided for should therefore be restricted to products from the thrid  countries to which the Community grants preferential treatment and which have accepted that the  Community take measures to manage the importation of the animals in question;\nWhereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1996 is estimated at 425  000 head  other than pure bred breedings animals; whereas, in view of imports planned under certain  preferential arrangements for 1996, i.e. 300  500 head under the quota established by the context  of the Uruguay Round concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for  fattening and under the Europe Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland, the Republic of  Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria and the  agreements on free trade and trade-related measures with the Baltic Republics, 124  500 head should  be admitted for import at the full rate of import duty in 1996;\nWhereas it is planned to extend the autonomous measures applied in 1995; whereas, pending the entry  into force of the extension of these autonomous measures, management measures should be taken and  only 50  % of the 124  500 head should be opened for the first half of 1996 with, as countries of  origin, the aforementioned countries;\nWhereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be  able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria;\nWhereas, in order to take account to the greatest extent of the traditional structure of the  Community veal market, imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications;  whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities  available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas,  so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be  made available for opertaors able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving  trade in a significant number of animals; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure  efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported or imported  during 1995 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a  normal load and whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a  minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of  those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same  Member State;\nWhereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the  first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for  those importers, therefore, imports carried out between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1995 from  countries considered third countries depending on the year of importation should be taken into  account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities reserved for traditional  importers;\nWhereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer  carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1996;\nWhereas the quota in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules  should be set on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and  licences, by way of derogation, if necessary, from certain provisions of Commission Regulation  (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the  system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products   (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95  (2), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No  1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal  sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80  (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2856/95   (4), whereas it should moreover be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection  period and where necessary with a flat-rate percentage reduction applied;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Imports into the Community, at the full rate provided for in the  Common Customs Tariff of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102  90  05, 0102  90  21,  0102  90  29, 0102  90  41 and 0102  90  49, as referred to in Article 1  (1)  (a) of Council  Regulation (EEC) No 805/68  (5), originating in the third countries listed in Annex I, shall be  subject to the management measures laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
