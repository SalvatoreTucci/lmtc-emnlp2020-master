In accordance with that Annex, the MRLs for muscle did not apply to the injection site for which higher levels are provided for.\n(4) Additional data were provided and assessed leading the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use to recommend the establishment of final MRLs for tildipirosin for bovine, caprine and porcine species, applicable to muscle, fat (skin and fat in natural proportions for porcine species), liver and kidney, excluding animals from which milk is produced for human consumption. Taking into account that the Commission and residue control authorities consider that, in order to ensure the feasibility of residue controls, a single MRL for muscle must be established, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use, in a revised opinion, did not recommend to provide for a separate MRL for injection site muscle as this was the case in its previous opinions.\n(5) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species.\n(6) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the extrapolation of the MRLs for tildipirosin in bovine species to caprine species. It also concluded that the extrapolation to other food producing species cannot be supported for this substance.\n(7) The entry for tildipirosin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include final MRLs for the pharmaceutical substance tildipirosin for bovine, caprine and porcine species, applicable to muscle, fat (skin and fat in natural proportions for porcine species), liver and kidney. The provisions on the MRLs for the injection site as regards muscle and on provisional MRLs should be removed.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRLs.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 3 May 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 759/2010 of 24 August 2010 amending the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin, as regards the substance tildipirosin (OJ L 223, 25.8.2010, p. 39).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance tildipirosin is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Tildipirosin Tildipirosin Bovine, caprine 400\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption.
