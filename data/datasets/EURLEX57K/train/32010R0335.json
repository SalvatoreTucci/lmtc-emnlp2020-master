That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019.\n(4) From the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) adopted on 11\u00a0November 2009\u00a0(2), read in combination with those of 16\u00a0April 2008\u00a0(3) and 2 April 2009\u00a0(4) it results that zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. According to the opinion of 16\u00a0April 2008, the use of that preparation may be considered as a source of available zinc and fulfils the criteria of a nutritional additive for all animal species. The Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 888/2009 of 25 September 2009 concerning the authorisation of Zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine as a feed additive for chickens for fattening\u00a0(5) that preparation was already authorised as a feed additive for chickens for fattening. That Regulation should be repealed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018compounds of trace elements\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Regulation (EC) No 888/2009 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 7(11): 1381.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 694, 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1042:1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 254, 26.9.2009, p. 71.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nContent of element (Zn) in mg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of nutritional additives.
