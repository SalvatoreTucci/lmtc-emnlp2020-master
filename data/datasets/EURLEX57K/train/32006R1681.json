The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) In view of the information provided by Ireland on the period 1 January to 31 December 2005, the average ageing period for Irish whiskey in 2005 was five years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007 should therefore be set accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area precludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Community has concluded with certain third countries agreements abolishing export refunds. According to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93, this should be taken into account in the calculation of the coefficients for the period 2006/2007,", "main_body": ["For the period 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007, the coefficients provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 applying to cereals used in Ireland for manufacturing Irish whiskey shall be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 November 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.
