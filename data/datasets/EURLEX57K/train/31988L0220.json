Member States may raise the limit laid down in paragraph 1 to a maximum of 25 % in the case of certain bonds when these are issued by a credit institution which has its registered office in a Member State and is subject by law to special public supervision designed to protect bond-holders. In particular, sums deriving from the issue of these bonds\nmust be invested in conformity with the law in assets which, during the whole period of validity of the bonds, are capable of covering claims attaching to the bonds and which, in the event of failure of the issuer, would be used on a priority basis for the reimbursement of the principal and payment of the accrued interest.\nWhen a UCITS invests more than 5 % of its assets in the bonds referred to in the first subparagraph and issued by one issuer, the total value of these investments may not exceed 80 % of the value of the asserts of the UCITS.\nAs laid down in Article 20 (1), Member States shall send the Commission a list of the aforementioned categories of bonds together with the categories of issuers authorized, in accordance with the laws and supervisory arrangements mentioned in the first subparagraph, to issue bonds complying with the criteria set out above. A notice specifying the status of the guarantees offered shall be attached to these lists. The procedure laid down in Article 20 (2) shall apply.\n5. The transferable securities referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not be taken into account for the purpose of applying the limit of 40 % referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe limits provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 may not be combined, and thus investments in transferable securities issued by the same body carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall under no circumstances exceed in total 35 % of the assets of an UCITS.'", "The Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive by the same dates as those provided for in Directive 85/611/EEC.
