Annexes I and II to that Regulation contain the models showing the required format of such application forms.\n(3) Annexes I-C and II-C to Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004 contain the list of competent authorities to which applications for national and Community action respectively must be submitted. Article 8 of the Regulation provides that the Commission must publish the list of departments within the customs authority, as referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003, in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union. As the lists in Annexes I-C and II-C contain information that is subject to change and needs to be regularly updated, it is more appropriate to publish them in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union. Annexes I-C and II-C to Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004 should therefore be deleted.\n(4) On 1 January 2007 Bulgaria and Romania acceded to the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004 should therefore be adapted to include reference to these countries in the Community application for action form which it contains.\n(5) The Community application for action form should have been adapted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1792/2006 of 23 October 2006 adapting certain regulations and decisions in the fields of free movement of goods, freedom of movement of persons, competition policy, agriculture (veterinary and phytosanitary legislation), fisheries, transport policy, taxation, statistics, social policy and employment, environment, customs union and external relations by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania\u00a0(3), which entered into force on the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of these countries.\n(6) In the interests of consistency, the Community application for action form should be adapted from the date of accession of Bulgaria and Romania.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
