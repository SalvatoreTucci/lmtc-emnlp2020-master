Article 2a of Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 provides that, as from 1 November 2003, olive trees and corresponding areas, the presence of which is not attested by an olive cultivation GIS established in accordance with Article 2 of that Regulation, cannot constitute a basis for aid to be paid to olive producers under the common market organisation in oils and fats.\n(2) Articles 23 to 26 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2383/2002(4), lay down rules for the application of the olive cultivation GIS and the conditions under which it may be deemed to have been completed at regional or national level.\n(3) More particularly, the third subparagraph of Article 26(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 provides for a procedure under which the Commission is to determine whether the olive cultivation GIS has been completed on the basis of a report from the Member State concerned. Given the fact that the creation of a GIS is to become a compulsory requirement for obtaining olive oil production aid, and in order to simplify administrative procedures to enable the GIS to be used rapidly and effectively, the requirement that that procedure be followed should be abolished.\n(4) However, the Member States' obligation to inform the Commission of the measures taken to create the olive cultivation GIS and of its completion should be maintained.\n(5) Article 26(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 should therefore be amended.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Article 26(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\"3.
