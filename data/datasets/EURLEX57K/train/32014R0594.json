Article 22(3) of that Regulation also requires the competent authority of the home Member State inform the competent authorities of the host Member States of the removal of a manager of a EuSEF from the register.\n(2) Taking into account that a dedicated IT tool for that notification has not yet been developed by ESMA, the use of e-mail is the most appropriate format for this type of notification among competent authorities and to ESMA. Therefore, a list of relevant e-mail addresses should be established by ESMA and made known to all competent authorities.\n(3) This Regulation is based on draft implementing technical standards submitted by ESMA to the Commission.\n(4) Given the limited scope and impact of the format for notification and taking into account that only competent authorities are to use the specific form established, ESMA did not conduct public consultations relating to introducing this format notification.
