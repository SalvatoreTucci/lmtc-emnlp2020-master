whereas, however, Article 18 of the Protocol with Cyprus provides that the volume of the tariff quota for that country must be increased by 5 % per year from the entry into force of the Protocol, and it will therefore be set at 60 tonnes for the 1990 to 1991 period;\nWhereas, within the limits of these tariff quotas, customs duties are to be phased out:\n- under the tariff quotas for Morocco, Jordan and Israel, according to the same timetables and under the same conditions as laid down in Articles 75 and 243 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,\n- under the tariff quota for Cyprus, according to the timetable and under the conditions laid down in Articles 5 and 16 of the abovementioned Protocol concerning Cyprus;\nWhereas within the limits of these tariff quotas, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic are to apply customs duties calculated in accordance with:\n- Council Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988 laying down the arrangements to be applied by Spain and Portugal to trade with Morocco and Syria (5) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the arrangements for trade between the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey (6) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 4162/87 of 21 December 1987 laying down arrangements for Spain's and Portugal's trade with Israel and amending Regulations (EEC) No 449/86 and (EEC) No 2573/87 (7) in respect of the tariff quotas opened for Morocco, Jordan and Israel,\nand\n- the Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the Community (8), in respect of the tariff quota opened for Cyprus;\nWhereas roses with large or small flowers and carnations of the unifloral or multifloral types are covered by the quotas only subject to the conditions laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel and Jordan (9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3551/88 (10);

whereas the necessary measures should be taken to provide for effective Community management of the quotas, so that the Member States may draw against the quotas such quantities as they may need, corresponding to actual imports;
