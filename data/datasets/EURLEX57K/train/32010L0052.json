In order to enhance the protection of operators it is appropriate to complete the requirements applicable under that Directive in order to cover all hazards listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) relating to machinery, not yet covered by the separate Directives under Directive 2003/37/EC.\n(3) With this amendment, Directive 2006/42/EC will no longer apply to tractors type-approved on the basis of the type-approval legislation for wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, since with the implementation of this amending Directive the risks covered by Directive 2003/37/EC will comprise all risks covered by Directive 2006/42/EC.\n(4) The European Committee for Standardisation CEN has formulated harmonised standards on roll-over protection for passengers and against hazardous substances. Those standards have been adopted and published and should therefore be incorporated in this Directive.\n(5) Directive 76/763/EEC imposes requirements with regard to the design and installation of passenger seats on agricultural tractors; it is appropriate to amend that Directive in order to increase this protection by including additional technical specifications providing protection covering the risks of passenger injury as described in Directive 2006/42/EC, in particular regarding roll-over and seatbelt anchorage for passenger seats.\n(6) Directive 2009/144/EC imposes technical requirements relating to certain components and characteristics of wheeled agricultural tractors; it is appropriate to amend that Directive in order to increase this protection by including additional technical specifications providing protection against falling objects, against penetration of objects into the cabin and against hazardous substances; furthermore the minimum requirements for the operator\u2019s manual should be set.\n(7) In order to achieve the smooth running of the type-approval process and in particular to enhance occupational safety, a minimum content for the operator\u2019s manual should be defined. This will ensure that operators have the necessary information to assess the adequacy of tractors to their intended uses, as well as for carrying out an appropriate maintenance.\n(8) Provisions for Falling Objects Protective Structures, if provided, Operators Protection Structures, if provided, and for the prevention of contact with hazardous substances should be required according to the state of the art.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress \u2014 Agricultural Tractors,", "main_body": ["Directive 76/763/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.", "Directive 2009/144/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from the date of entry into force, with respect to vehicles which comply with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/763/EEC and Directive 2009/144/EC as amended by this Directive, Member States shall not, on grounds relating to the subject matter of these Directives:\n(a) refuse to grant EC type-approval or to grant national type-approval; or\n(b) prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of such a vehicle.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 year after the date of entry into force, with respect to new types of vehicles which do not comply with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/763/EEC and Directive 2009/144/EC as amended by this Directive, and on grounds relating to the subject matter of these Directives, Member States:\n(a) shall refuse to grant EC type-approval; and\n(b) may refuse to grant national type-approval.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 2 years after the date of entry into force, with respect to new vehicles which do not comply with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/763/EEC and Directive 2009/144/EC as amended by this Directive, and on grounds relating to the subject matter of these Directives, Member States:\n(a) shall consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with Directive 2003/37/EC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC; and\n(b) may refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of those vehicles.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1\u00a0March 2011 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
