Such penalty may not be less than ECU 500 nor more than ECU 20 000,\n- if the communication referred to in the first subparagraph is made after 31 May but before 16 June, the penalty shall be equal to the amount of the levy due for a 0,2 % overrun on the quantities of milk and milk equivalent delivered to them by producers.
