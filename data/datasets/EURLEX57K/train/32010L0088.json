With new rules on the place of supply of services which favour taxation at the place of consumption, the possibilities for exploiting differences in VAT rates through relocation have been limited further and potential distortions of competition reduced.\n(3) To prevent a growing divergence in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States from leading to structural imbalances in the European Union and distortions of competition in some sectors of activity, it is common practice in the field of indirect taxes to set minimum rates. It is still necessary to do so for VAT.\n(4) Pending the outcome of consultations on a new VAT strategy which is expected to address future arrangements and corresponding levels of harmonisation, it would be premature to set a permanent standard rate level or to consider changing the minimum rate level.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to maintain the current minimum standard rate at 15\u00a0% for a further period long enough to ensure legal certainty, while allowing further review.\n(6) This does not preclude a further revision of VAT legislation before 31 December 2015 to address the outcome of the new VAT strategy.\n(7) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(2), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(8) Directive 2006/112/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 97 of Directive 2006/112/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 97\nFrom 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2015, the standard rate may not be lower than 15\u00a0%.\u2019.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 2011 at the latest.
