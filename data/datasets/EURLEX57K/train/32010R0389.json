These regularisations were considered as an extension of the development plans that had been presented for the outermost regions concerned.\n(4) A more recent and comprehensive inventory of the small-scale fleets operating in the most remote areas of the French outermost regions of Guyana and Martinique made by the French authorities has shown that the number of vessels requiring regularisation was underestimated at the time of the above-mentioned review of the reference levels. France has requested that a new regularisation be done for the unaccounted vessels as part of the development plans presented in 2007 for Guyana and Martinique.\n(5) The fleet segments concerned by the request for increase in reference level target their activities on coastal fish resources which, according to the most recent scientific information, do not show conservation concerns.\n(6) In order to contribute to the sustainable development of the fisheries sector in outermost regions, it is therefore appropriate to consider the need for regularisation of the concerned vessels in the framework of the development plans concerned and to increase the corresponding reference levels in order to allow the registration of these vessels in the EU Fleet Register.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2104/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2104/2004 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0102, 7.4.2004, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0365, 10.12.2004, p.\u00a019.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0284, 30.10.2007, p.\u00a06.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Council Document No 11823/06 ADD 1, 20 July 2006.\nANNEX\nIn Section \u2018France\u2019 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2104/2004, the entries concerning fleet segment \u2018French Guiana.
