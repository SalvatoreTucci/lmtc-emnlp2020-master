In that report it came to the conclusion that the extension of uses of the oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. as a food ingredient was acceptable.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 25 September 2008.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) In their objections Member States raised concerns about elevated intake levels of omega-3 fatty acids and in particular DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).\n(6) However, the main source of omega-3 fatty acids is fish-oil. In the foods of the categories for which the addition oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. was requested omega-3 fatty acids can be provided either from fish oil or alternatively from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp.\n(7) Therefore it is not expected that the use of oil from micro-algae in the food groups mentioned in the Annex will lead to an unacceptable increase of the overall intake of omega-3 fatty acids.\n(8) The oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp. as specified in Commission Decision 2003/427/EC\u00a0(2) may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient for the uses and at the maximum levels as listed in the Annex.", "The designation \u2018oil from the micro-algae Schizochytrium sp.\u2019 shall be displayed in the list of ingredients of the foodstuffs containing it.", "This Decision is addressed to Martek Biosciences Corporation, 6480 Dobbin Road, Columbia, MD 21045, USA."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 144, 12.6.2003, p. 13.\nANNEX\nUSES OF OIL FROM THE MICRO-ALGAE SCHIZOCHYTRIUM SP.\nUse group Maximum content of DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid)\nBakery products (breads and bread rolls) 200 mg/100 g\nCereal bars 500 mg/100 g\nNon-alcoholic beverages (including milk based beverages) 60 mg/100 ml"}
