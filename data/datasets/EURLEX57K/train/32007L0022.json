In view of the absence of interest from stakeholders to defend the use of these substances and the opinion of the SCCP regarding the necessity to reduce the exposure to iodine from cosmetic products, the authorisations should be withdrawn.\n(4) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes IV and VI to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that from 18 October 2008 no cosmetic products which fail to comply with this Directive are placed on the market by Community manufacturers or by importers established within the Community.\nMember States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that those products are not sold or disposed of to the final consumer after 18 April 2009.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 18 January 2008 at the latest.
