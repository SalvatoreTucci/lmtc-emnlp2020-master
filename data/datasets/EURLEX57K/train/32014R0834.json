For the application of that framework, rules need to be laid down which ensure a comprehensive and regular assessment of the progress, effectiveness and efficiency of the CAP against objectives. In order to allow Member States and the Commission to put in place a consistent monitoring and evaluation framework, a set of common indicators as referred to in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should be laid down.\n(2) Those indicators should be linked to the structure and objectives of the CAP and be based on measurable elements. Therefore, different types of indicators should be laid down in order to allow for the assessment of the CAP at all levels. Impact indicators should reflect the common main objectives of the CAP as set out in Article\u00a0110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For each of those common main objectives more specific objectives can be identified, for which result indicators need to be laid down. Those specific objectives include farm income and farm income variability, improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, market stability, consumer expectations, provision of public goods and environmental preservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation and maintenance of a diverse agriculture, as well as the specific objectives defined for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), namely the Union priorities for rural development. In addition, the practical implementation of the CAP instruments should be monitored on the basis of output indicators that are able to reflect this operational level of the CAP.\n(3) It is important to ensure that the monitoring and evaluation framework can be used by Member States and the Commission efficiently and at the appropriate time. It should therefore be provided that Member States send the information necessary for the monitoring and evaluation of the CAP within the deadlines set by the relevant Regulations. With a view to avoiding any undue administrative burden, the Commission should, to the extent possible, use information already made available to it,\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Indicators\nThe indicators allowing for the assessment of the progress, effectiveness and efficiency of the common agricultural policy (CAP) against its objectives as referred to in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 shall be measurable.
