On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia acceded to the European Union.\n(3) At the Euro-Med Trade Ministerial Meeting in Toledo of March 2002, Ministers agreed upon the extension of this system to the Mediterranean countries, other than Turkey, which participate in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, based on the Barcelona Declaration adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held on 27 and 28 November 1995. At the Euro-Med Trade Ministerial Meeting in Palermo, on 7 July 2003, the Ministers, with a view to allowing such an extension, endorsed a new pan-Euro-Mediterranean model of Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements, concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation. Further to the outcome of the EC-Faroe Islands/Denmark Joint Committee of 28 November 2003, it has been agreed to include also the Faroe Islands in the system of pan-Euro-Mediterranean diagonal cumulation of origin.\n(4) Decisions of the respective Association Council or Joint Committee introducing the new pan-Euro-Mediterranean Protocol in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements and in the Agreement between the EC and the Faroe Islands/Denmark have already been, or will be, adopted.\n(5) The application of that new system of diagonal cumulation implies using new types of proof of preferential origin, consisting in movement certificates EUR-MED and invoice declarations EUR-MED. Regulation (EC) No 1207/2001 should therefore cover also those types of proofs of preferential origin.\n(6) To allow a correct determination of the originating status of products and properly support the establishment of the proofs of origin in that new context, the supplier's declaration for products having preferential originating status should incorporate an additional statement showing whether diagonal cumulation has been applied and with what countries.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1207/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1207/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
