For a transitional period expiring on 24 August 2005, farmers are allowed to use a limited proportion of conventional feedingstuffs where they can show that organic feedingstuffs are unavailable.\n(2) It appears that there will not be a supply of sufficient quantities to fill the demand for organic feed materials in the Community after 24 August 2005, especially as concerns feed materials rich in proteins needed to sustain production for monogastric animals and, to a lesser extent, for ruminants.\n(3) It is therefore necessary to provide for an extension of the transitional period during which the use of conventional feedingstuffs may be authorised.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) Considering the urgency of the measure due to the fact that the provision on the use of conventional feedingstuffs expires on 24 August 2005, this Regulation should enter into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 25 August 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
