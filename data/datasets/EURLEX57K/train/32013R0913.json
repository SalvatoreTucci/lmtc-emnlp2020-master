That subcategory includes fruit or vegetable spreads similar to jams, jellies and marmalades as defined by Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut pur\u00e9e intended for human consumption\u00a0(3). The application was subsequently made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.\n(5) Directive 2001/113/EC describes and defines jams, jellies and marmalades. Fruit or vegetable spreads, similar to jams, jellies and marmalades, which fall within food subcategory 04.2.5.3, may contain ingredients other than those listed in Annex II of Directive 2001/113/EC (e.g. vitamins, minerals and flavourings).\n(6) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 authorises the use of the sweeteners Acesulfame K (E 950), Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts (E 952), Saccharin and its Na, K and Ca salts (E 954), Sucralose (E 955), Neohesperidine DC (E 959) and Steviol glycosides (E 960) in energy-reduced jams, jellies and marmalades, as well as in other similar fruit spreads as dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads that are energy-reduced or with no added sugar.\n(7) An extension of use of those sweeteners to all other energy-reduced similar fruit or vegetable spreads will allow their use in a similar way as in energy-reduced jams, jellies and marmalades.\n(8) As fruit or vegetable spreads are used as an alternative to jams, jellies and marmalades, the use of sweeteners in those spreads will not lead to an additional exposure of the consumer and therefore is not of safety concern.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where such update is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the extension of use of Acesulfame K (E 950), Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts (E 952), Saccharin and its Na, K and Ca salts (E 954), Sucralose (E 955), Neohesperidine DC (E 959) and Steviol glycosides (E 960) to all other energy-reduced similar fruit or vegetable spreads constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(10) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 September 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 10, 12.1.2002, p. 67.\nANNEX\nPart E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) The entry in food subcategory 04.2.5.3 \u2018Other similar fruit or vegetable spreads\u2019 for E 950 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 950 Acesulfame K 1\u00a0000  only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\u2019\n(2) The entries in food subcategory 04.2.5.3 \u2018Other similar fruit or vegetable spreads\u2019 for E 952, E 954, E 955, E 959 and E 960 are replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 952 Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts 500 (51) only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nE 954 Saccharin and its Na, K and Ca salts 200 (52) only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nE 955 Sucralose 400  only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nE 959 Neohesperidine DC 50  only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nE 960 Steviol glycosides 200 (60) only energy-reduced fruit or vegetable spreads and dried-fruit-based sandwich spreads, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\u2019"}
