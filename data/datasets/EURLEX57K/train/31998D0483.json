Energy saving\nDishwashers with 10 or more place settings must have an energy efficiency index lower than 0,76 as defined in Commission Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.\nThe appliance will thus qualify for either energy efficiency class A or B as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV.\nDishwashers with less than 10 place settings must have an energy efficiency index lower than 0,88 as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.\nThe appliance will thus qualify for either energy efficiency class A, B or C as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV.\n2. Water saving\nThe water consumption of the dishwasher (expressed as W(measured)) shall be lower or equal to the threshold as defined by the equation below:\nW(measured) &le; 0,6 s + 11,2\nwhere:\nW(measured) = the measured water consumption of the dishwasher in litres per cycle, expressed to the first decimal,\ns = the applicable number of standard place settings of the dishwasher.\nThe water consumption shall be measured using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.\n3. Prevention of excessive use of detergent\nThe appliance shall have clear volumetric markings on the detergent dispenser allowing the user to adjust the detergent quantity used according to the type and amount of load and its degree of soiling (see also criterion 5.1.g).\nBEST PRACTICE CRITERIA\n4. Appliance design\n1. The appliance shall allow the user to select a programme for washing a standard load using detergents that work best at temperatures lower than 65 \uc9f8C, i.e. 55 \uc9f8 or 50 \uc9f8C.\n2. The appliance shall have clear markings identifying the appropriate settings for the programmes available (e.g. standard, low-temperature, half-load, lightly or heavily soiled load, etc.).\n3. Where applicable, the appliance shall allow the salt dosing to be adjusted to the local water hardness, and shall have a salt refill indicator.\n5. User instructions\nThe appliance shall be sold with an instruction manual which provides advice on the correct environmental use and, in particular:\n1. Recommendations for optimal use of energy, water and additives (detergent, salt, etc.) in the operation of the appliance, including:\n(a) Guidelines on the proper installation of the dishwasher and, if hot-fill is available on the machine, advice on the fuel best used for home water heating.\n(b) Advice to adjust the salt dosing to the local water hardness, if applicable.\n(c) Advice to use a full load whenever possible.\n(d) Advice to avoid rinsing items before placing them in the dishwasher.\n(e) Advice on the best use of the rinse and hold option, if available.\n(f) Advice on the availability of detergents that work best at temperatures lower than 65 \uc9f8C and have the potential to save energy.\n(g) Advice on varying the detergent dose according to the type and amount of the load and its degree of soil (for example: a half load requires less detergent). Reference shall be made to the markings in the detergent dispenser.\n(h) Information about the energy and water consumption of the dishwasher for the different programmes, allowing the consumer to identify an appropriate programme to make the least use of energy and water.\n(i) Advice that the dishwasher should not be left in the 'on`-position when it has completed its cycle, because of possible standby energy losses. The instruction manual shall state the time needed to complete the programmes available.\n(j) Information about the cleaning and drying performance of the dishwasher, with reference to the energy-label classes.\n(k) Advice on appropriate maintenance of the dishwasher, including the regular cleaning of filters and removal of deposits.\n(l) Information that ignoring the issues mentioned above can lead to higher consumption of energy, water and/or detergent and thus can increase the running costs and lead to poor results.\n2. Information about those parts and materials of the dishwasher which are reusable and/or recyclable.\n3. Advice that when disposing of the dishwasher the consumer should enquire about and follow the applicable waste management route.\n6. Recycling\nPlastic parts weighing more than 50 g must have a permanent marking identifying the material, in conformity with ISO 1043.\nExcluded from this criterion are extruded plastic materials.\nPERFORMANCE CRITERIA\n7. Cleaning performance\nThe dishwasher must have a cleaning performance index of more than 0,88 as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.\nThe dishwasher will thus qualify for either cleaning performance class A, B or C as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV.\n8. Drying performance\nThe dishwasher must have a drying performance index of more than 0,78 as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.\nThe dishwasher will thus qualify for either drying performance class A, B or C as defined in Directive 97/17/EC, Annex IV.\n9. Noise emissions\nAirborne noise from the appliance, counted as sound power, shall not exceed 55 dB (A) for free standing models and 51 dB (A) for built-in models.\nThe measurement of the noise level shall be in accordance with Council Directive 86/594/EEC (1), using the standards prescribed in standard EN 50242.\n10. Noise information\nInformation about the noise level of the machine shall be provided in a way clearly visible to the consumer. This shall be done by the incorporation of this information in the energy label for dishwashers.\nThe information relating to noise shall be measured in accordance with Directive 86/594/EEC, using the standards prescribed in standard EN 50242.\nTESTING\n11. Testing laboratories\nThe testing shall be performed at the expense of the applicant by laboratories that meet the general requirements stressed in the standards EN 45001 and that have experience with the testing of dishwashers.\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nThe following text shall be provided in such a way as to be clearly visible to consumers (next to the label, whenever possible).\n- This product qualifies for the European Union eco-label because it is efficient with energy and water.\n- Additional information on how to minimise environmental impacts is given in the instruction manual.\n(1) OJ L 344, 6. 12. 1986, p. 24."}
