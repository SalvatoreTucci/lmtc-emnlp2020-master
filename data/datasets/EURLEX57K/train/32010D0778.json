In order to fully account for Denmark\u2019s special and unique situation, which was recognised by the Council in 2002 in the process leading to the adoption of Decision 2002/358/EC, resulting from its unusually low base-year emissions and its having one of the highest quantified emission reduction obligations pursuant to Annex II to that Decision, the Union should transfer five million assigned amount units to Denmark for the sole purpose of compliance with the commitments in the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Commission has taken due consideration of Denmark\u2019s commitment to cancel any allowances remaining from this transfer at the end of the first commitment period.\n(5) Decision 2006/944/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/944/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
