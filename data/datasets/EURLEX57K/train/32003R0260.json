The SSC indicated however that culling sheep of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype would carry little risk-reducing benefit. In order to avoid discouraging the reporting of the disease and to safeguard breeds which may have a low level of resistance, this culling should be achieved gradually.\n(2) In the interests of consistency with such rules for the culling of sheep, the rules for intra-Community trade in breeding sheep should be amended to remove scrapie-related restrictions from trade in sheep of the ARR/ARR genotype.\n(3) In its opinion of 16 May 2002 on the safety of bovine embryos, the SSC concluded that there is no need for measures other than those prescribed by the International Embryo Transfer Society Protocols. In its general session of May 2002, the World Animal Health Organisation (Office International des Epizooties (OIE)) decided on similar scientific grounds to delete all trade conditions related to bovine embryos and ova. BSE-related trade conditions for bovine embryos and ova in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be deleted, and Commission Decision 92/290/EEC of 14 May 1992 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom(5), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, should be repealed.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes VII, VIII and XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Decision 92/290/EEC is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nPoint 2(b) of Annex VII and point (a)(iii) of part I of Chapter A of Annex VIII shall apply from 1 October 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 February 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(2) OJ L 62, 15.3.1993, p. 49.\n(3) OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 225, 22.8.2002, p. 3.\n(5) OJ L 152, 4.6.1992, p. 37.\nANNEX\nAnnexes VII, VIII and XI are amended as follows:\n1. Annex VII is replaced by the following:\n\"ANNEX VII\nERADICATION OF TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY\n1. The inquiry referred to in Article 13(1)(b) must identify:\n(a) in the case of bovine animals:\n- all other ruminants on the holding of the animal in which the disease was confirmed,\n- where the disease was confirmed in a female animal, its progeny born within two years prior to, or after, clinical onset of the disease,\n- all animals of the cohort of the animal in which the disease was confirmed,\n- the possible origin of the disease,\n- other animals on the holding of the animal in which the disease was confirmed or on other holdings, which may have become infected by the TSE agent or been exposed to the same feed or contamination source,\n- the movement of potentially contaminated feedingstuffs, of other material or any other means of transmission, which may have transmitted the TSE agent to or from the holding in question;\n(b) in the case of ovine and caprine animals:\n- all ruminants other than ovine and caprine animals on the holding of the animal in which the disease was confirmed,\n- in so far as they are identifiable, the parents, all embryos, ova and the last progeny of the animal in which the disease was confirmed,\n- all other ovine and caprine animals on the holding of the animal in which the disease was confirmed in addition to those mentioned in the second indent,\n- the possible origin of the disease and the identification of other holdings on which there are animals, embryos or ova which may have become infected by the TSE agent or been exposed to the same feed or contamination source,\n- the movement of potentially contaminated feedingstuffs, other material or any other means of transmission, which may have transmitted the BSE agent to or from the holding in question.\n2. The measures laid down in Article 13(1)(c) shall comprise at least:\n(a) in case of confirmation of BSE in a bovine animal, the killing and complete destruction of bovine animals identified by the inquiry referred to in point 1(a), first, second and third indent. The Member State may decide not to kill and destroy all bovine animals on the holding of the animal in which the disease was confirmed as referred to in the first indent of point 1(a), depending upon the epidemiological situation and traceability of the animals on that holding;\n(b) in the case of confirmation of TSE in an ovine or caprine animal, from 1 October 2003, according to the decision of the competent authority:\n(i) either the killing and complete destruction of all animals, embryos and ova identified by the inquiry referred to in the second and third indents of point 1(b); or\n(ii) the killing and complete destruction of all animals, embryos and ova identified by the inquiry referred to in the second and third indents of point 1(b), with the exception of:\n- breeding rams of the ARR/ARR genotype,\n- breeding ewes carrying at least 1 ARR allele and no VRQ allele, and\n- sheep carrying at least one ARR allele which are intended solely for slaughter,\n(iii) if the infected animal has been introduced from another holding, a Member State may decide, based on the history of the case, to apply eradication measures in the holding of origin in addition to, or instead of, the holding in which the infection was confirmed. In the case of land used for common grazing by more than one flock, Member States may decide to limit the application of the measures to a single flock, based on a consideration of all the epidemiological factors,\n(c) in case of confirmation of BSE in an ovine or caprine animal, killing and complete destruction of all animals, embryos and ova identified by the inquiry referred to in the second to fifth indents of point 1(b).\n3.1. Only the following animals may be introduced to the holding(s) where destruction has been undertaken in accordance with point 2(b)(i) or (ii):\n(a) male sheep of the ARR/ARR genotype;\n(b) female sheep carrying at least 1 ARR allele and no VRQ allele;\n(c) Caprine animals, provided that:\n- no ovine animals other than those of the ARR/ARR genotype are present on the holding,\n- thorough cleaning and disinfection of all animal housing on the premises has been carried out following de-stocking,\n- the holding shall be subjected to intensified TSE monitoring, including the testing of all culled and dead-on-farm caprine animals over the age of 18 months.\n3.2. Only the following ovine germinal products may be used in the holding(s) where destruction has been undertaken in accordance with point 2(b)(i) or (ii):\n(a) semen from rams of the ARR/ARR genotype;\n(b) embryos carrying at least 1 ARR allele and no VRQ allele.\n4. During a transitional period until 1 January 2006 at the latest, and by way of derogation from the restriction set out in point 3(b), where it is difficult to obtain replacement ovine animals of a known genotype, Member States may decide to allow non-pregnant ewe lambs of an unknown genotype to be introduced to the holdings referred to in point 2(b)(i) and (ii).\n5. Following the application on a holding of the measures referred to in point 2(b)(i) and (ii):\n(a) movement of ARR/ARR sheep from the holding shall not be subject to any restriction;\n(b) sheep carrying only one ARR allele may be moved from the holding only to go directly for slaughter for human consumption or for the purposes of destruction;\n(c) sheep of other genotypes may only be moved from the holding for the purposes of destruction.\n6. The restrictions referred to in points 3 and 5 shall continue to apply to the holding for a period of three years from:\n(a) the date of attainment of ARR/ARR status by all ovine animals on the holding; or\n(b) the last date when any ovine or caprine animal was kept on the premises; or\n(c) in the case of point 3.1(c), the date when the intensified TSE monitoring commenced.\n7. Where the frequency of the ARR allele within the breed or holding is low, or where it is deemed necessary in order to avoid inbreeding, a Member State may decide to:\n(a) delay the destruction of animals as referred to in point 2(b)(i) and (ii) for up to two breeding years;\n(b) allow ovine animals other than those specified in point 3 to be introduced to the holdings referred to in point 2(b)(i) and (ii), provided that they do not carry a VRQ allele.\n8. Members States applying the derogations referred to in points 4 and 7 shall notify to the Commission an account of the conditions and criteria used for granting them.\"\n2.
