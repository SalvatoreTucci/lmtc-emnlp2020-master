According to information supplied by the Member State, only 46000 hectares have so far been converted and, at the current rate of conversion under the scheme, only an estimated total of 64000 hectares will be converted by 31 December 2002, the date on which the scheme terminates, rather than the 200000 hectares provided for in Article 1 of the Regulation. In order to permit the objective set for the scheme to be achieved more fully, Portugal should be authorised to continue with the conversion scheme for three further years.\n(2) Since a time limit was placed on the programme, Regulation (EC) No 1017/94 lays down that the specific reserve and any rights not yet allocated should lapse at the end of the programme. It should therefore be laid down that the specific reserve and any rights not yet allocated lapse at the end of the additional period of three years.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1017/94 should therefore be amended,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1017/94 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
