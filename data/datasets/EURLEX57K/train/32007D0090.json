The new formulation of the technical parameters would therefore ease the take-up of these systems in the EU.\n(2) Both ETSI and the CEPT have confirmed that the amendment to these technical parameters does not change the protection vis-\u00e0-vis the other services sharing the spectrum with WAS/RLANs and keeps in particular the aggregate interference from RLANs operating in the frequency band 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350 MHz to a level sufficiently low so that interference to satellite communications would be avoided.\n(3) The Harmonised Standard for RLAN equipment using the 5 GHz bands which has been adopted by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) under number EN 301\u00a0893 takes account of this simplification of technical parameters.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["Article 4(1) of Decision 2005/513/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 4\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the frequency band 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350 MHz, WAS/RLANs shall be restricted to indoor use with a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW.
