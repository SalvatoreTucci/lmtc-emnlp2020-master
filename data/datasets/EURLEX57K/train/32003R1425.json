Maximum levels have been established for nitrates, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, lead, cadmium, mercury, 3-MCPD and dioxins.\n(2) Some Member States have adopted, or plan to adopt, maximum levels for patulin in fruit juices in particular apple juice, solid apple products such as apple compote and apple puree and in such products intended for infants and young children. In view of the disparities between Member States and the consequent risk of distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary in order to ensure market unity while abiding by the principle of proportionality.\n(3) Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by fungi belonging to several genera, including Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys species. Although patulin can occur in many mouldy fruits, grains and other foods, the major sources of patulin contamination are apple products.\n(4) The Scientific Committee for Food endorsed in its meeting on 8 March 2000 the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 0,4 \u00ce\u017ag/kg body weight (bw) for patulin.\n(5) In 2001, a specific task \"Assessment of the dietary intake of patulin by the population of EU Member States\" in the framework of Council Directive 1993/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food(4) (SCOOP) has been performed. It can be concluded from the assessment that the average exposure seems to be quite below the PMTDI of 0,4 \u00ce\u017ag/kg bw. Nevertheless taking into consideration specific groups of consumers, especially small children, and assuming worst cases, the exposure to patulin is more significant but still below the PMTDI.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. In Article 5, the following paragraph is added:\n\"4.
