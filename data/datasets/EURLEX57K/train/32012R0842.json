That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation lanthanum carbonate octahydrate CAS number 6487-39-4 as a feed additive for dogs, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10 years for cats by Commission Regulation (EC) No 163/2008\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation of lanthanum carbonate octahydrate, CAS number 6487-39-4, for dogs. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 6 March 2012 that, under the proposed conditions of use, lanthanum carbonate octahydrate does not have an adverse effect on the target species\u00a0(3). It further concluded that lanthanum carbonate octahydrate has the potential to reduce the phosphorus bioavailability in adult dogs. It could not, however, comment on the long-term effects. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of lanthanum carbonate octahydrate, CAS number 6487-39-4, shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation. It is appropriate to provide for post-market monitoring as regards long-term adverse effects.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018other zootechnical additives\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 September 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 50, 23.2.2008, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(3):2618.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
