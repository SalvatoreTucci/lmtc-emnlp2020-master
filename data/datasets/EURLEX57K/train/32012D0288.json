Gamma-Cyclodextrin is a digestible carbohydrate to be added to foods.\n(2) On 9 July 2010 the competent food assessment body of Ireland issued its initial assessment report. In this report it came to the conclusion that the company Wacker Chemie GmbH had provided sufficient information to authorise the placing on the market of \u03b3-Cyclodextrin as a novel food ingredient.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 19 July 2010.\n(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections were raised in accordance with that provision. In particular, objections which concerned the absorption of fat soluble vitamins were raised. In accordance with the provisions of Article 7(1) a Commission Implementing Decision is required that takes into account the objections raised. Additional explanations by the applicant alleviated these concerns to the satisfaction of Member States and the Commission.\n(5) The intentional addition of \u03b3-Cyclodextrin to food for technological purposes falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives\u00a0(2) and should be authorised in accordance with that regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Gamma-Cyclodextrin as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market as a novel food ingredient.", "The designation of \u03b3-Cyclodextrin authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018Gamma-Cyclodextrin\u2019 or \u2018\u03b3-Cyclodextrin\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Wacker Chemie AG, Hanns Seidel Platz 4, 81737 M\u00fcnchen, Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\nANNEX\nSPECIFICATIONS OF \u03b3-CYCLODEXTRIN\nSynonyms\n\u03b3-cyclodextrin, \u03b3-dextrin, cyclooctaamylose, cyclomaltooctaose, \u03b3-cycloamylase\nDefinition\nA non-reducing cyclic saccharide consisting of eight \u03b1-1,4-linked D-glucopyranosyl units produced by the action of cyclodextrin glucosyltransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) on hydrolysed starch.
