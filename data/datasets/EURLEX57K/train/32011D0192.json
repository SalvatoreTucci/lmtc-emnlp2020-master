In this respect, the Commission launched an enquiry in accordance with the Article 12 of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs.\n(6) In accordance with Article 12(3) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, the Hungarian authorities were invited to a bilateral discussion on 8 November 2005, at which both parties endeavoured to reach an agreement as to the action to be taken and on an evaluation of the gravity of the infringement.\n(7) Following the bilateral discussion, the Commission still considered that certain items of expenditure had not been carried out in conformity with the rules governing the Sapard programme. For some of the payments made in the financial years 2003 and 2004, Hungary breached the 3-month deadline for payments to beneficiaries provided in Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs. According to this provision, the interval between receipt of the supporting documents needed to make the payment and issuing of the payment order should not have exceeded 3 months.\n(8) By letter of 16 October 2009, the Hungarian authorities initiated a conciliation procedure in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 12(3) of Section A and Item 9 of Section F of the Annex to the MAFAs. The Conciliation Body supported the arguments presented by the Hungarian authorities and considered them as exceptional circumstances to derogate from the deadline for the payments to beneficiaries given by provision of Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs.\n(9) The Commission could not consider the arguments given by the Hungarian authorities as exceptional circumstances, justifying some derogation from Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs, and proposed the amount of EUR\u00a02\u00a0535\u00a0286 for financial reduction.\n(10) In accordance with Article 12(7) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, the amount to be recovered shall be communicated to the National Authorising Officer who should, on behalf of Hungary, ensure that the amount is credited to the Sapard euro account within 2 months of the date that the Decision is taken. However, due to the fact that the implementation of the Sapard programme is finalised, the recovery of the sum excluded shall be executed in a form of a recovery order,", "main_body": ["The amount of EUR\u00a02\u00a0535\u00a0286 paid by the Hungarian Sapard Agency is hereby excluded from EU financing as the underlying transactions do not comply with the rules governing the Sapard programme.\nThe calculation of the correction is indicated in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Hungary."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 March 2011.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 87.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 7.10.2000, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 258, 5.8.2004, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 68.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 72, 11.3.2004, p. 64.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 80.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 69, 9.3.2007, p. 5.\nANNEX\nTABLE OF REDUCTIONS\nDelay Total expenditure in FY2004 Use of 4\u00a0% reserve Amount subject to reduction Red.
