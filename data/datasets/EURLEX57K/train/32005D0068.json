It further defined the EU Battle Groups concept on 14 June 2004.\n(4) The European Council on 17 June 2004 endorsed a Report on ESDP which underlined that work on EU Rapid Response capacities should be taken forward with a view to an initial operational capability by early 2005.\n(5) In view of these developments, the early financing of EU military operations should be improved, in particular in view of Rapid Response operations. The new scheme for the early financing is therefore intended first and foremost for Rapid Response operations; under specific circumstances, a contribution paid in anticipation may however be used for the early financing of a regular operation, in particular one with a short delay between the adoption of the Joint Action to take action and the decision to launch the operation.\n(6) Decision 2004/197/CFSP should therefore be amended,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/197/CFSP is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
