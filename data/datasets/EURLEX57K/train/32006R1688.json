Subquota III concerns third countries other than the United States and Canada. It is divided into four quarterly tranches. Tranche No 4 covers the period 1 October to 31 December.\n(2) Under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, licences issued pursuant to that Regulation are valid for 45 days from the day of issue.\n(3) Under the third subparagraph of Article 5(1) and point (a) of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, import licences mention a single country of origin and are valid only for the products originating in that country.\n(4) From 1 October 2006, the pattern of imports into the European Community of common wheat originating in Ukraine has been disturbed by the introduction by Ukraine of control measures and limits on its exports. This might prevent operators from complying with their undertakings as regards import licences issued with Ukraine as the country of origin, at least in part.\n(5) To avoid penalising these operators, and to ensure the proper execution of this quota, a certain degree of flexibility should be introduced as regards the use of the licences issued. To this end, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, the period of validity those licences should be extended until the end of 2006 and their use should be authorised for the import of common wheat originating in third countries other than Ukraine, with the exception of the United States and Canada.\n(6) Import licences issued for imports of common wheat of a quality other than high quality (CN code 1001\u00a090\u00a099) under subquota III (serial number 09.4125) referred to in Article 3 of the above Regulation from 1 October 2006 will expire from 16 November 2006. The amendments provided for in this Regulation should therefore apply as soon as possible. This Regulation should therefore enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, the period of validity of import licences issued for imports of common wheat of a quality other than high quality (CN code 1001\u00a090\u00a099) under subquota III (serial number 09.4125) referred to in Article 3 of that Regulation between 1 October 2006 and 16 November 2006, bearing in Section 8 \u2018Ukraine\u2019 as the country of origin, may be extended until 31 December 2006 at the request of licence holders.
