whereas that method takes account of the conversion rate, processing costs and the value of by-products and an amount for the protection of industry; whereas the day of importation should be fixed as the date of acceptance of the declaration by the customs authorities as laid down in Article 67 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden;\nWhereas Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff shall be levied on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation when they are imported; whereas, however, in the case of products referred to in Article 11 (2) the import duty will be equal to the intervention price valid for those products on importation, increased by a certain percentage according to whether it is husked or milled rice, indica rice or japonica rice, and minus the import price, provided that duty does not exceed the rate of the Common Customs Tariff duties;\nWhereas there are particular difficulties in the rice sector concerning the verification of the value of imported products; whereas a system of flat-rate values is therefore most suitable for the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of negotiations; whereas, however, technical discussions between the partners concerned are still in progress; whereas, pending the outcome of those discussions, the system applied in 1995/96 should be maintained as a precaution;\nWhereas in order to classify the consignments imported, the products referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be subdivided into a number of qualities; whereas the combined nomenclature codes to which these qualities correspond must therefore be specified;\nWhereas, for the purposes of calculating the import duty using the flat-rate import value, the representative cif import prices should be calculated for each of the qualities defined; whereas, for the purposes of establishing those prices, price quotations for the different qualities of rice must be specified; whereas these quotations should therefore be defined;\nWhereas, in the interests of clarity and transparency, the quotations for the different types of rice in publications by the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America constitute an objective basis for establishing representative cif import prices for rice in bulk; whereas representative prices on the United States market, the Thai market or of other origins may be converted into representative cif import prices by adding the maritime freight costs on the charter market between the ports of origin and the Community port; whereas, taking account of the volume of freight and of trade in the ports of northern Europe, those ports constitute the Community destination for which the quotations of maritime freight prices are best known publicly, are most transparent and most easily available; whereas, therefore, the ports of northern Europe (Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Gent) should be adopted as the Community destination ports;\nWhereas, in order to monitor the trends in representative cif import prices thus established, it is appropriate to provide for weekly monitoring of the elements contributing to their calculation;\nWhereas, for the purposes of fixing import duties for the rice referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, a period of two weeks for determining representative cif import prices for rice in bulk takes account of market trends without introducing elements of uncertainty; whereas, on this basis, import duties for that product should be established taking account of the average of representative cif import prices noted over the abovementioned period, every two weeks on a Wednesday, and on the last working day of each month;\nWhereas the import duty thus calculated can be applied over a two-week period without substantially affecting import prices, duties paid; whereas, however, where no quotation is available for a given product over the period of calculation of representative cif import prices or where, following sudden changes in the elements making up the calculation, those representative cif import prices undergo major fluctuations during the period in question, measures must be taken in order to maintain the representative nature of the cif import prices of the product concerned;\nWhereas the price of basmati rice originating in India and Pakistan is normally higher on the market than the established representative price; whereas in 1993/94 the difference was of the order of ECU 250 per tonne in the case of basmati rice originating in India and ECU 50 per tonne in the case of basmati rice originating in Pakistan; whereas, as a result, the import duty on those rice varieties should be reduced by the aforementioned amounts in order to comply with the principle laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and the Community's international commitments;\nWhereas, where there is no quotation, it is appropriate to continue to apply the amount of duty fixed for the preceding period and, in the case of major fluctuations in the quotation, the cost of maritime freight or the exchange rate used for the calculation of the representative cif import price of the product concerned, the representative nature of that price must be restored, taking account of those changes, by adjusting the duty fixed in line with the difference noted; whereas, even where such adjustments are made, the regular dates for fixing duties will not be affected;\nWhereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The import duties referred to in Article 11 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 shall be those applicable at the time laid down in Article 67 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.", "The import duty for milled rice falling within CN code 1006 30 shall be equal to the intervention price valid at the moment of import increased by:\n- 163 % in the case of indica rice,\n- 167 % in the case of japonica rice,\nminus the import price.\nHowever, that duty must not exceed the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.", "1.

It shall be issued pursuant to the relevant provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 81/92 (4).\nThe amounts provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be revised in response to market trends.", "1.
