whereas, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, the common commercial policy shall apply to the Canary Islands, without prejudice to the specific measures referred to in Article 6 (3) thereof;\nWhereas paragraph 7.2 of the Annex to Council Decision 91/314/EEC of 26 June 1991 setting up a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary Islands (Poseican) (2) states that specific tariff measures must continue to be considered and that in principle they must be limited to the transitional period provided for under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 for the gradual adoption of the CCT to the Canary Islands;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 of 15 June 1992 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands (3) suspended in full until 31 December 1995 CCT duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the products listed in the Annex to the Regulation which are intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1605/95, the Commission has examined this year the effect of measures adopted in favour of the economy of the Canary Islands; whereas that examination has shown that the suspension of duties on certain industrial products has not had the effect of increasing the volume of imports originating in non-Community countries;\nWhereas the progressive introduction of the suspended CCT duties will not in principle have any adverse effect on the sectors concerned by the duty suspensions or, in general, on the Canary Islands' economy as a whole; whereas an appropriate timetable should be laid down for successive increases in the applicable rates of duty;\nWhereas, in order to take advantage of the closing date of the transitional period laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 and to take account of the request from the Spanish authorities, the duty suspensions under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 may be retained in 1996;\nWhereas, in view of the foregoing, the progressive introduction of CCT duties must commence on 1 January 1997 until fully applicable on 31 December 2000; whereas, in the case of certain sensitive sectors of the Canary Islands' economy, in particular those processing imported raw materials into finished products and commerce, duties should be introduced in a flexible manner so as to prevent in the early years any adverse effect on production and employment in those sectors;\nWhereas the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, approved by the Community by Decision 94/800/EC (4) provides for bound tariff reductions to be implemented in five equal rate reductions (or 10 rate reductions for certain tariff headings); whereas that progressive reduction, which became operative in 1995, will culminate in a minimum, or even a zero, rate by the end of the period in question; whereas, consequently, duty suspensions should continue in respect of certain industrial products on which CCT duties resulting from the GATT agreements would reach a zero or minimum rate on 31 December 2000, the date on which the transitional period for the Canary Islands expires;\nWhereas imports into the Canary Islands of certain goods originating in non-Community countries were non-existent or nearly so during the period in which CCT duty suspensions applied; whereas, consequently, there are no grounds for retaining those suspensions;\nWhereas the measures taken under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 should be retained, on the one hand, in order to ensure that products on which the suspension of duty is extended and then progressively dismantled are intended solely for the Canary Islands' domestic market and, on the other hand, in order to permit the Commission to be regularly informed of the volume of the imports in question and, if necessary, to adopt provisions designed to prevent any speculative movement of deflection of trade,", "main_body": ["1.
