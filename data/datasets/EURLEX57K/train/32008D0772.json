Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and primary products of animal origin covered by that Directive, are subject to the submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances listed in that Annex.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29\u00a0April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\u00a0(2) approves the residue monitoring plans submitted by certain third countries listed in the Annex to that Decision for the animals and primary products indicated in that list.\n(3) As regards the entry for South Africa, imports of wild and farmed game meat, other than ostriches, were deleted from the list of authorised imports set out in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC, as amended by Commission Decision 2008/407/EC\u00a0(3), as South Africa failed to provide evidence of the implementation of the plan for wild and farmed game, other than ostriches. In particular, sampling was being performed, but laboratory analyses have not been carried out.\n(4) A Commission inspection to South Africa carried out from 2 to 7 July 2008 revealed that the 2007 to 2008 residues monitoring plan for both wild and farmed game has been implemented in that third country and that sampling in accordance with the residues monitoring plan for 2007 to 2008 was completed and the sampling in accordance with the residues monitoring plan for 2008 to 2009 is underway. Therefore, as the approved plans covering the years 2006 to 2007, 2007 to 2008 were implemented and as the laboratory analyses results were adequate, the overall situation regarding residue controls in farmed and wild game is satisfactory. On that basis, it is appropriate to amend the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC so that imports are authorised into the Community from South Africa of wild and farmed game, including ostriches, as provided for in the approved plans.\n(5) Israel has submitted a residue monitoring plan to the Commission for farmed game. The evaluation of that plan and the additional information obtained by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees, on the residue monitoring plan in respect of farmed game. That product should therefore be included in the entry for Israel in the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC.\n(6) China has submitted a residue monitoring plan to the Commission for eggs. The evaluation of this plan and the additional information obtained by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees, on the residue monitoring plan in respect of eggs. That product should therefore be included in the entry for China in the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC.\n(7) Ukraine has submitted a residue monitoring plan to the Commission for poultry, equidae and aquaculture. The evaluation of that plan and the additional information obtained by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees, on the residue monitoring plan in respect for those products. They should therefore be included in the entry for Ukraine in the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC.\n(8) Some mistakes concerning the numbering of certain footnotes in the Annex to Decision 2008/407/EC should be corrected.\n(9) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 30 September 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 154, 30.4.2004, p. 44, as corrected by OJ L 189, 27.5.2004, p. 33.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 143, 3.6.2008, p. 49.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nCode ISO2 Country Bovine Ovine/caprine Swine Equine Poultry Aquaculture Milk Eggs Rabbit Wild game Farmed game Honey\nAD Andorra\u00a0(1) X X  X\nAE United Arab Emirates      X\nAL Albania  X    X  X\nAN Netherlands Antilles       X\u00a0(2)\nAR Argentina X X  X X X X X X X X X\nAU Australia X X  X  X X   X X X\nBA Bosnia and Herzegovina      X\nBD Bangladesh      X\nBR Brazil X   X X X      X\nBW Botswana X          X\nBY Belarus    X\u00a0(3)  X X X\nBZ Belize      X\nCA Canada X X X X X X X X X X X X\nCH Switzerland X X X X X X X X X X X X\nCL Chile X X\u00a0(4) X  X X X   X  X\nCN China     X X  X X   X\nCO Colombia      X\nCR Costa Rica      X\nCU Cuba      X      X\nEC Ecuador      X\nET Ethiopia            X\nFK Falkland Islands X X\nFO Faeroe Islands      X\nGL Greenland  X        X X\nGM Gambia      X\nGT Guatemala      X      X\nHK Hong Kong     X\u00a0(5) X\u00a0(5)\nHN Honduras      X\nHR Croatia X X X X\u00a0(6) X X X X X X X X\nID Indonesia      X\nIL Israel     X X X X   X X\nIN India      X X X    X\nIS Iceland X X X X  X X    X\u00a0(5)\nIR Iran      X\nJM Jamaica      X      X\nJP Japan      X\nKG Kyrgyzstan            X\nKR South Korea      X\nLK Sri Lanka      X\nMA Morocco      X\nME Montenegro\u00a0(5) X X X X\u00a0(6)        X\nMG Madagascar      X\nMK The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u00a0(6) X X  X\u00a0(6)   X\nMU Mauritius     X\u00a0(5) X\nMX Mexico    X  X  X    X\nMY Malaysia     X\u00a0(7) X\nMZ Mozambique      X\nNA Namibia X X        X X\nNC New Caledonia X     X    X X X\nNI Nicaragua      X      X\nNZ New Zealand X X  X  X X   X X X\nPA Panama      X\nPE Peru     X X\nPH Philippines      X\nPN Pitcairn Islands            X\nPY Paraguay X\nRS Serbia\u00a0(8) X X X X\u00a0(6) X X X X  X  X\nRU Russia X X X X\u00a0(6) X  X X   X\u00a0(9) X\nSA Saudi Arabia      X\nSC Seychelles      X\nSG Singapore X\u00a0(5) X\u00a0(5) X\u00a0(5)  X\u00a0(5) X\u00a0(5) X\u00a0(5)\nSM San Marino\u00a0(10) X  X         X\nSR Suriname      X\nSV El Salvador            X\nSZ Swaziland X\nTH Thailand     X X      X\nTN Tunisia     X X    X\nTR Turkey     X X X     X\nTW Taiwan      X      X\nTZ Tanzania      X      X\nUA Ukraine    X X X X X    X\nUG Uganda            X\nUS United States X X X X X X X X X X X X\nUY Uruguay X X  X  X X  X X X X\nVE Venezuela      X\nVN Vietnam      X\nYT Mayotte      X\nZA South Africa          X X\nZM Zambia            X\nZW Zimbabwe      X     X\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Initial residue monitoring plan approved by veterinary sub-group EC-Andorra (in accordance with Decision No 2/1999 of EC-Andorra Joint Committee of 22 December 1999) (OJ L 31, 5.2.2000, p. 84).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Third countries using only raw material from other approved third countries for food production.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Export of live equidae for slaughter (food producing animals only).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Only ovine animals.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Provisional situation pending further information on residues.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; provisional code which does not prejudge in any way the definitive nomenclature for this country, which is currently under discussion at the United Nations.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Peninsular (western) Malaysia only.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0Not including Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0Only for reindeer from the Murmansk and Yamalo-Nenets regions.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring plan approved in accordance with Decision No 1/94 of the EC-San Marino Cooperation Committee of 28 June 1994 (OJ L 238, 13.9.1994, p. 25).\u2019"}
