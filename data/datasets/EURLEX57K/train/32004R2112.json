However, if producer organisations in the new Member States are to inform the competent authorities of their wish to participate in the aid scheme at a later stage, the deadline for the conclusion of short-term contracts that cover at least eight complete and consecutive months should be revised accordingly. Nevertheless, any revision of that deadline should not jeopardise the necessary checks to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 634/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) Since the 2004/2005 marketing year started on 1 October 2004, and contracts between producer organisations and processors have already been arranged, amendments should apply from 10 September 2004.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["In Regulation (EC) No 634/2004 the following Articles 3a and 3b are inserted:\n\u2018Article 3a\nBy way of derogation from Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2003, for the 2004/2005 marketing year, and for the new Member States only, producer organisations wishing to participate in the aid scheme provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 shall inform the competent authorities of the Member State in which their head office is situated no later than 120 days after they have been recognised or provisionally admitted under Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96\u00a0(5), but in any case no later than 21 January 2005.", "b\nBy way of derogation from Article 10(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2003, for the 2004/05 marketing year, and for the new Member States only, short-term contracts that cover at least eight complete and consecutive months shall be concluded no later than 1 February 2005.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 September 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 49.
