GENERAL REMARKS  This programme relates to the whole of the Portuguese fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Portugal.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 205 349 GRT and 530 183 kW, in accordance with point II.2 below;\n(b) to redeploy fishing activities in coastal areas towards more distant and deeper waters;\n(c) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong.\n2. During the period covered by the programme the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\n- vessels used solely for bivalve fishing,\nmust remain within the following limits:\nTonnage  (Tonnage GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\n1.

PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at point II.2, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992, account must also be  taken of changes, if any, in fishing capacity resulting from:\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1991, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs.\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction  achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in point III.12.1 is reduced as planned:\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with new vessels and, where necessary, by the additional withdrawal of entire  units, in line with the guidelines and objectives laid down at point II.2,\n(\u00b9) Overall capacity may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reduction which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programme's objectives.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity.\n4. Redeployment of the capacity represented by vessels used for local or coastal fishing, measuring less than nine metres between perpendiculars and registered on the mainland.\n5. Redeployment of coastal fishing vessels measuring over nine metres between perpendiculars and registered on the mainland, by the withdrawal of obolete or unsuitable vessels and by encouraging the use of more selective fishing techniques.\n6. Redistribution of the fleets registered in the Azores and Madeira to the benefit of units fishing for:\n- sedentary species in Azorean or Madeiran waters,\n- highly migratory species found in waters under Portuguese sovereignty.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved by  Member States (\u00b9) can be taken into account on 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the remaining  maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 1991."}
