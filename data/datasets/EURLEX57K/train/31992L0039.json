Article 3 (4) is replaced by the following:\n'4. As from 1 January 1997, only those monomers and other starting substances listed in Annex II, Section A, shall be used for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles, subject to the restrictions specified therein. However, the substances  listed in Annex II, Section B may be deleted before the abovementioned date if the data requested for inclusion in Section A are not supplied in time to permit their evaluation by the Scientific Committee for Food. Moreover, before 1 January 1996 it may  be decided that, in some justified cases, for certain substances listed in Annex II, Section B, this time-limit will be postponed.'\n2. Annex II of Directive 90/128/EEC is amended as follows:\n(a) Section A:\n- the substances appearing in Annex I to this Directive are added;\n- the content of the column 'Restrictions' for the substances appearing in Annex II of this Directive is modified as indicated therein.\n(b) Section B:\n- the substances appearing in Annex III to this Directive are added, as a replacement for those groups of substances which are not well-defined and which are deleted by this Directive;\n- the substances appearing in Annex IV to this Directive are deleted;\n- the content of the column 'Restrictions' for the substance appearing in Annex V to this Directive is modified as indicated therein.\n(c) The substances appearing in Annex VI to this Directive are transferred from Section B to A and are now subject to the restrictions, if any, specified.\n(d) Point 8 is hereby amended as follows:\n- the following text is inserted after 'NCO = isocyanate moiety;'\n'ND = not detectable.\nFor the purpose of this Directive \"not detectable\" means that the substance should not be detected by a validated method of analysis which should detect it at the detection limit (DL) specified.\nIf such a method does not currently exist, an analytical method with appropriate performance characteristics at the detection limit may be used, pending the development of a validated method.'\n- the following text is inserted after 'SML = specific migration limit in food or in food stimulant, unless it is specified otherwise.'\n'For the purpose of this Directive \"SML\" means that the specific migration of the substance should be determined by a validated method of analysis at the specified limit.
