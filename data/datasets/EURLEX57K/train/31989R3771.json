whereas the natural drying to a moisture content not exceeding 15 % as specified in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89 requires suitable climatic conditions; whereas the production areas should be restricted to those areas having such climatic conditions;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 10a (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, the minimum particulars which must be included in the cultivation contract should be laid down;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89, Member States must introduce the administrative arrangements, including physical inspection, necessary to ensure that the qualifying requirements for the aid are met; whereas, for the purposes of the inspections to be carried out, only one declaration may be submitted per cultivation contract; whereas the crop declaration and contract must include certain minimum particulars;\nWhereas pursuant to Article 2 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (5), the aid is to be converted into national currency at the rate prevailing when the transaction or part of the transaction was carried out;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 specifies that the time when a transaction was carried out is considered as being the date of the event by which the aid becomes due and payable; whereas in the case of flint maize that event is harvest; whereas, in view of the difficulty in determining the exact of harvesting in each case, the date to be taken as the representative date of harvest should be the first day of the marketing year in respect of which the entitlement to aid arises;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3745/89 (7), applies to the security provided for in this Regulation; whereas it is therefore necessary to define the primary requirements incumbent upon manufacturers of swollen or roasted cereal products falling within CN code 1904 10 10;\nWhereas certain rules provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89 should be specified more clearly by defining the minimum items of information to be checked; whereas, on account of the cost and administrative difficulties, a simplified system would be suitable for declarations relating to small areas;\nWhereas provision should be made for measures to discourage declarations which do not correspond to the facts;\nWhereas the list of varieties of the product in question must be adopted taking into account the definition of high-quality flint maize laid down in Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89; whereas the varieties should display the characteristics referred to in the abovementioned Article, particularly as regards kernel type, kernel tip colour and flotation test; whereas the flotation test for determining the percentage by weight of the sample which floats should be described in detail; whereas a procedure should be laid down for including varieties of flint maize on the list;\nWhereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The aid provided for in Article 10a of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 shall be granted for the production of certain varieties of flint maize grown in the areas listed in Annex I to this Regulation, in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation.\nTITLE I\nConditions and terms", "The aid shall be granted:\n1. in respect of areas:\n(a) on which the crop has been left standing in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89;\n(b) for which a cultivation contract has been concluded, as provided for in the first indent of Article 10a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, with a manufacturer of products falling within CN code 1904 10 10, hereinafter referred to as the manufacturer, in accordance with Article 3 of this Regulation;

The Member State in which the declaration is submitted shall pay the aid not later than the third month following the date on which the sales invoice for the flint maize and proof of the lodging of the security referred to in Article 2 are received.\nIn cases where the producer was able to deliver only part of the quantities covered by the cultivation contract, for reasons not due to serious negligence on his part, the aid shall be granted in proportion to the quantities delivered and calculated on the basis of the average yields for the region.\n2. The operative event within the meaning of Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 as regards entitlement to the aid shall be regarded as occuring on 1 July of the year in which the flint maize is produced. Article 6\n1.

At the request of the interested party, the Member State may release the security by instalments in proportion to the quantities in respect of which the evidence referred to in paragraph 1 has been produced and provided that evidence has been produced that a quantity equal to at least 5 % of the quantity indicated in the sales invoice has been processed.", "Where maize harvested in the Community is the subject of intra-Community trade for processing in a Member State other than the producer Member State, the maize shall be dispatched under customs control.
