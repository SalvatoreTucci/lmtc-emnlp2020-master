The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.\n(5) There is a technological need for the use of Advantame as a high-intensity sweetener in various food and tabletop products in order to replace caloric sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, etc.) thus allowing for a reduction of the caloric content of those foodstuffs. The addition of Advantame as a sweetener to the categories of foods in which high-intensity sweeteners are authorised according to Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 will provide manufacturers with greater flexibility in formulating energy-reduced foods with a similar taste profile as the full-caloric equivalent. The flavour and sweetness qualities of Advantame, coupled with good stability characteristics, mean that Advantame provides an alternative to already approved high-intensity sweeteners, offering consumers and the food industry the option to choose from a wider selection of sweeteners, thus reducing the intake of each individual sweetener.\n(6) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) evaluated the safety of Advantame when used as a food additive and expressed its opinion on 31 July 2013\u00a0(4). The Authority established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for Advantame of 5 mg/kg bw/day. Conservative estimates of advantame exposure for high level adults and children consumers were below the ADI for the proposed use levels. After considering all the data on stability, degradation products, toxicology and exposure, the Authority concluded that Advantame would not be of safety concern at the proposed uses and use levels as a sweetener.\n(7) Therefore, it is appropriate to authorise the use of Advantame as a sweetener in the food categories specified in Annex I to this Regulation and to assign E 969 as an E-number to that food additive.\n(8) The specifications for Advantame should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union list of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.\n(9) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a083, 22.3.2012, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;

In the final step, the HMPA methanol solution (filtrate) is combined with aspartame to give the imine that under selective hydrogenation forms advantame. The solution is allowed to crystallise and crude crystals are washed. The product is re-crystallised and crystals are separated, washed and dried.\nCAS No. 714229-20-6\nChemical name N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) propyl]-\u03b1-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, monohydrate (IUPAC);\nMolecular formula C24H30N2O7\u0387H2O\nMolecular weight 476,52\u00a0g/mol (monohydrate)\nAssay Not less than 97,0 % and not more than 102,0 % on an anhydrous basis\nDescription White to yellow powder\nIdentification\nMelting Point 101,5\u00a0\u00b0C\nPurity\nN-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl-\u03b1-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine (ANS9801-acid) Not more than 1,0 %\nTotal other related substances Not more than 1,5 %\nResidual Solvents Isopropyl acetate: Not more than 2\u00a0000 mg/kg\nWater content Not more than 5,0 % (Karl Fischer method)\nResidue on ignition Not more than 0,2 %\nArsenic Not more than 2 mg/kg\nLead Not more than 1 mg/kg\nPalladium Not more than 5,3\u00a0mg/kg\nPlatinum Not more than 1,7\u00a0mg/kg\u2019"}
