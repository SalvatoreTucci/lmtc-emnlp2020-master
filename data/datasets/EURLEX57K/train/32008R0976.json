Commission Regulations (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3), (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(4) and (EC) No 162/2003\u00a0(5) authorised that additive for 10 years for use for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and chickens reared for laying respectively, linking the authorisation to the person responsible for putting that additive into circulation. That additive was notified as an existing product in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Since all the information required under that provision was submitted, that additive was entered into the Community Register of Feed Additives.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the holder of the authorisation and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority). The holder of the authorisation of the additive diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5\u00a0% Premix) has submitted an application with which it proposes changing the conditions of the authorisation by introducing a maximum residue limit (MRL) as evaluated by the Authority. At the same time it provided the necessary data to support that request.\n(3) In its opinion adopted on 16 April 2008\u00a0(6), the Authority concluded that no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys for fattening. However, in case MRLs were considered necessary, it suggested values. Because it is possible that the chickens reared for laying enter in the food chain, not separately from the other chickens, it is necessary to consider the possibility to provide MRLs also for that animal category. It also considered that applying a withdrawal period of zero days would not compromise consumer safety.\n(4) To ensure a high level of safety for the consumers and to improve the controls of the correct use of diclazuril, it is appropriate to establish MRLs as proposed by the Authority. Because there are no relevant physiological differences between the chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying it is appropriate to establish the same MRLs also for the latter category.\n(5) Commission Regulations (EC) No 2430/1999, (EC) No 418/2001 and (EC) No 162/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 the line for E 771 is replaced by the text in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 418/2001 is replaced by the text in Annex II to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 162/2003 is replaced by the text in Annex III to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 62, 2.3.2001, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 26, 31.1.2003, p. 3.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Updated Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the Maximum Residue Limits for Clinacox 0,5\u00a0% (diclazuril) for turkeys for fattening, chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying.
