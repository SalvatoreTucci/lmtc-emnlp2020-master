It is the Commission's responsibility to monitor and review its application.\n(3) Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC\u00a0(2) provides for detailed rules on the internal electricity market. These rules aim, inter alia, at the further developing cross-border interconnections and ensuring a high standard of security of electricity supply.\n(4) Directive 2009/72/EC entrusts regulatory authorities with the task to monitor compliance with network security and reliability rules and investments in generation capacity in relation to security of supply. In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 713/2009\u00a0(3), the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators shall assist the regulatory authorities, where necessary coordinate their action and monitor the execution of the tasks of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (\u2018ENTSO-E\u2019).\n(5) Directive 2009/72/EC furthermore provides that transmission system operators shall be responsible for ensuring a secure, reliable and efficient electricity system, while Regulation (EC) No 714/2009\u00a0(4) entrusts ENTSO-E with the task to adopt tools to ensure coordination of network operation in normal and emergency conditions and to produce regularly a European generation adequacy outlook.\n(6) Under Directive 2009/72/EC Member States, as well as the regulatory authorities, are obliged to cooperate with each other and with the Commission for the purpose of integrating their national markets, as a first step towards the creation of a fully liberalised internal market. The Commission monitors the implementation of the provisions of Directive 2009/72/EC\u00a0(5).\n(7) The increasing production of electricity from renewable energy sources leads to new challenges for the internal electricity market, notably with respect to grid stability and security of electricity supply. Increased coordination of policy measures related to the internal electricity market between Member States, other involved stakeholders and the Commission is crucial for the success of the integration of European electricity markets and the maintenance of a high standard of security of electric supply.\n(8) The Commission has therefore launched several meetings of high-level representatives from competent Member State authorities, national energy regulators, ENTSO-E and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\u2018the Agency\u2019) to exchange views and feed into its policy thinking on electricity security of supply matters, including grid stability and generation adequacy. These first activities and the idea of an Electricity Coordination Group were discussed at the informal Energy Council in Wroclaw in September 2011 and in the meetings of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council in November 2011 and February 2012 meeting.\n(9) These meetings of high level representatives have proven to be very useful for the Commission and all involved stakeholders. They provided valuable insights into internal electricity market and security of supply issues and allowed to discuss different possible solutions to address the existing problems. They highlighted in particular the need to address the new challenges relating to integrated electricity markets on a European level.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to formalise this group of experts in the field of electricity and to define its tasks and its structure.\n(11) The group should help to strengthen and intensify the cooperation and coordination between Member States and the Commission in the field of cross-border trade of electricity and security of supply issues, including generation adequacy and grid stability, and also to prepare potential new policy initiatives and react to potential supply crises.\n(12) The Electricity Coordination Group should provide the Commission and its members with the necessary policy expertise for initiatives aimed at preserving and enhancing market integration and security of electricity supply.\n(13) The Group should be composed of the Member States' competent authorities (ministry competent for electricity and national regulatory authority), of ENTSO-E and of the Agency. Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be laid down.\n(14) Personal data relating to the members of the Group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(6),", "main_body": ["Establishment of the Electricity Coordination Group\nThe Electricity Coordination Group, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Group\u2019, is hereby set up.", "Tasks of the Group\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Group's tasks shall be:\n(a) to serve as a platform for the exchange of information and coordination of electricity policy measures having a cross-border impact and for the exchange of experiences, best practices and expertise and also to assist the Commission in designing its policy initiatives;\n(b) to facilitate the exchange of information and cooperation regarding security of supply in electricity, including generation adequacy and cross-border grid stability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Group shall in particular:\n(a) exchange information on decisions regarding generation and transmission and their potential consequences for cross-border trade and grid stability cross-borders;\n(b) discuss specific issues raising concerns on grid stability and/or generation adequacy with a view to come to co-ordinated solutions in line with the internal energy market;\n(c) review the regular adequacy outlooks prepared by ENTSO-E, in particular where such reports indicate a potential risk to security of supply;\n(d) promote the exchange of information, prevention and coordinated action in case of an emergency within the Union and with third countries.", "Consultation\nThe Commission may consult the Group on any matter relating to electricity and, in particular, security of electricity supply.", "Composition of the Group\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Group shall be composed of the following members:\n(a) Member States' authorities, in particular Ministries competent for energy;\n(b) the National Regulatory Authorities for energy;\n(c) the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\u2018the Agency\u2019) established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009\u00a0(7);\n(d) the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (\u2018The ENTSO for Electricity\u2019) established by Regulation (EC) No 714/2009\u00a0(8).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each of the members shall nominate not more than two permanent representatives and two alternates to participate in the work of the Group.
