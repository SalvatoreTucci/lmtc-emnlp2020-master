To reflect amendments in CN codes for dairy products, it is necessary to update Annexes I, II and VIIa to that Regulation.\n(3) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 refers to CN codes which are deleted with effect from 1 January 2015. Moreover, Annex 3, relating to concessions regarding cheeses, to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(4), approved by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of the Council and of the Commission\u00a0(5), provides for the full liberalisation of the bilateral trade in cheeses as from 2007. That provision is therefore obsolete and should be deleted.\n(4) Article 19a(1)(c) and (4)(c) relating to Part 3 of Annex VIIa to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 and Article 20(1)(a)(ii) relating to Part C of Annex II to that Regulation concern respectively a cheese tariff quota and preferential imports in application of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part\u00a0(6), approved by Council Decision 2004/441/EC\u00a0(7). Those provisions refer to CN codes which are deleted with effect from 1\u00a0January 2015. Since the corresponding quota period and import duty elimination period have expired, it is appropriate to delete those provisions.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation
