Mekra, Niederrheinischer Rotklee Remy, Oberhaunst\u00e4dter Violettsamiger, Odenwalder Rotklee, Ostsaat-Traun, Titus 71 (purple clover) and the relevant varieties of white mustard have been the subject in the Republic of France of an application for official acceptance in so far as their seed, as regards the varieties of grasses, is not intended for the production of fodder plants (Article 4 (2) (a) of the said Directive) in so far as their seed is to be marketed in another country (Article 4 (2) (b) thereof) ; whereas therefore even the applicant has not claimed that these varieties have any satisfactory value for cultivation or use in the Republic of France ; whereas therefore these varieties can be treated as not producing results in the Republic of France which with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, thereof);\nWhereas the species of red fescue has not yet been put to agricultural use in the Republic of France ; whereas the varieties concerned of lucerne and purple clover other than those mentioned above are local varieties originating in another Member State ; whereas the varieties of rice concerned are very early ; whereas the varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index of 700 or over or are of the sterile male type ; whereas it is well known that the varieties of red fescue considered as fodder plants, the local varieties of lucerne and purple clover originating in another country, the very early varieties of rice and the varieties of maize having an FAO maturity class index of 700 or over or of the sterile male type at present are not yet suitable for cultivation in the Republic of France (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, thereof);\nWhereas the other varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official growing trials in the  (1)OJ No L 225, 12.10.1970, p. 1. (2)OJ No L 356, 27.12.1973, p. 79. (3)OJ No L 32, 5.2.1975, p. 34.\nRepublic of France ; whereas the results of these trials have led the Republic of France to decide that these varieties are not sufficiently uniform there or that their value for cultivation or use is inferior to other comparable varieties accepted in the Republic of France;\nWhereas the other Member States have accepted these results for the varieties, Dactimo (cocksfoot), Garanta (meadow fescue), Westerwolds Raaigras Landras (Westerwold ryegrass), Lofar (timothy grass), Weiristenta (purple clover), Fries Groninger, von Kamekes (white clover), Minor (field bean), Jufy I (common wheat), Gineke (potatoes) ; whereas it is therefore clear that these varieties do not produce results in the Republic of France, which, with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to these obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, thereof);\nWhereas for the varieties Wendelmoed (meadow fescue), Heidemij (timothy grass), Akela (rape), Delphin (oats), Zephyr (two-row barley), Dura, Hauters Wintergerste, M\u00e4dru Perga, Tocka (winter barley), Caribo (common wheat), the results of the trials show that in the Republic of France, when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there which apply within the framework of current Community provisions, they are not sufficiently uniform in certain characteristics (Article 15 (3) (a) thereof);\nWhereas in respect of the other varieties listed in Article 1 of this Decision, the results of the trials show that they do not produce results in the Republic of France, which with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, thereof);\nWhereas the application of the Republic of France in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full;\nWhereas account should also be taken of the fact that some of these varieties are officially accepted in the Republic of France provided their seed is not intended for the production of fodder plants or is to be marketed in another country;\nWhereas for the following varieties, Dagoma, Iris, Luna Roskilde, N.F.G., Unke Pajbjerg (cocksfoot), Combi (perennial rye-grass), Eskimo (timothy grass), Argentina (oats) and Montanari Viscardo (durum wheat), the Republic of France is not yet in a position for reasons in part beyond its control to justify its application:\nWhereas therefore the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive should be extended in the case of the Republic of France by an appropriate period to enable her to prepare the necessary data concerning these varieties (Article 15 (7));\nWhereas with respect to the following varieties, Dorise, Lemba, R.v.P., Mullus Pajbjerg (cocksfoot), Bergamo, Fiola (meadow fescue), Eclata, Molto, N.F.G., (Westerwald rye-grass), L 17 Asso, Lemtal R.v.P. (Italian rye-grass), Semperweide (perennial rye-grass), Jacoba, Landsberger (timothy grass), Diplomat (common wheat), the conditions for authorization do not appear to be satisfied;\nWhereas other varieties are no longer included in the French application;\nWhereas the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1.
