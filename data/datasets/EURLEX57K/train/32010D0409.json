They should provide tools for assessment of the safety level and the performance of the operators at EU level as well as in Member States.\n(2) Article 3(e) of Directive 2004/49/EC defines CSTs as the safety levels that must at least be reached by different parts of the railway system (such as the conventional railway system, the high speed railway system, long railway tunnels or lines solely used for freight transport) and by the system as a whole, expressed in risk acceptance criteria. However, Recital 7 of Commission Decision 2009/460/EC of 5 June 2009 on the adoption of a common safety method for assessment of achievement of safety targets, as referred to in Article 6 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) states that, due to the lack of harmonised and reliable data on safety performance of parts of rail systems which are in operation in the different Member States, the development of the first set of CSTs for parts of the rail system (such as the conventional rail system, the high speed rail system, long railway tunnels or lines solely used for freight transport) is not feasible.\n(3) Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/49/EC requires that the first set of CSTs should be based on an examination of existing targets and safety performance of railway systems in the Member States. According to the methodology established by Decision 2009/460/EC, the first set of CSTs is to be based on National Reference Values (NRVs). It has been calculated using series of data based on Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics\u00a0(3) and provided by Eurostat on 6 March 2009 for the period 2004-2007. For each railway risk category the maximum tolerable level of risk for a Member State should be (1) the NRV if the NRV is equal to, or lower than, the corresponding CST or (2) the CST if the NRV is higher than the corresponding CST, in accordance with section 3 of the annex to Decision 2009/460/EC.\n(4) The first set of CSTs should be considered as a first step of a process. With this first set, a harmonised and transparent framework is put in place for an efficient monitoring and safeguarding the European safety performance of railways.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 27(1) of the Directive 2004/49/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and definitions\nThis Decision establishes
