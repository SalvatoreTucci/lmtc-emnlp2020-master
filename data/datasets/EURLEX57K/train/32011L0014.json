Commission Decision 1999/43/EC\u00a0(2) confirmed that the dossier was \u2018complete\u2019 in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(2) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 28 March 2001.\n(3) For profoxydim the draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 23 November 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for profoxydim.\n(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing profoxydim may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include profoxydim in Annex I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(5) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing provisional authorisations of plant protection products containing profoxydim to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should transform existing provisional authorisations into full authorisations, amend them or withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 January 2012 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

On the basis of that evaluation, they shall determine whether the product satisfies the conditions set out in Article 4(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\nFollowing that determination Member States shall:\n(a) in the case of a product containing profoxydim as the only active substance, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 31 January 2013 at the latest; or\n(b) in the case of a product containing profoxydim as one of several active substances, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 31 January 2013 or by the date fixed for such an amendment or withdrawal in the respective directive or directives which added the relevant substance or substances to Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, whichever is the latest.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 1 August 2011.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 14, 19.1.1999, p. 30.\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the following entry is added at the end of the table:\nNo Common Name, Identification Numbers IUPAC Name Purity\u00a0(1) Entry into force Expiration of inclusion Specific provisions\n\u2018330 Profoxydim 2 \u2013 [(1 E/Z) \u2013 [(2 R S) \u2013 2 \u2013 (4 \u2013 chlorophenoxy) propoxyimino] butyl] \u2013 3 \u2013 hydroxy \u2013 5 \u2013 [(3 R S; 3 S R) \u2013 tetrahydro \u2013 2 H \u2013 thiopyran \u2013 3 \u2013 yl] cyclohex \u2013 2 \u2013 enone \u2265 940\u00a0g/kg 1 August 2011 31 July 2021 PART A\n\u2014 the protection of groundwater when the active substance is applied in regions with vulnerable soil and/or climatic conditions,\n\u2014 the long term risk to non-target organisms.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Further details on identity and specification of active substances are provided in the review report."}
