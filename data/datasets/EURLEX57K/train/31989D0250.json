whereas Article 15 of that Regulation permits transitional financing, as from 1 January 1989, of certain operations involving regions not covered by the said objectives; whereas therefore, the indicative allocation of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF to be fixed pursuant to Article 12 (6) of that Regulation does not concern those appropriations relating to the two categories of operations referred to above,", "main_body": ["The indicative allocation between Member States to be established pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 12 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88, in so far as resources to be devoted to Objective 1 as defined by that Regulation are concerned, is given in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 January 1989.\nFor the Commission\nBruce MILLAN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 185, 18. 7. 1988, p. 9.\n(2) OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1988, p. 15.\nANNEX\nIndicative percentage allocation between Member States covering 85 % of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF to be devoted to Objective 1\n1989-1993\n1.2 //  //  // Member State  // Indicative allocation Objective 1   //    //   // Belgium   // -   // Denmark   // -  // Federal Republic of Germany   // -   // Greece   // 16,2  // Spain   // 32,6   // France   // 2,1   // Ireland   // 5,4  // Italy   // 24,5   // Luxembourg   // -   // Netherlands  // -   // Portugal   // 17,5   // United Kingdom   // 1,7  //    //   // Total  // 100,0   //    //"}
