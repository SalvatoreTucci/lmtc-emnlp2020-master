Therefore, provision should be made for recourse to such storage in respect of a quantity corresponding to the difference between summer and winter production.\n(3) The detailed rules of this measure should determine the maximum quantity to benefit from it as well as the duration of the contracts in relation to the real requirements of the market and the keeping qualities of the cheeses in question. It is necessary to specify the terms of the storage contract so as to enable the identification of the cheese and to maintain checks on the stock in respect of which aid is granted. The aid should be fixed taking into account storage costs and the foreseeable trend of market prices.\n(4) In view of experience in controls, the provisions relating thereto should be specified, in particular as regards the documents to be presented and the on-the-spot checks to be conducted. These requirements on the subject make it necessary to stipulate that the Member States may provide that the costs of controls be fully or in part charged to the contractor.\n(5) Article 1(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 of 30 June 1993 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 569/1999(3), fixes the conversion rate to be applied in the framework of private storage aid schemes in the milk products sector.\n(6) It is appropriate to guarantee the continuation of the storage operations in question.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Aid shall be granted in respect of the private storage of 23000 tonnes of long-keeping (Emmental and Gruy\u00e8re) cheeses manufactured in the Community which satisfy the requirements of Articles 2 and 3 hereof.", "1.
