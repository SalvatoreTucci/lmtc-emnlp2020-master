The Member States\u2019 specialised national services, the judicial authorities and relevant bodies of the European Union such as Europol and Eurojust absolutely need information if they are to perform their tasks.\n(4) Council Decision 2003/48/JHA of 19 December 2002 on the implementation of specific measures for police and judicial cooperation to combat terrorism in accordance with Article 4 of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP\u00a0(2) is a major step forward. The persistence of the terrorist threat and the complexity of the phenomenon raise the need for ever greater exchanges of information. The scope of information exchanges must be extended to all stages of criminal proceedings, including convictions, and to all persons, groups or entities investigated, prosecuted or convicted for terrorist offences.\n(5) Since the objectives of this decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore, given the need for reciprocity, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(6) In the execution of the exchange of information, this Decision is without prejudice to essential national security interests, and it should not jeopardise the safety of individuals or the success of a current investigation or specific intelligence activities in the field of State security.\n(7) This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018terrorist offences\u2019: the offences specified in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism\u00a0(3);\n(b) \u2018Europol Convention\u2019: the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the establishment of a European Police Office\u00a0(4);\n(c) \u2018Eurojust Decision\u2019: Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime\u00a0(5);\n(d) \u2018group or entity\u2019: \u2018terrorist groups\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and the groups and entities listed in the Annex to Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism\u00a0(6).", "Provision of information concerning terrorist offences to Eurojust, Europol and the Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall designate a specialised service within its police services or other law enforcement authorities, which, in accordance with national law, will have access to and collect all relevant information concerning and resulting from criminal investigations conducted by its law enforcement authorities with respect to terrorist offences and send it to Europol in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall designate one, or where its legal system so provides more than one authority, as Eurojust national correspondent for terrorism matters or an appropriate judicial or other competent authority which, in accordance with national law, shall have access to and can collect all relevant information concerning prosecutions and convictions for terrorist offences and send it to Eurojust in accordance with paragraph 5.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that at least the information referred to in paragraph 4 concerning criminal investigations and the information referred to in paragraph 5 concerning prosecutions and convictions for terrorist offences which affect or may affect two or more Member States, gathered by the relevant authority, is transmitted to:\n(a) Europol, in accordance with national law and with the provisions of the Europol Convention, for processing;
