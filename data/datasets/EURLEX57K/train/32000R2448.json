It is in the Community's interest to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume. In order not to jeopardise the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market.\n(2) It is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up.\n(3) The decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community. To ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.\n(5) Examination of the situation as regards supplies of tropical shrimps and prawns from South and Central America (shrimp and prawns of the genus Penaeus, except the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus japonicus) to the Community market has shown that, mainly due to the \"white spot syndrome\" affecting the species, the user industries are temporarily no longer receiving sufficient supplies. An autonomous tariff quota for a limited quantity and of limited duration should therefore be opened,", "main_body": ["1.
