Point 1 of Annex II lists, amongst others, \u2018kamut\u2019 and \u2018spelt\u2019. However, \u2018kamut\u2019 is a registered trademark of a type of wheat, known as \u2018khorasan wheat\u2019 and spelt is also a type of wheat. \u2018Khorasan wheat\u2019 and \u2018spelt\u2019 should therefore be indicated as types of wheat in point 1 of that Annex.\n(2) Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 establishes the list of foods for which the labelling must include one or more additional particulars. Point 5.1 of that Annex provides that the labelling of foods or food ingredients with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols or phytostanol esters must contain, inter alia, a statement that the food is intended exclusively for people who want to lower their blood cholesterol level.\n(3) That statement, in combination with the health claims authorised for those foods or food ingredients, could potentially lead consumers who do not need to control their blood cholesterol level to use the product and should therefore be amended. Such amendment should reflect the wording of the statement currently provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 608/2004\u00a0(2). That Regulation will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 as from 13 December 2014.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The introductory sentence in point 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.
