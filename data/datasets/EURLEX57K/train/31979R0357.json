(2)OJ No C 296, 11.12.1978, p. 58. (3)OJ No 30, 20.4.1962, p. 989/62. (4)OJ No 48, 19.3.1964, p. 753/64. (5)OJ No L 163, 24.6.1976, p. 13.\nWhereas consideration should also be given to statistics resulting from the application of other Community provisions laying down measures for reorganizing Community wine production;\nWhereas, since sample survey methods can produce accurate results at moderate cost over large areas under vines, Member States should be allowed to conduct the surveys either exhaustively or by sample, provided that standards of statistical reliability are laid down;\nWhereas, in order to be able to assess the production of wine in the Community, information is required each year on yields per hectare and on the mean natural alcoholic strength of fresh grapes, of grape must and of wine ; whereas, in view of the existence of areas with widely differing yields, the area under vines of wine grape varieties should be subdivided into yield classes;\nWhereas the Commission must submit reports in order to enable the Council to examine the extent to which the surveys carried out and the information communicated can help achieve the objectives of this Regulation ; whereas, where appropriate, it must propose the harmonization of the methods used;\nWhereas Member States and the Commission must cooperate as fully as possible when applying this Regulation ; whereas the implementing rules must be laid down after consultation with the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics, set up by Decision 72/279/EEC (1);\nWhereas the procedure to be followed by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics must be laid down;\nWhereas statistical surveys allow production potential to be adjusted to market demand in good time ; whereas such adjustment can considerably reduce the ever-increasing costs of managing the wine market ; whereas the Community should therefore be made financially responsible with regard to the expenses incurred by the Member States concerned in connection with the first basic survey under this Regulation;\nWhereas the establishment of the survey system under this Regulation requires the consequent amendment of certain Community provisions in the wine sector,", "main_body": ["1.
