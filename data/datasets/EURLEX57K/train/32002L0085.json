It has also contributed to environmental protection.\n(3) Council Directive 92/6/EEC(4) provides that, depending on technical possibilities and experiences in Member States, the requirements on installation and use of speed limitation devices could subsequently be extended to light goods vehicles.\n(4) The extension of the scope of Directive 92/6/EEC to vehicles of more than 3,5 tonnes designed for transporting goods or passengers was one of the measures advocated by the Council in its resolution of 26 June 2000 on the improvement of road safety(5), in accordance with the Commission communication of 20 March 2000 on priorities in EU road safety.\n(5) The scope of Directive 92/6/EEC should be extended to motor vehicles of category M2, to vehicles of category M3 having a maximum mass of more than 5 tonnes but not exceeding 10 tonnes and to vehicles of category N2.\n(6) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the introduction of modifications to the Community-wide arrangements for the installation and use of speed limitation devices on certain heavy vehicle categories, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(7) Directive 92/6/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 92/6/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
