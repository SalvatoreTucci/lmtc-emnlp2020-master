It has led to a significant reduction in air traffic over the winter 2008/2009 scheduling period. The summer 2009 scheduling period will also be affected by that economic crisis.\n(2) In order to ensure that the non-utilisation of slots allocated for the summer 2009 scheduling period does not cause air carriers to lose their entitlement to those slots, it is necessary to specify clearly and unambiguously that that scheduling period is affected by the economic crisis.\n(3) The Commission should continue to analyse the impact of the economic crisis on the air transport sector. Should the economic situation continue to deteriorate prior to the winter 2009/2010 scheduling period, the Commission could make a proposal to renew the arrangements contained in this Regulation for the winter 2010/2011 scheduling period. Such a proposal should be preceded by a full impact assessment analysing its possible effects on competition and consumers and should be made only if it forms part of a proposal for a general revision of Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a095/93 of 18\u00a0January 1993 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports\u00a0(3) in order to resolve current slot allocation inefficiencies and to ensure the optimal use of scarce capacity at congested airports.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No\u00a095/93 should therefore be amended accordingly, and as a matter of urgency. This amendment in no way affects the Commission\u2019s powers as regards the application of Articles\u00a081 and\u00a082 of the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No\u00a095/93 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
