This new scheme introduced a stricter co-responsibility mechanism than before. This gave rise to serious problems in applying the scheme, the detailed implementing rules of which are laid down in Commission Regulations (EC) No 1591/2001(2) and (EC) No 1398/2002(3).\n(2) The implementation of the new scheme for cotton harvested in 2001, for which yields per hectare were extremely high, has meant that the total cotton production levels for the 2001/2002 marketing year are very high, which has brought about a sharp cut in the compensation paid pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001.\n(3) The Greek authorities excluded 206365 tonnes of unginned cotton from the quantity eligible for aid for the period 2001/2002. However, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1398/2002 set the quantity of unginned cotton at 1246839 tonnes. Hence, application of the stabiliser mechanism resulted in a reduction of Community aid.\n(4) This reduction in aid consequently affected the incomes of 93405 farmers. Many of these farmers had made considerable investments to meet the environmental requirements and observe good agricultural practice. The loss of income jeopardises the viability of many cotton farms in Greece and could have a very negative social impact in the regions concerned.\n(5) In order to offset the reduction in income of the families affected by the application of the stabiliser mechanism, the Greek Government has envisaged granting aid to those cotton producers who have complied with good agricultural practice to meet the environmental requirements. The maximum amount of the aid concerned will not exceed EUR 90000000.\n(6) Exceptional circumstances exist, making it possible to consider, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation of imbalance recorded, such aid to be compatible with the common market, on the terms specified in this Decision,", "main_body": ["Exceptional aid by the Greek Government in the form of payment for the 2001/2002 marketing year to cotton growers in Greece who have observed good agricultural practices of national compensation totalling not more than EUR 90000000 for the quantities produced recognised by the Commission as eligible for aid under Regulation (EC) No 1398/2002 shall be considered compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
