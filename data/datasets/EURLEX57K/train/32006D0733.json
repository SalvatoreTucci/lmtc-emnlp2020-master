It only limits the consequences of a fall and requires deliberate action on the part of the operator to use personal protective equipment (PPE).\n(6) Fall arresters have several major disadvantages. First, they put constraint on the operator. This may result in operators, and in particular those performing frequent maintenance operations, failing to equip themselves with the PPE before using a fixed ladder. Second, they create secondary hazards in the event of an operator falling and hitting the fixed parts of the machine or installation, if there is not minimum clearance below the operator. Moreover, this unobstructed area must necessarily be larger than the enclosed area required by a cage. Third, they constitute an organisational constraint for companies (management of PPE, need for compatibility between the PPE and the anchorage system). This constraint can lead to malfunctions, which in turn can lead to accidents.\n(7) In contradiction with essential requirement 1.1.2.(b) of Annex I to Directive 98/37/EC, clauses 4.3.2, 6.2 and 6.3 of standard EN ISO 14122-4:2004 put requirements for integrated protective measures (the cage) on the same level as those suitable only for residual risks (PPE).\n(8) The purpose of a standard such as EN ISO 14122-4:2004 is to deal with an aspect of safety relating to a wide range of machinery, and not with specific cases. If, for a specific type of machinery, essential requirements 1.1.2, 1.5.15 and 1.6.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/37/EC cannot be fully satisfied, a standard for that type of machinery may specify the alternative measures to be taken.\n(9) The reference of standard EN ISO 14122-4:2004 should therefore not be published in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN ISO 14122-4:2004 \u2018Safety of machinery \u2014 Permanent means of access to machinery \u2014 Part 4: Fixed ladders\u2019 shall not be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.
