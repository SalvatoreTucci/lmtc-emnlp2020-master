This application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital), as a feed additive for sows, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 was authorised provisionally for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 666/2003\u00a0(2), provisionally for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003\u00a0(3), provisionally for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(4) and for ten years (Bonvital) for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 538/2007\u00a0(5).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for sows. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2007 that the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(6). It further concluded that this preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation for this additional animal category. According to this opinion, the use of this preparation is efficacious in improving the performance parameters of sows. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for the specific requirements of post market monitoring. This opinion also verified the report on the method of analysis of feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of this preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in this Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
