Pursuant to Decision 2012/735/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion. The Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 March 2013.\n(2) Annex II to the Agreement concerns the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation. For a number of products, Appendix 2A and Appendix 5 to that Annex provide for derogations from the rules of origin set out in that Annex in the framework of annual quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down the conditions for the application of those derogations for imports from Peru.\n(3) The quotas set out in Appendix 2A and Appendix 5 to Annex II to the Agreement should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(4) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of origin to the customs authorities, as provided for in the Agreement.\n(5) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(3), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 927/2012\u00a0(4), contains new CN codes which are different from those referred to in the Agreement. Those new codes should therefore be reflected in Part B of the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since the Agreement takes effect on 1 March 2013, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin in Appendix 2A to Annex II to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Columbia and Peru, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Agreement\u2019), shall apply to the products listed in Part A of the Annex to this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin set out in Appendix 5 to Annex II to the Agreement shall apply to the products listed in Part B of the Annex to this Regulation.", "To benefit from the derogation set out in Article 1, the products listed in the Annex shall be accompanied by a proof of origin as set out in Annex II to the Agreement.", "The quotas listed in the Annex shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Articles 308a to 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 March 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 21.12.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0253, 11.10.1993, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0304, 31.10.2012, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nPeru\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the scope of the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by CN codes as they exist at the time of adoption of this Regulation.
