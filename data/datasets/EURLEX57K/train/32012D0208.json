On 16 January 2012 Kenya submitted additional information to its request. According to the information provided by Kenya, catches of raw originating tuna are unusually low even compared to the normal seasonal variations which has led to a decrease in production of tuna loins. Kenya has pointed out the risk involved due to piracy during the supply of raw tuna. This abnormal situation still makes it impossible for Kenya to comply with the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 during a certain period. A new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2012.\n(3) Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU applied until 31 December 2011. It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the ACP countries to the Union as well as a smooth transition to the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the East African Community on the one part and the European Community and its Member States on the other part (\u2018EAC-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement\u2019). Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU should therefore be extended from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013.\n(4) It would be inappropriate to grant derogations in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota granted to the territory of the East African Community under the EAC-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. The quota amounts for 2012 and 2013 should therefore be set at 2\u00a0000 tonnes of tuna loins yearly.\n(5) In the interest of clarity, it is appropriate to set out explicitly that the only non-originating materials to be used for the manufacture of tuna loins of CN code 1604\u00a014\u00a016 should be tuna of HS Headings 0302 or 0303, in order for the tuna loins to benefit from the derogation.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2011/861/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 6 is replaced by the following:\n(4) The Annex is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2012.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 348, 31.12.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 338, 21.12.2011, p. 61.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Periods Quantities\n09.1667 1604\u00a014\u00a016 Tuna loins 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 2\u00a0000 tonnes\n1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012 2\u00a0000 tonnes\n1.1.2013 to 31.12.2013 2\u00a0000 tonnes\u2019"}
