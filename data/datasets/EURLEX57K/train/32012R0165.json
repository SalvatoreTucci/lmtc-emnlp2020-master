The names of the agglomerations found in the counties were defined accurately under the product specification. The geographical description \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 may be applied to products prepared from material collected within the administrative boundaries of the listed places.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin:\nThe origin of the \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 is established by organoleptic and technical tests, as well as by the implementation of a tracing system.\nThe entire process of producing the \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 must be implemented under strict manufacturing and inspection conditions, with the quality-assurance system extending to inspection of the documented source of gathering, consequently, the journey of the product from gathering to delivery of the finished product is identifiable and verifiable.\nThe Purchasing Standard on the quality rules for wild medicinal plants and their basic materials established by the group sets out the quality standards for gathering:\nMany individual gatherers pick the flowers in the camomile fields during the camomile flower\u2019s short harvesting season of a few weeks. There are purchasing points in the region, where the gatherers hand over the freshly picked plants. The buyers transport the loose raw goods of appropriate quality to processing plants in the region without delay within 4 to 8 hours. The accompanying transport certificate includes a delivery letter and a declaration, on which the transporter states the name of the area where the goods have been gathered.\nProof of purchase is issued upon the quantity and quality acceptance of the raw basic material picked by individual gatherers, indicating the name of the place where the goods were gathered and substantiated by the gatherer\u2019s signature. If the basic material arrives at the processing plant in dried form, a certificate of origin and area of gathering must in any event be requested.\nTo ensure traceability during the drying process the logbook must document the amount and place of gathering of the product, as well as the location of gathering and the purchase points. A production report must be drafted on drying in every case.\nAn average quality sample taken from the batches packaged in 10\u00a0kg cardboard boxes in the course of official sampling represents the quality of the entire batch. If the product meets the requirements of the European Pharmacop\u0153ia and the up-to-date version of the Hungarian Pharmacop\u0153ia and the \u03b1-bisabolol content of the essential oil constituent required by the product specification is established, the cardboard boxes receive a \u2018green\u2019 label, while the product receives a qualification document by indicating quantity and quality. The qualification document number is a specific identification of the \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 and refers exclusively to the product tested. If the product does not meet the requirements, it may not be placed on the market as \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019.\nDuring the process of putting the camomile into sachets and bags, a bagging logbook must be kept for every single operation. The distribution permit number appears alongside the amounts used and measured. The permit number and the manufacturing number specified in the bagging logbooks appear on the commercial packaging of the end products. These data can be used to trace the date of manufacture, as well as the identification number, amount and origin of the batch used.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gathering and transport\nThe flowers are picked in May and June, but often also as early as late April. The wild camomile is gathered using a camomile comb which can be made from wood, iron or tin. The flower is detached from the stem with the help of the teeth of the comb, then emptied into sacks. Flowers collected cold in sacks can be kept for up to 4 hours without any deterioration in quality. Larger quantities must be spread out in a 15-20\u00a0cm deep layer and may be placed in sacks using a wooden scoop only immediately before transport. As the camomile flower is fairly fragile, it should not be pressed or turned unnecessarily.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drying\nCamomile flowers can be dried naturally or artificially.\nThe traditional method of drying camomile flowers is natural drying in a loft. The cleaned flowers are spread out in the loft in an inch-deep layer. The flowers dry within 5-6 days in an airy loft that is easy to ventilate.\nWhen camomile flowers are dried artificially, the untreated flowers are spread out on a clean surface in a 15-20\u00a0cm deep layer, then gathered in baskets or other means of transport and tipped onto the conveyor belt. Drying can be carried out in a drier, on a crop-drying floor or in what is known as a tunnel-drying system.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stem removal, selection by hand\nThe adapted riddle system processes the dried camomile flowers which were tipped onto the stem-removing machine, removes the fallen petals, the middlings, the buds and any remaining impurities. The swing blades at the bottom and end of the riddle or topping rolls remove the stems, then the product arrives on the selection belt where it is subject to a further selection by hand and is packaged into 10\u00a0kg cardboard boxes for storage.\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Packaging\n\u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 is placed on the market in accordance with health and consumer protection requirements:\n\u2014 in aroma-preserving bags containing ground camomile a net weight of 1,2\u00a0g,\n\u2014 in aroma-preserving sachets containing full flowers a net weight of 2\u00a0g,\n\u2014 as bagged flowers in 50\u00a0g units,\n\u2014 in large cardboard boxes in 10\u00a0kg units.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link:\nHistory\nDr Ferenc Simonffy refers to the link between the southern part of the Great Hungarian plain and wild camomile in his book Adatok Sz\u00e9kkutas jelen\u00e9b\u0151l \u00e9s m\u00faltj\u00e1b\u00f3l \u2014 T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi megeml\u00e9kez\u00e9s a volt v\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi \u2018Nagypuszt\u00e1r\u00f3l\u2019 (Data from the present and the past of Sz\u00e9kkutas \u2014 A historical commemoration of the former \u2018Great Puszta\u2019 of V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely), in which he writes that \u2018camomile mainly grows in the saline areas of the Puszta.\u2019 The author mentions that a succession of customers came from the Northern countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Canada). According to the medical and chemical experts of those countries, \u2018this plant cannot be grown artificially because cultivated camomile does not contain the substances found in camomile growing wild and on saline soil\u2019.\nAfter the First World War, the rise in demand on the German market created the background for camomile\u2019s success. The Herb\u00e1ria Orsz\u00e1gos Gy\u00f3gyn\u00f6v\u00e9ny \u00e9s Selyemgub\u00f3forgalmi Sz\u00f6vetkezeti V\u00e1llalat (Herbarium National Medicinal Plant and Silk Cocoon Trading Cooperative) started production with a simple dryer in Sz\u00e9kkutas in 1936-37, initially engaging in the preservation and drying of vegetables. On 23 February 1939 the central representatives of the cooperative decided to extend their activities to include the gathering and industrial drying of camomile and to build a factory necessary for this purpose.\nGeographical link\nThe development of gathering, processing and sale of wild camomile is a valuable model example for the regional use of flora. The \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 owes its unique characteristics (see 4.2) to the ecological features of the habitat, that is the soil, the number of hours of sunshine and annual precipitation.\nFirst-class produce can be obtained from plants growing on the Great Hungarian Plain\u2019s saline Puszta that can hardly be used for any other purpose, but is rich in sunshine. Matricaria chamomilla, the basic material of \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019, is able to accumulate 10\u00a0mg/g of sodium salts in its root cells. This explains why it is able to utilise moisture on the saline soils of the Great Plain that cannot be used by other plants.\nThe number of hours of sunshine in the Great Plain varies between 2\u00a0000 and 2\u00a0100 a year, with an annual precipitation of around 500 to 600\u00a0mm. The high level of sunshine allows for an increased level of active agent accumulation while weather with less sunshine reduces the accumulation of active agents. Foreign research has also confirmed that high sunshine levels and heat (the main climatic features of the Great Plain area) have a beneficial effect on and influence the composition of the essential oil content of camomile (Saleh, 1973). Research results have also proven that lower precipitation levels lead to a reduction in the plant height and flower size of camomile (Gosztola et al., 2008). Also, alkaline and saline soils lead to diminished growth (Sztefanov et al., 2003; Balak et al., 1999). Numerous research projects conducted in Hungary into natural, wild-growing camomile have revealed that there is a sharp differentiation between the camomile populations of the Transdanubia and Great Plain areas in terms of morphology and content. Wild-growing camomile from areas with neutral or slightly acidy soils is of more robust growth and has larger flowers but its essential oil has a lower \u03b1-bisabolol content, while camomile picked in the more continental, saline areas of the Great Plain is smaller in growth, has a compact flower, but its essential oil contains a large amount of the valuable, antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory \u03b1-bisabolol, the main component of the essential oil. This reaches 20\u00a0% in any event, but may be as high as 45-58\u00a0% depending on the year (Gosztola et al., 2005; Sztefanov et al., 2003).\nIt can be established from the link between the product and the geographical environment of the Great Hungarian Plain \u2014 examined with respect to climate and soil \u2014 that the basic material of \u2018Alf\u00f6ldi kamillavir\u00e1gzat\u2019 consists of the low-growing camomile plant high in \u03b1-bisabolol, which grows exclusively in habitats of the Great Plain with the ecological conditions mentioned above.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body:\nName: Csongr\u00e1d Megyei \u00c9lelmiszerl\u00e1nc-biztons\u00e1gi \u00e9s \u00c1llateg\u00e9szs\u00e9g\u00fcgyi Igazgat\u00f3s\u00e1g (Csongr\u00e1d County Food Chain Safety and Animal Health Directorate)\nSzeged\nVasas Szent P\u00e9ter u. 9/a\n6700\nMAGYARORSZ\u00c1G/HUNGARY\nTel. +36 62422358 / 62551850\nFax +36 62426183\ne-mail: szigetis@oai.hu; csongrad_megye@oai.hu\nName: Hajd\u00fa-Bihar Megyei \u00c9lelmiszerl\u00e1nc-biztons\u00e1gi \u00e9s \u00c1llateg\u00e9szs\u00e9g\u00fcgyi Igazgat\u00f3s\u00e1g (Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Food Chain Safety and Animal Health Directorate)\nDebrecen\nDi\u00f3szegi \u00fat 30\n4030\nMAGYARORSZ\u00c1G/HUNGARY\nTel. +36 52526240\nFax +36 52442841\ne-mail: harsanyi@oai.hu\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling:\nBesides the details set forth in relevant legislation, the following must also be present on the consumer label:\n\u2014 product name \u2018ALF\u00d6LDI KAMILLAVIR\u00c1GZAT\u2019,\n\u2014 the indication \u2018wild growing\u2019,\n\u2014 \u2018filteres tea\u2019 (tea bags) or \u2018tasakolt tea\u2019 (tea sachets) under the product name,\n\u2014 graphical depiction of a camomile flower,\n\u2014 \u2018protected designation of origin\u2019 or its abbreviation (PDO),\n\u2014 the European Union logo (following registration).\nIf the product is packaged outside the geographical area indicated above, traceability to the place of origin must be guaranteed.
