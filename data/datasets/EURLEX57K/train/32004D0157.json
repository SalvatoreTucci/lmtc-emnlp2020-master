As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain \"appropriate measures\" within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nBy letter of 19 February 2003, the European Union informed you of its decision not to revoke the application of the \"appropriate measures\".\nToday, after a further 12-month period, the European Union considers that democratic principles are still not upheld in Zimbabwe and that no progress has been achieved by the Government of Zimbabwe in the five fields addressed by the 18 February 2002 Council Decision (end of politically motivated violence, free and fair elections, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, end of illegal farm occupations). Furthermore, the European Union notes that the Government of Zimbabwe has not taken any positive steps along the lines of the measures, considered as benchmarks to assess progress, which the European Union communicated to the SADC on the occasion of the last two SADC/EU Committee meetings.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union does not consider that the appropriate measures can be revoked.\nThe measures will only be revoked once conditions prevail which ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. The European Union reserves the right to take additional restrictive measures.\nThe European Union will closely follow developments in Zimbabwe and would once again like to emphasise that these measures do not penalise the Zimbabwean people and will continue with its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support of the population, in particular those in social sectors, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are not affected by these measures. For the season 2003-2004 the European Community contribution to food and humanitarian aid operations in Zimbabwe has amounted to EUR 85 million in addition to bilateral assistance provided by the Member States of the European Union.\nThe European Union desires to pursue the dialogue with Zimbabwe, on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and hopes that you will do everything you can to restore respect for the essential principles of the Partnership Agreement and to put the country on the path of social peace and economic recovery. This would permit the lifting of the suspension of the signing of the 9th EDF National Indicative Programme for Zimbabwe, thereby making possible the resumption of full cooperation instruments in the near future.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004050EN.006103.TIF\">\nFor the Council\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004050EN.006104.TIF\">"}
