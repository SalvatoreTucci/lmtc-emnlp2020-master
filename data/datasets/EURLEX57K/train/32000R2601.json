A harmonised methodology regarding such timing is necessary to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability requirement of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, in particular for products in respect of which there may be a difference between the time of purchase, payment, or delivery and the time of consumption.\n(4) The rules in this Regulation are consistent with the definitions laid down in the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European System of national and regional accounts in the Community(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 448/98(6) in so far as ESA 95 is consistent with the purposes of the HICP.\n(5) In particular, point 3.89 of ESA 95 states that goods and services should in general be recorded when the payables are created, that is, when the purchaser incurs a liability to the seller.\n(6) The HICP should reflect the price change to the base or reference period on the basis of the change in expenditure while maintaining the consumption pattern of households and composition of the consumer population.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7),", "main_body": ["Aim\nThe aim of this Regulation is to harmonise the timing or recording and entering purchaser prices into the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (hereinafter referred to as HICP) in order to ensure that HICPs are reliable and relevant and meet the comparability requirement laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.", "Timing\nPrices used in the HICP shall be the purchaser prices paid by households to purchase individual goods or services in monetary transactions.
