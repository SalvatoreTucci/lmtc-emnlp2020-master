This final report concluded that the results of the trial period were positive, as it is broadly recognised that the allocation of FISIM would lead to major improvements in the methodology of the ESA 95 and to a more accurate comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) levels within the European Union.\n(4) Since the findings of the final evaluation report on the reliability of the results obtained during the trial period have been positive, the method to be used for the allocation of FISIM must be adopted before 31 December 2002 in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 448/98.\n(5) In its final report presented to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission considered that two additional years could be useful in order to enable Member States to make further improvements in the sources and methods used for the allocation of FISIM.\n(6) The Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB), set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC(4), as amended by Decision 96/174/EC(5), has been consulted.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC),", "main_body": ["1.
