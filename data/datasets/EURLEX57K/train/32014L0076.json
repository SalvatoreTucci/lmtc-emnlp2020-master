Examples are neon signs, individual architectural illumination and special light emitters in the chemical analytical research. As HLDTs are used for indoor and outdoor applications and with an individual colour spectrum composition, they have to work reliably under sensitive and cold conditions with very high life expectations because they are often difficult to access. In order to function properly under these conditions, HLDTs require a minimum quantity of mercury.\n(3) The elimination or substitution of mercury in HLDTs and the complete substitution of HLDTs with other technologies such as LED is scientifically and technically impracticable. The use of mercury in HLDTs used for signs, decorative or architectural and specialist lighting and light-artwork should therefore be exempted from the prohibition. The use of mercury should be limited to the necessary minimum amount and the validity period should end 31 December 2018, in order to avoid adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
