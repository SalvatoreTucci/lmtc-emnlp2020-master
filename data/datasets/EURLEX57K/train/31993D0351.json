This average limit is,  however, increased to 1 ppm of fresh product (1 milligram per kilo of fresh weight) for the edible parts of the species listed in the Annex.", "The analysis method to be used in determining the total mercury content is that specified by Decision 90/515/EEC.", "1. Sampling plans shall be laid down for fresh and frozen fishery products by the competent authority. These shall take account on the one hand of the results obtained from national checks and within the framework of the monitoring system  carried out in accordance with Chapter V, part II point 3 B of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC and on the other hand of the following factors:\nA. Product type:\n(a) species listed in the Annex;\n(b) other species;\nB. The minimum number of samples to be taken per lot for each product category shall be:\n- category (a): 10 samples taken from 10 different individuals,\n- category (b): five samples taken from five different individuals.\n2. The analysis shall be carried out on the finely homogenized mixture of the samples so as to obtain the mean value of the mercury content.\nIn particular, in the case of fish of the species listed in the Annex, which are of various sizes, the samples taken must represent the composition of the lot.\n3. The sampling plans referred to in paragraph 1 and subsequent modifications thereof shall be notified to the Commission for information. The Commission shall inform the other Member States.", "The mean total mercury content referred to in Article 1 will be reviewed when new weekly permissible intakes for mercury are laid down at international level, and at the latest three years following the notification of this Decision, on the  basis of the data obtained from the sampling plans and communicated to the Commission by the Member States.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 May 1993.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 268, 24. 9. 1991, p. 15.\n(2) OJ No L 286, 18. 10. 1990, p. 33.\nANNEX\nSharks (all species)\nTuna (Thunnus spp.)\nLittle tuna (Euthynnus spp.)\nBonito (Sarda spp.)\nPlain bonito (Orcynopsis unicolor)\nSwordfish (Xiphias gladius)\nSailfish (Istiophorus platypterus)\nMarlin (Makaira spp.)\nEel (Anguilla spp.)\nBass (Dicentrarchus labrax)\nSturgeon (Acipenser spp.)\nHalibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)\nRedfish (Sebastes marinus, S. mentella)\nBlue ling (Molva dipterygia)\nAtlantic catfish (Anarhichas lupus)\nPike (Esox lucius)\nPortuguese dogfish (Centroscymnes coelolepis)\nRays (Raja spp.)\nScabbardfishes (Lepidopus caudatus, Aphanopus carbo)\nAnglerfish (Lophius spp.)"}
