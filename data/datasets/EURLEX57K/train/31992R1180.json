Council, the Court of Justice held that:\n'. . .\nAt the end of 1987 the cost of living in Munich was 8,3 % higher than in Bonn - the capital at that time - and that, in the absence of a specific weighting, such a significant difference reduced the purchasing power of officials serving in Munich in  comparison with that of their colleagues serving in Bonn.\nIn particular, in view of the wide discrepancy found in this case, the obligation to establish a specific weighting could not depend on the number of officials and other servants of the Communities concerned.\nWhereas as a result of these considerations the Regulation in question must be declared void insofar as it omits to fix a specific weighting for Munich with effect from 1 January 1988.';\nWhereas the above Judgment should be acted on by fixing a specific weighting for Munich with effect from 1 January 1988 and updated from that date to 1 July 1991,", "main_body": ["With effect from 1 January 1988, the weighting applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants serving in Munich shall be 107,8 %.", "With effect from 1 July 1988, the weighting applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants serving in Munich shall be 108,3 %.", "With effect from 1 July 1989, the weighting applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants serving in Munich shall be 107,3 %.", "With effect from 1 July 1990, the weighting applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants serving in Munich shall be 103,3 %.", "With effect from 1 July 1991, the weighting applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants serving in Munich shall be 102,8 %.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
