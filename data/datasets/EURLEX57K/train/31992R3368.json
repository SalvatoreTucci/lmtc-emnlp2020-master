By way of a transitional measure, for the 1993/94 marketing year and without prejudice to Article 2 (1) (c) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2294/92 (5), the Member States may set a closing date for producers sowing winter rape to submit  applications for advances on compensatory payments for oilseeds.\n2. The closing date referred to in paragraph 1 above may not be later than the date for the submission of applications for compensatory payments referred to in Article 2 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2294/92.", "1. Where Article 1 applies, the payment of the advance provided for in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 shall be subject to a written declaration by the producer comprising as a minimum a statement of:\n(a) the total area sown to winter rape for which they apply for an advance payment;\n(b) their irrevocable commitment to:\n- submit an application for the compensatory payment in due time in accordance with the detailed rules to be laid down subsequently,\n- meet their obligation to set aside land and all the requirements laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2294/92,\n- forego the option of the simplified scheme open to small producers,\n- not resow as a main crop the corresponding areas for that marketing year, except for agronomical or climatic reasons duly recognized by the competent authority of the Member State. In the latter case, the producer must resow an oilseed.", "1. Where Article 2 applies, the Member States shall be authorized to pay producers meeting the requirements laid down an advance equal to 50 % of the projected regional reference amount, calculated on the basis of figures forwarded to the  Commission with their regionalization plans as they stand at the date referred to in Article 1 (1).\n2. Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the Commission's right to seek to have regionalization plans revised by the Member States pursuant to Article 3 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.", "1. No advances shall be paid to producers to which the penalties provided for in Articles 14 (7) and (8) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 615/92 (6) apply.\n2. The Member States shall conduct the necessary administrative checks before paying any advances.", "1. The Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that producers' undertakings as set out in Article 2 above are met and to prevent areas covered by applications for compensatory payments differing from those indicated in the  corresponding applications for advances.\n2. The Member States shall notify the Commission of measures taken pursuant to this Regulation, and in particular those referred to in paragraph 1, by no later than 30 days after the closing date for the submission of applications for advances.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
