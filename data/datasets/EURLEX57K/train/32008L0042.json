Therefore, the restrictions should not be limited to the use of the identified substances as fragrance compounds in cosmetic products.\n(3) However, sensitisation would not exist when the substance is used in oral products. Therefore, in order to ensure consistency, as some of these substances are authorised as flavouring substances by Commission Decision 1999/217/EC of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996\u00a0(3), these restrictions should not apply to substances listed under this register.\n(4) In the light of the opinions of the SCCP, it is necessary to amend the restrictions related to the identified substances which are already listed in Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC under entries 45, 72, 73, 88 and 89. Furthermore, it is appropriate to include in that Annex those identified substances which are not yet listed with their respective restrictions, as well as, for consistency, substances belonging to the same family identified in Commission Decision 96/335/EC of 8 May 1996 establishing an inventory and a common nomenclature of ingredients employed in cosmetic products\u00a0(4).\n(5) Benzyl alcohol being listed twice in Annex III part 1, under reference numbers 45 and 68, the content of entry 68 as well as the new restrictions should be included in entry 45.\n(6) Following clarification by the SCCP regarding Peru balsam, entry 1136 of Annex II should be amended.\n(7) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In order to ensure a smooth progression from the existing formulae of cosmetic products to formulae which comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, it is necessary to provide for appropriate transitional periods.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III of Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that products which fail to comply with this Directive are not sold or disposed of to the final consumer after 4 October 2009.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 4 October 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
