In implementation of Article 16 of the VIS Regulation, measures should be adopted to set out rules for the exchange of the messages transmitted by the infrastructure of the VIS (VIS Mail Specifications). These messages shall not be recorded in the VIS and the personal data transmitted shall be used solely for the consultation of central visa authorities and consular cooperation.\n(2) Subject to further measures adopted by the date referred to in Article 46 of the VIS Regulation concerning the integration of the technical functionalities of the Schengen Consultation Network, the VIS Mail Specifications should define four types of messages which may be used from the start of operations of VIS until the date referred to in Article 46 of the VIS Regulation. These should include messages related to consular cooperation (Article 16(3) of the VIS Regulation), messages related to the transmission of requests to the competent visa authority to forward copies of travel documents and other documents supporting the application and to the transmission of electronic copies of those documents (Article 16(3) of the VIS Regulation), messages that data processed in the VIS are inaccurate or that data were processed in the VIS contrary to the provisions of the VIS Regulation (Article 24(2) of the VIS Regulation) and messages that an applicant has acquired the nationality of a Member State (Article 25(2) of the VIS Regulation).\n(3) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, on 13 October 2008 Denmark decided to implement Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in Danish law.

The United Kingdom is therefore not an addressee of this Commission Decision.\n(5) In accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland\u2019s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(3), Ireland has not taken part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application as it constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Ireland is therefore not an addressee of this Commission Decision.\n(6) This Decision constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2)

shall be based on Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, allowing transmission of information between Member States via the infrastructure of the Visa Information System (VIS).\nThe personal data transmitted within this mechanism pursuant to Article 16 of the VIS Regulation shall be used solely for the consultation of central visa authorities and consular cooperation.\nThe respective evolution of VIS Mail and VISION implies a phased process as depicted below:\nBefore VIS becomes operational, VISION shall be the unique communication network for consultations on visas\u00a0(1).\nIn Phase 1, from the start of operations of VIS, the VIS Mail mechanism may be used for transmission of following types of information:\n\u2014 messages related to consular cooperation,\n\u2014 requests for supporting documents,\n\u2014 messages on inaccurate data,\n\u2014 Member State nationality acquired by an applicant.\nThe provisions of the VIS Regulation concerning the use of VIS Mail for the transmission of information relating to consular cooperation and requests for supporting documents (Article 16(3)), for the amendment of data (Article 24(2)) and for advance data deletion (Article 25(2)) are applicable in Phase 1. The VIS Mail mechanism, including the central mail relay and the national mail servers, needs to be in place in case at least one Member State intends to use the mechanism in Phase 1 to ensure that this Member State is able to transmit such messages\u00a0(2). During Phase 1 of the VIS Mail operation, VISION shall be used in parallel.\nIn Phase 2, when all the Schengen visa issuing posts are connected to VIS, the VIS Mail mechanism shall replace the Schengen Consultation Network from the date determined in accordance with Article 46 of the VIS Regulation. As from this date all types of messages shall be exchanged via the VIS infrastructure by means of the VIS Mail mechanism.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SMTP Mail Exchange Infrastructure\nThe SMTP mail exchange shall use the VIS infrastructure, which includes national interfaces and the sTESTA network, and shall be based on national mail servers exchanging messages via a central mail relay infrastructure.\nThe central SMTP mail relay infrastructure shall be developed and installed in the VIS Central Unit and Back-up Central Unit sites. The management and monitoring of the mail relay including logging shall be provided by the Management Authority.\nThe national SMTP mail server infrastructure shall be prepared by the Member States. The national mail server infrastructure needs to be protected against unauthorised access to the messages.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Application Solution\nThe VIS Mail operations shall start in Phase 1 with business processes developed taking into account the technical solution of VISION to ensure a smooth switch-over between Phases 1 and 2 when VIS Mail will replace VISION.\nTechnical specifications describing the functionalities of the VIS Mail mechanism shall be without prejudice to the legal aspects of consular cooperation and visa procedures.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0This network is used for consultations between Member States, including representation, and for the exchange of information that a visa with limited territorial validity (VLTV) has been issued.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the VIS Mail mechanism may be used concerns the optional use of the mechanism itself, not the availability of the tool, which is then obligatory."}
