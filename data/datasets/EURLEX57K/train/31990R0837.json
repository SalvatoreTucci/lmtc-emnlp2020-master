These surveys shall be conducted using statistically recognized methods which meet the requirements on quality, objectivity and reliability as defined in this section.\n3. In order to meet the requirements of this section, transitional arrangements may be agreed upon for one or more Member States, in accordance with Article 8 (3).", "1. In the case of sample surveys on areas under cultivation, the samples must be designed so that they are representative of at least 95 % of the total area under cereal cultivation.\nThese area figures must be complemented by an estimate relying on data from other sources and relating to the remaining area under cereals.\n2. The sample surveys on areas must be designed so that the standard error for the total area under cereal cultivation in each individual Member State does not exceed the greater of 1 % of that area or 5 000 hectares.", "1. In the case of sample surveys on yield or production, the samples must be designed so that the standard error for the total cereal production does not exceed the greater of 2 % of total production or 50 000 tonnes.\n2. In addition to the requirements on total cereal production in paragraph 1, for each cereal referred to in Annex I of which production in the Member State exceeds the threshold laid down in Article 3 (1), the standard error for the production of the cereal should not exceed the greater of 5 % of that production or 20 000 tonnes.\nSECTION IV\nData to be supplied at regional level", "Annual data on the area under cultivation, yields, production and moisture content must be forwarded to Eurostat at the regional levels defined in Annex III.\nAnnex III may be amended in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 11.\nThese regional data must be supplied for total cereals, excluding rice, and for common wheat, durum wheat, rye, barley and grain maize.\nThe Member States shall indicate those regional figures having exceptionally high percentage standard errors.\nSECTION V\nDeadlines, exchange of experience and transitional arrangements", "1.

Within 12 months of the entry into force of this Regulation, Member States shall submit a detailed methodological report to Eurostat describing how the data for areas under cultivation, yield and production are derived for their countries and, where appropriate, regions and indicate the representativeness and reliability of these figures. Eurostat, in collaboration with the Member States, shall compile a summary of these reports.\n2. Member States shall inform Eurostat of any modifications to the information provided under paragraph 1 within three months of their introduction.\n3.
