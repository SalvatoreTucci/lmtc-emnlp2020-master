The poultry holdings in the established buffer zones have been depopulated and restocking will start following a waiting period after cleaning and disinfection has been carried out.\n(5) Following a further waiting period until 26 May 2003, provided that no new outbreaks have been reported it would seem appropriate to limit the trade restrictions in force to the previously disease affected areas and an appropriate buffer zone around this area and to allow trade in live poultry and poultry products from the rest of the Belgian territory, which could then be considered as free of avian influenza.\n(6) The animal health certificates to be possibly used as from 27 May 2003 for consignments of live poultry and hatching eggs originating from the regionalised area in Belgium and destined for another Member State or third country should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures laid down in Decision 2003/289/EC should be further prolonged and adapted in the light of the evolution of the disease.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/289/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
