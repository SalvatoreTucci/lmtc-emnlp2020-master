The Annex to that Regulation sets out the requirements for those elements.\n(3) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 currently provides that animals intended for slaughter before the age of 12 months and not intended for intra-Community trade or export to third countries may be identified with a method complying with the conditions set out in Section A.7 of the Annex to that Regulation. However, in some cases animals which were originally intended for slaughter are nevertheless used for breeding later in holdings other than that of birth. It should therefore be permitted to allow such animals to be individually identified after they have left their holding of birth provided that the individual animal can be traced back to its holding of birth.\n(4) Section C of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 sets out the information which should be contained in the movement document. In order to record the individual identification code of each animal on the movement document, animals are to be individually read at departure. Animals are read again in the holding of destination. In order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be permitted to allow the identification codes of animals to be recorded at the holding of destination, instead of at the holding of departure subject to certain conditions.\n(5) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides for certain keepers to keep an inventory of animals at least annually. Part D of the Annex to that Regulation provides for certain information to be contained in the computer database. The results of the inventory are part of that information. In order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be permissible not to record such results in those Member States where the computer database contains, in addition to the information required pursuant to Part D of that Annex, the individual identification codes of each animal on holdings.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 August 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a05, 9.1.2004, p.\u00a08.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 is amended as follows:\n1. in Section A, point 7, the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n2. in Section C, point 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
