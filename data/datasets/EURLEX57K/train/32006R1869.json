In view of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union on 1 January 2007, the deadline for the submission of applications for the import tariff quota period 1 January to 31 December 2007 was extended to 8 January 2007 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1677/2006 of 14 November 2006 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005, as regards the date of application for import rights for the tariff quota period 1 January to 31 December 2007\u00a0(3).\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(4) applies to import licences for import tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed provisions on applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation provides that import tariff quotas shall be opened for a period of 12 consecutive months and limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to imports licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005, without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down in that Regulation. It is necessary to align the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 on Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 where appropriate.\n(3) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in trade of a significant scale with third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during both reference periods referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. Moreover, for administrative reasons, Member States should be allowed to accept certified copies of the documents proving the existence of trade with third countries.\n(4) In case the application of the allocation coefficient referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 gives a figure of less than 50 head per application, the quantity available should be awarded by the Member States concerned by drawing lots for import rights covering 50 head each, in order to ensure a commercially viable number of animals per application.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.
