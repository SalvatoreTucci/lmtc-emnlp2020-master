At the time, two types of TSE potentially present in ovine or caprine animals, namely scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), could not be routinely discriminated in ovine or caprine animals. Strict measures were therefore introduced on the grounds that every TSE case in ovine or caprine animals could be BSE.\n(3) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 36/2005\u00a0(3), since January 2005 discriminatory testing has been mandatory in all confirmed TSE cases in ovine and caprine animals. Following the stepping-up of surveillance in ovine and caprine animals in 2005 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2005\u00a0(4), preliminary results indicate that BSE can be ruled out in all positive TSE cases to date. Measures for the eradication of TSEs in ovine and caprine animals will be reconsidered in the framework of the TSE road map. Discussion on the subject will, however, not be finalised before the end of 2005.\n(4) In order to prevent stricter measures to eradicate TSEs in ovine animals becoming applicable despite ongoing discussion on their possible review, transitional measures currently applying until 1 January 2006 on the restocking of flocks culled in connection with TSE eradication should be extended.\n(5) In its report of 2 September 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended the approval of a new BSE rapid post-mortem test. That test should be included in the list of rapid tests for monitoring BSE.\n(6) Until now, no formal evaluation of tests specifically for the purpose of testing ovine or caprine animals has been completed. Five rapid tests currently listed in Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 were provisionally approved, pending evaluation, for the monitoring programme in ovine and caprine animals on the basis of data provided by the test manufacturers.\n(7) In its reports of 17 May and 26 September 2005 on the evaluation of rapid post-mortem tests intended for ovine and caprine animals, the EFSA recommended the approval of eight new rapid post-mortem tests, including the five provisionally approved rapid tests. These tests should be included in the list of rapid tests for monitoring TSEs in ovine and caprine animals.\n(8) Changes to rapid tests and to test protocols may only be made with the approval of the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs. The CRL has approved changes to the BSE rapid post-mortem test called \u2018Inpro CDI\u2019. The CRL has also accepted the change of name to \u2018Beckman Coulter InPro CDI kit\u2019.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes VII and X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.
