Purpose of the programme\nDevelopment of the processing and marketing of fish and fish products (but excluding fish meal and fish oil).\n2. Delimitation of the area concerned by the programme\nThe whole of Denmark except Greenland and the Faeroes.\n3. Duration of the programme\nThe programme covers the period 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1990.\n4. Objectives of the programme\nThe programme aims to build on the achievements of the preceding programme and emphasizes the need for investments concerning:\n- a continuous rationalization and modernization of the industry,\n- the introduction of new production methods,\n- improvement in the quality of the final product and of the raw materials,\n- more sophisticated production (prepared dishes),\nrather than the need to create new production capacity which is very much dependent on the supply of raw materials.\n5. Priorities\nThe programme does not indicate any priorities as regards the different types of investments envisaged.\n6. The estimated investment needs\nThe total amount of investment for the duration of the programme is Dkr 1 000 to Dkr 1 250 million (122 to 155 million ECU) to attain the foreseen objectives.\nThe national aid is scheduled at Dkr 65 to Dkr 70 million (8 to 9 million ECU) attributed in approximately equal annual proportions.\nThe programme does not indicate a breakdown between the various types of investments.\nFinal conclusions\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by Denmark as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of resources and of the consequences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n2. Given that the structural measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture foreseen for 1987 and later may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for processing and marketing of fish products.\n3. Furthermore, investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n4. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product.\n5. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in this programme do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community."}
