The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive.\n(2) Developments in technology now enable Directive 93/31/EEC to be adapted to technical progress. In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is therefore necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of the Directive concerned.\n(3) To this end, it should be specified that when conducting stability tests on an inclined surface, the transverse and longitudinal tilt tests should be carried out separately.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/40/EC(5),", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 93/31/EEC is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
