It enumerates the different surveys and data sources to which it applies.\n(2) There is a growing demand by researchers and scientific community in general to have access for scientific purposes also to confidential data from the Structure of Earnings Survey. The Structure of Earnings Survey represents EU-wide harmonised structural data on gross earnings, hours paid and annual days of paid holiday leave which are collected every four years under Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 of 9 March 1999 concerning structural statistics on earnings and on labour costs\u00a0(3). Access to this confidential data would largely benefit the research work on earnings of individuals and their relation with the characteristics of the employer. This survey should therefore be added to the enumeration in Regulation (EC) No 831/2002.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Statistical Confidentiality,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 is amended as follows:\n1.
