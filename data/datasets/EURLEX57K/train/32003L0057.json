Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended in order to include the maximum levels for dioxins, established by Directive 1999/29/EC.\n(4) In order to avoid any confusion it is appropriate to specify that minerals refer to the feed materials in the meaning of the Annex of Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation and use of feed materials(4) as last amended by Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5).\n(5) For greater clarity the rules governing dioxins should be collected in a single text. As a result, it is appropriate to amend Directive 2002/32/EC by inserting as an annex thereto the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2439/1999 of 17 November 1999 on the conditions for the authorisation of additives belonging to the group \"binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants\" in feedingstuffs(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 739/2000(7), which establishes a provisional maximum limit for kaolinitic clays and other additives authorised for use as binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants. As no or insufficient monitoring data on the presence of dioxins have been provided for calcium sulphate dihydrate, vermiculite, natrolite-phonolite, synthetic calcium aluminates and clinoptilolite of sedimentary origin demonstrating the absence of contamination by dioxins or contamination at levels below the limit of quantification, it is therefore appropriate in order to protect animal and human health to establish for these additives a maximum level for dioxins in addition to the maximum level for dioxins in kaolinitic clay. As a result, Regulation (EC) 2439/1999 can be repealed.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.

The products, processed animal proteins produced from these animals (fur animals, pet animals, zoo and circus animals) cannot enter the food chain and the feeding thereof is prohibited to farmed animals which are kept, fattened or bred for the production of food.\""}
