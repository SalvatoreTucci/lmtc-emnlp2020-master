Pursuant to the DSU, the Dispute Settlement Body (\"DSB\") was established.\n(4) With a view to permitting the Community, where it considers this appropriate, to bring a measure taken under Regulation (EC) No 384/96 or Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in a report adopted by the DSB, specific provisions must be introduced.\n(5) The Community institutions may consider it appropriate to repeal, amend or adopt any other special measures with respect to measures taken under Regulation (EC) No 384/96 or Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, including measures which have not been the subject of dispute settlement under the DSU, in order to take account of the legal interpretations made in a report adopted by the DSB. In addition, the Community institutions should be able, where appropriate, to suspend or review such measures.\n(6) Recourse to the DSU is not subject to time limits. The recommendations in reports adopted by the DSB only have prospective effect.
