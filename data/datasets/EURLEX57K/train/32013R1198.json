Interested parties were invited to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.\n(5) All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(6) On 10 April 2013, the Commission made imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia subject to registration under Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0330/2013\u00a0(3).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(7) By a letter dated 7 October 2013 to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.\n(8) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would be against the Union interest. Therefore the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. However, the Commission received no comments which would lead to the conclusion that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia should be terminated.\n(11) The registration of imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia, established in application of Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 330/2013, should therefore be discontinued and the said Regulation repealed,", "main_body": ["The anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a01516\u00a020\u00a098, ex\u00a01518\u00a000\u00a091, ex\u00a01518\u00a000\u00a095, ex\u00a01518\u00a000\u00a099, ex\u00a02710\u00a019\u00a043, ex\u00a02710\u00a019\u00a046, ex\u00a02710\u00a019\u00a047, 2710\u00a020\u00a011, 2710\u00a020\u00a015, 2710\u00a020\u00a017, ex\u00a03824\u00a090\u00a097, 3826\u00a000\u00a010 and ex\u00a03826\u00a000\u00a090, and originating in Argentina and Indonesia, is hereby terminated.", "Customs authorities are directed to discontinue the registration of imports, established in application of Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 330/2013.", "Regulation (EU) No 330/2013 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 188, 18.7.2009, p. 93.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 342, 10.11.2012, p. 12.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 102, 11.4.2013, p. 13."}
