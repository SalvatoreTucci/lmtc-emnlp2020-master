Member States shall ensure that classification is carried out by qualified technicians who  have obtained a licence for this purpose. The licence may be replaced by an approval granted by the  Member State where such approval corresponds to recognition of a qualification.\nThe performance of the classifiers operating regularly in approved establishments which slaughter  more than 75 adult bovine animals per week as an annual average will be monitored quarterly by the  way of an unannounced individual test carried out on 40 carcases. However in approved  establishments where only one classifier regularly operates and where less than 40 carcases are  available, the test shall be carried out on the number of carcases actually available, provided  that this is at least 25. The test shall be operated by a body independent of the slaughterhouse  and of the classification agencies and shall count towards the inspections required under paragraph  2. However the requirement to be independent of the classification agency shall not apply where the  competent authority itself carried out such controls.\n2.  Classification and identification of the carcases in the establishments covered by Article 1 of  Regulation (EEC) No 1186/90 shall be checked on the spot without prior warning of a body  independent of the slaughterhouse.\nChecks must be carried out at least twice every three months in all approved establishments which  operate classification and must relate to at least the same number of carcases referred to in the  second subparagraph of paragraph 1, selected at random. However, in the case of the approved  establishments referred to in the first indent of Article 2 (2) and of approved establishments  where only one classifier regularly operates, frequency of the checks may be reduced to once every  three months only.\nWhere the body responsible for checks is the same as that responsible for classification and  identification of the carcases or where it does not fall under the authority of a public body, the  checks provided for in the preceding subparagraph must be carried out under the physical  supervision of a public body under the same conditions and at least once a year. The public body  shall be informed regularly of the findings of the body responsible for checks.\nIn cases where a significant number of incorrect classifications or of identifications failing to  comply with the rules is ascertained during these inspections:\n(a)  the number of carcases inspected and the frequency of spot checks shall be increased; and (b)  the licence provided for in the preceding paragraph may be revoked.\nInspection reports referring to the controls undertaken under this Article shall be made and kept  by the national controlling bodies. These reports shall include in particular the number of  carcases checked and the number of those which were incorrectly classified or identified. They  shall also give full details of the type of dressings used, and where applicable, of their  conformity with Community rules.`", "Member States shall adopt whatever other measures are required for application of this  Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 1 September 1995.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 1995.\nFor the Commission Erkki LIIKANEN Member of the Commission"}
