Method of calculating and expressing energy value\nThe energy value of dog and cat food intended for particular nutritional purposes must be calculated using the formula set out below, on the basis of the percentages of certain analytical constituents of the food; this value is expressed in megajoules (MJ) of metabolizable energy (ME) per kilogram of compound feedingstuff, thus:\n(a) dog and cat food with the exception of cat food with a moisture content exceeding 14 %:\nMJ/kg of ME = 0,1464 \u00d7 % crude protein + 0,3556 \u00d7 % crude oils and fats + 0,1464 \u00d7 % nitrogen-free extract\n(b) cat food with a moisture content exceeding 14 %:\nMJ/kg of ME = (0,1632 \u00d7 % crude protein + 0,3222 \u00d7 % crude oils and fats + 0,1255 \u00d7 % nitrogen-free extract) - 0,2092\nwhere the percentage of nitrogen-free extract is calculated by taking the difference between 100 and the percentage of moisture, crude ash, crude protein, crude oils and fats and crude fibre.\n2. Tolerances applicable to the declared values\nIf the official inspection provided for in Article 12 of Directive 79/373/EEC reveals a discrepancy between the result of the inspection and the declared energy value (increased or reduced energy value of the feedingstuff), a tolerance of 15 % shall be applied.\n3. Expression of result\nAfter application of the above formula, the result obtained must be given to one decimal place.\n4. Sampling and analysis methods\nSampling of the compound feed and determination of the content of the analytical constituents indicated in the method of calculation must be performed in accordance with, respectively, Community sampling methods and analysis methods for the official control of feedingstuffs."}
