Annex II to that Regulation lays down national ceilings as regards the suckler-cow premiums. Those ceilings must not affect the introduction of the specific limits mentioned above. As a consequence it should be stipulated as of now that in the case of France, Portugal and Spain those ceilings are to include sub-ceilings that are based on the number of premiums paid in respect of a reference year to producers in the French overseas departments, the Azores and Madeira and the Canary Islands and are intended exclusively for producers in those regions.
