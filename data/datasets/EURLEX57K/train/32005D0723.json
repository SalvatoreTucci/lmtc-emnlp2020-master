For financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of that Regulation are to apply.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(3) lays down rules for monitoring and eradication of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.\n(4) In drawing up the lists of programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases, the list of programmes of checks aimed at the prevention of zoonoses and the list of programmes for the eradication and the monitoring of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community for 2006, and the proposed rate and maximum amount of the contribution for each programme, the interest of each programme for the Community, its compliance with the technical provisions of relevant Community veterinary legislation and the volume of available appropriations must be taken into account.\n(5) The Member States have supplied the Commission with information enabling it to assess the interest for the Community of providing a financial contribution to the programmes for 2006.\n(6) The Commission has considered each of the programmes submitted from both the veterinary and the financial point of view and is satisfied that those programmes should be included in the lists of programmes qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n(7) In view of the importance of those programmes for the protection of public and animal health, as well as the obligatory application in all Member States in the case of the TSE programmes, the most appropriate level of financial assistance from the Community should be ensured.\n(8) It is therefore appropriate to adopt the list of programmes qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006 and to set the proposed rate and the maximum amount of those contributions.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases listed in Annex I shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes of checks aimed at the prevention of zoonoses listed in Annex II shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex II.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the monitoring of TSE (BSE and scrapie) listed in Annex III shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex III.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the eradication of BSE listed in Annex IV shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex IV.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programmes for the eradication of scrapie listed in Annex V shall qualify for a financial contribution from the Community in 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each programme as referred to in paragraph 1, the proposed rate and maximum amount of the financial contribution from the Community shall be as set out in Annex V.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
