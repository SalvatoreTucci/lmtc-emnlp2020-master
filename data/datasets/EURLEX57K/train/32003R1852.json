Such authorisation may be given for a period of 10 years if all the relevant conditions laid down in that Directive are satisfied.\n(3) The assessment of the application for an authorisation for a period of 10 years submitted in respect of the coccidiostat preparation, \"Sacox 120 microGranulate\", shows that the relevant conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC are satisfied.\nThe Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety and the favourable effects of the coccidiostat preparation which belongs to the group \"Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\", for chickens reared for laying.\n(4) Accordingly, the coccidiostat preparation \"Sacox 120 microGranulate\" should be authorised for a period of 10 years and included in the list of authorised additives linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation and authorised for a period of 10 years as provided for in Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The assessment of the application shows that certain procedures are required to protect workers from exposure to the additive \"Sacox 120 microGranulate\". However, such protection is assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(3).\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The additive \"Sacox 120 microGranulate\" belonging to the group \"Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\" as set out in the Annex is authorised for use as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 October 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 269, 21.10.2003, p. 3.\n(3) OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
