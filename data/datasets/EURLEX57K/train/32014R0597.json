Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is appropriate to align those powers to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(2) In order to ensure the efficient adaptation of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0812/2004 to technical and scientific progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of technical specifications and conditions relating to the signal characteristics and implementation characteristics of the use of acoustic deterrent devices. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(3) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0812/2004 laying down rules on the procedure and format for reporting by Member States, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4).\n(4) In view of the requirement for Member States to take the necessary measures to establish a system of strict protection for cetaceans in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\u00a0812/2004, and given the shortcomings of that Regulation identified by the Commission, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the provisions of that Regulation for protecting cetaceans should be reviewed by 31 December 2015. On the basis of that review, the Commission should, if appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council an overarching legislative proposal for ensuring the effective protection of cetaceans, including through the regionalisation process.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0812/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0812/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 3, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 7, the following paragraph is added:\n(3) Article 8 is replaced by the following:\n(4) the following Articles are inserted:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 16 April 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
