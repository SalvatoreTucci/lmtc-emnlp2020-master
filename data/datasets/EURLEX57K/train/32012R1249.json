The use of common formats also facilitates the reconciliation of data between CCPs.\n(3) A CCP should be required to retain data for record keeping purposes in a format compatible with the format in which data is retained by trade repositories, taking into account that in certain circumstances CCPs and trade repositories are required to maintain or report the same information. The use of a common format across different financial market infrastructures facilitates the greater use of these formats by a wide variety of market participants, thus promoting standardisation.\n(4) To facilitate straight through processing and reduction of costs to market participants, it is important to use standardised procedures and data formats across CCPs as much as possible.\n(5) The underlying should be identified by using a single identifier, however there is currently no market wide standardised code to identify the underlyings within a basket. CCPs should therefore indicate at least that the underlying is a basket and use International Securities Identification numbers (ISINs) for standardised indices where possible.\n(6) This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.\n(7) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)\u00a0(3), ESMA has conducted an open public consultation before submitting the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010,", "main_body": ["Formats of records\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A CCP shall retain the records specified in Article 20 of the delegated act with regard to regulatory technical standards on requirements specifying the details of the records and information to be kept by central counterparties (CCPs) adopted pursuant to Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for each contract processed in the format set out in Table 1 in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A CCP shall retain the records specified in Article 21 of the delegated act with regard to regulatory technical standards on requirements specifying the details of the records and information to be kept by central counterparties (CCPs) adopted pursuant to Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for each position in the format set out in Table 2 in the Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A CCP shall retain the records specified in Article 22 of the delegated act with regard to regulatory technical standards on requirements specifying the details of the records and information to be kept by central counterparties (CCPs) adopted pursuant to Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for activities related to its business and internal organisation in the format set out in Table 3 in the Annex.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A CCP shall provide the competent authority the records and information under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 in a format that allows a direct data feed between the CCP and the competent authority.
