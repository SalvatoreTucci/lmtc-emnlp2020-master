To that end, an overall amount of 160\u00a0000 tonnes has been made available for the purpose of issuing import licences under that tariff quota.\n(3) The tariff quota provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 for 2006 should therefore be opened and the provisions for its administration laid down for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006.\n(4) As is the case for non-preferential imports, a method of administering the tariff quota should be adopted so as to favour international trade and smoother trade flows. The most appropriate method for this purpose would be that using the quota by chronological order of acceptance of the declarations of release for free circulation (the \u2018first come, first served\u2019 method). Nevertheless, in order to ensure continuity of trade with ACP countries and, therefore, satisfactory supplies for the Community market while avoiding disturbances in trade flows, part of the tariff quota should for the time being be reserved for operators who supplied the Community with ACP bananas under the import arrangements previously in force.\n(5) Provision should therefore be made for a total quantity of 146\u00a0850 tonnes of the tariff quota to be reserved for the operators who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community during 2005. That proportion of the tariff quota should be administered by means of import licences issued to each operator in proportion to the quantities released for free circulation during 2005.\n(6) In view of the quantities available, a ceiling should be set for the licence application which each operator may lodge for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006.\n(7) Access to the rest of the tariff quota should be open to all operators established in the Community on a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3).\n(8) As a result of the entry into force of the common customs tariff rate for bananas established by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005, the import tariff quota arrangements established by Title IV of Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas\u00a0(4) ceased applying on 31 December 2005 as provided for in Article 16(1) of that Regulation. The rules for administering tariff quotas provided for in Title IV of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001\u00a0(5) are therefore null and void.\n(9) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 should therefore be repealed. Nevertheless, some of its provisions should remain in force, particularly as regards the communication of information by the Member States which has been found useful for the purposes of administering the imports under this Regulation.\n(10) This Regulation should enter into force immediately in order to enable licence applications to be lodged in time.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS", "Subject\nThe zero-duty tariff quota for the import of bananas falling under CN code 0803\u00a000\u00a019 originating in ACP countries provided for in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 is hereby opened for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006.", "Available quantities\nThe quantities available under the tariff quota are set at 615\u00a0000 tonnes, of which:\n(a) 146\u00a0850 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter II and have the serial number 09.4164.\n(b) 468\u00a0150 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter III and have the serial numbers: 09.1638, 09.1639, 09.1640, 09.1642 and 09.1644.\nCHAPTER II\nIMPORTS OF THE QUANTITIES PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 2(A)", "Import licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All imports under the quantity referred to in Article 2(a) shall be subject to the lodging of an import licence issued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(6) shall be applicable, with the exception of Article 8(4) and (5), subject to the provisions of this Regulation.", "Lodging licence applications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Economic operators established in the Community who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community in 2005 shall be entitled to lodge import licence applications.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantities applied for by each operator may not exceed 40 % of the quantities of bananas originating in ACP countries which he released for free circulation in the Community during 2005.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications must be lodged by each operator on 15 and 16 February 2006 with the competent authorities of the Member State which issued him in 2005 with the import licences for the quantities referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe competent authorities shall be those listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 896/2001.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications shall be accompanied by a copy of the licence(s) used in 2005 to import bananas originating in ACP countries, duly endorsed, and the documents proving the ACP origin of the quantities under those licences, and the proof of lodging of a security in accordance with Title III of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85\u00a0(7).
