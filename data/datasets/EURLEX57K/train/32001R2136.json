Article 4 of the said Regulation provides that the Community financial contribution is to be granted per calendar year for a period of five consecutive years starting from 1997, within the limit of the annual appropriations authorised by the budget authority in the light of the financial perspective.\n(2) The Commission has transmitted to the Council a report on the results of the application of Regulation (EC) No 723/97 during the period 1997 to 2000. Given the assessment reports prepared by the Member States and the effectiveness of the programmes implemented, the Commission considers that Member States should continue to receive financial assistance for the implementation of the programmes provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.\n(3) In particular, since new expensive techniques have been introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1593/2000 of 17 July 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(4), in the area of the improvement of the agricultural parcel identification system having recourse to the technique of geographical information system and of digital orthophotography, a Community contribution is justified to cover part of the expenditure incurred by Member States in the framework of new action programmes covering this domain. In this context, it is appropriate, for reasons of legal clarity, to delete the last indent of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.\n(4) The period during which Community financial contribution may be paid should therefore be extended by two years.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 723/97 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 723/97 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. In Article 2(1) the second subparagraph shall be replaced by the following: \"However, for programmes relating to the year 2002, the time limit for submission of action programmes to the Commission shall be 31 January 2002.\"\n2.
