Provisional action\n(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, originating in the German Democratic Republic.\nB. Subsequent procedure\n(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the exporter of the product concerned made his views known in writing and requested an opportunity to be heard by the Commission which was granted.\nC. Dumping\n(3) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty, therefore the Commission confirms its findings on the dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 to be definitive.\nD. Injury\n(4) No fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry has been submitted, therefore the Commission confirms the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84.\nE. Community interest\n(5) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken.\nF. Undertaking\n(6) The exporter concerned was informed of the main findings of the investigation and commented on them. An undertaking was subsequently offered by the exporter concerning his exports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, to the Community.\n(7) This undertaking was considered acceptable by the Commission and the proceeding is therefore being terminated without imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty.\nG. Definitive collection of the provisional duties\n(8) The Commission considers that the dumped imports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, originating in the German Democratic Republic, have caused material injury to the Community industry concerned. Therefore the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty should be definitively collected in their entirety.\n(9) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,", "main_body": ["The amounts secured by way of a provisional anti-dumping duty under Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 shall be definitively collected.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 August 1984.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
