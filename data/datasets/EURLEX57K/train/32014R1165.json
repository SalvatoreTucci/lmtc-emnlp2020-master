In accordance with Article 3 of that Regulation the agricultural products listed in Annex III thereto are to be admitted for import into the Union within the limits of the tariff quotas as set out in that Annex. Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02535/2001\u00a0(3) has been amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 415/2014\u00a0(4) to include the tariff quotas for dairy products referred to in Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 which are open until 31 October 2014.\n(2) Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 has been amended by Regulation (EU) No 1150/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5). The amendment primarily provides for the extension of the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 until 31 December 2015 and in fixing the quantities of the quotas for 2015. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the management of the tariff quotas referred to in Article 5(l) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02535/2001 for 2015.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, Part L is replaced by the text which is set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 20.12.2013, p.\u00a0671.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine (OJ L\u00a0118, 22.4.2014, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas (OJ L\u00a0341, 22.12.2001, p.\u00a029).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 415/2014 of 23 April 2014 amending and derogating from Regulation (EC) No\u00a02535/2001 as regards the management of the tariff quotas for dairy products originating in Ukraine (OJ L\u00a0121, 24.4.2014, p.\u00a049).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 1150/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 October 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine (OJ L 313, 31.10.2014, p. 1).\nANNEX\n\u2018I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L\nTARIFF QUOTAS REFERRED TO IN ANNEX III TO REGULATION (EU) No 374/2014\nAnnual quota from 1 January to 31 December\nQuota Number CN Code Description\u00a0(1) Country of origin Import period Quota quantity Quota quantity Import duty (EUR/100 kg net weight)\n09.4600 0401 Milk and cream, not in powder, granules or other solid forms; yoghurt, not flavoured or containing added fruit, nuts or cocoa; fermented or acidified milk products, not flavoured or containing added fruit, nuts or cocoa and not in powder, granules or other solid forms UKRAINE Year 2014 8\u00a0000 \u2014 0\n0402\u00a091\n0402\u00a099\n0403\u00a010\u00a011\n0403\u00a010\u00a013\n0403\u00a010\u00a019\n0403\u00a010\u00a031\n0403\u00a010\u00a033\n0403\u00a010\u00a039\n0403\u00a090\u00a051\n0403\u00a090\u00a053\n0403\u00a090\u00a059\n0403\u00a090\u00a061\n0403\u00a090\u00a063\n0403\u00a090\u00a069\n09.4601 0402\u00a010 Milk and cream, in powder, granules or other solid forms; fermented or acidified milk products, in powder, granules or other solid forms, not flavoured or containing added fruit, nuts or cocoa; products consisting of natural milk constituents, not elsewhere specified or included UKRAINE Year 2014 1\u00a0500 \u2014 0\n0402\u00a021\n0402\u00a029\n0403\u00a090\u00a011\n0403\u00a090\u00a013\n0403\u00a090\u00a019\n0403\u00a090\u00a031\n0403\u00a090\u00a033\n0403\u00a090\u00a039\n0404\u00a090\u00a021\n0404\u00a090\u00a023\n0404\u00a090\u00a029\n0404\u00a090\u00a081\n0404\u00a090\u00a083\n0404\u00a090\u00a089\n09.4602 0405\u00a010 Butter and other fats and oils derived from milk; dairy spreads of a fat content, by weight, of more than 75 % but less than 80 % UKRAINE Year 2014 1\u00a0500 \u2014 0\n0405\u00a020\u00a090\n0405\u00a090\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the rules on the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the description of products shall be regarded as merely indicative, since the applicability of the preferential arrangements is determined, within the context of this Annex, by the scope of the CN\u00a0codes.\u2019"}
