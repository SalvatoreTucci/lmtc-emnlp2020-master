The aim of the new Directive is to ensure both a high level of health and safety protection for workers and the continuation and development of medical and other industrial activities using electromagnetic fields. Consequently, anticipating the adoption of the new Directive by 30 April 2012, the majority of Member States have not transposed Directive 2004/40/EC.\n(5) However, given the technical complexity of the subject matter, it is unlikely that the new Directive will be adopted by 30 April 2012.\n(6) Consequently, the deadline of 30 April 2012 should be extended. It is therefore necessary for this Directive to enter into force on the day of its publication,", "main_body": ["In Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/40/EC, the date \u201830 April 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 October 2013\u2019.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 19 April 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
