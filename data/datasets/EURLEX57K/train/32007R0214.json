To reduce the administrative burden and costs at importation and to promote uniformity of treatment, provision has been made that certain tariff quotas are to be considered as critical. Experience with the system and improved use of electronic exchange of data between the Member States and the Commission have shown that the criteria used in determining the critical status can be further relaxed without a risk to the Community's own resources. Accordingly a tariff quota should be considered as critical where 90\u00a0% of the initial quota volume, instead of 75\u00a0% as in the current system, has been used.\n(2) The need to carry out surveillance of goods in order to obtain data related to imports and exports has increased considerably. As a consequence, in cases of surveillance of goods, Member States should provide to the Commission, more frequently than under the current system, data on customs declarations for release for free circulation or on export declarations. Where such data are not available or are only partially available on the date of the customs declaration under a simplified procedure, they should be provided afterwards.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as follows:\n1.
