Experience has confirmed that in order that their reported results can be used with confidence, laboratories undertaking analyses of pesticide residues must operate with high levels of quality assurance. The participation of laboratories in regular proficiency tests and their implementation of common quality control procedures, may serve to fulfil the accreditation requirements of Article 3 of Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(4).\n(4) Because the Commission, in collating and compiling the information submitted by the Member States for presentation as European Community reports, must have confidence in the quality, accuracy and comparability of that information it is appropriate, that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support the undertaking at the highest standards achievable of the monitoring programmes. In particular the regular proficiency tests of laboratories and the review and development of quality control procedure guidelines at regular specialist meetings should be supported.\n(5) It is appropriate that the Commission should contribute financially to actions which support other aspects of the coordination of pesticide residue monitoring at Community level. In particular work should be supported to allow the Commission to respond to the requirement that it should work progressively towards a system which would permit the estimation of actual dietary exposure from monitoring data.\n(6) The communication from the Commission on consumer health and food safety (COM(97) 183) describes the operation of the food; veterinary and phytosanitary control and inspection services. The monitoring of pesticide residues in and on cereals and fruit and vegetables is an activity which should be covered by the inspection service.\n(7) The monitoring exercises for 1996 and 1997 demonstrated infringements of the maximum levels as laid down in Directive 90/642/EEC as amended.\n(8) Directive 90/642/EEC, as amended, as well as Directive 86/362/EEC, as amended provide for the adoption of actions to be taken at Community level in the case of reported infringements and for detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring.\n(9) A summary overview of the monitoring systems in all Member States is necessary to improve the monitoring of pesticide residues in the Community and to assist in its proper functioning.\n(10) Detailed implementing rules necessary for the proper functioning of the monitoring provisions should be made. These rules should clearly set out the actions to, and procedures by, which the Commission may make financial contributions, within the available budgetary allocations.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["1.
