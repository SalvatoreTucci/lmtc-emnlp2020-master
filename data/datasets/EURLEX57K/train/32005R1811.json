Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74 252) was provisionally authorised for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 937/2001\u00a0(5) and for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2188/2002\u00a0(6) and was authorised without a time-limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004\u00a0(7) and for turkey for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005\u00a0(8). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years.\n(8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 529.94) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 526.94) for chickens for fattening and for turkeys for fattening. EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years.\n(9) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC\u00a0Sc\u00a047) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for dairy cows by Regulation (EC) No 937/2001. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(10) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS\u00a0493.94) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for dairy cows by Regulation (EC) No 937/2001. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(11) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(9).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex I, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, are authorised for use for four years as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex III, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
