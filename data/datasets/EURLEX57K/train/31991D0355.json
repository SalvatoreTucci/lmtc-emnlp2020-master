Consequently, pursuant to Article 10 of the Decision, the Commission  must determine whether the measure is compatible with the objectives and criteria laid down in the  Decision and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThe measures to rationalize and restructure the French coal industry which were necessary because  some pits were not economically viable in the long term, have led since 1986 to a 40  % reduction  in coal production and a marked improvement in both productivity and production costs. The  restructuring programme involves the concentration of production in Lorraine in the pits most  likely to be economically viable and the subsequent closure of underground mines in the Centre-Midi  coalfield. As part of the restructuring, modernization and rationalization process, production  capacity in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais coalfield was closed at the end of 1990.\nThe aid granted to the French coal industry has been substantially reduced. The amount of aid  notified for 1991 will represent no more than 32  % of the aid granted in 1986.\nAid to cover operating losses facilitates rationalization and restructuring of the coal industry  and thus improves the industry's competitiveness in the long term.\nThe proposed aid will cover only 52  % of the difference for each tonne produced between  foreseeable average costs and foreseeable average returns, and therefore meets the criteria laid  down in Article 3 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.\nSince the measure contributes to the restructuring and rationalization of the industry and in view  of its purpose, it satisfies the objectives and conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Decision.\nConsequently, the aid to current production which the French Government plans to grant to the coal  industry in 1991, pursuant to Article 3 of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, is compatible with the proper  functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision does not affect the compatibility with the Treaties of arrangements governing sales  of coal mined in France to electricity producers,", "main_body": ["France is hereby authorized to grant to  the coal industry for 1991: aid totalling FF 1  153  000  000 to cover operating losses.", "France shall inform the Commission no later than 30 June 1992 of the amount of aid actually paid  in 1991.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at  Brussels, 29 April 1991.
