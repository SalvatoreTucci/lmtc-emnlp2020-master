Implementing rules should be laid down for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.\n(2) There should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quota for all interested traders within the Community. However, pursuant to Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the method of administration may give due weight to the supply requirements on the Community market.\n(3) The requirements of certain Member States which have a shortfall of bovine animals for fattening may therefore be taken into account. As those requirements are particularly evident in Italy and Greece, priority should be given to satisfying demand in those two Member States.\n(4) For the allocation of the tariff quota methods which have been applied in the past to this quota should be applied again. Consequently, in Italy and Greece the method referred to in the third indent of Article 32(2) should be applied while the method referred to in the second indent of that paragraph shall be used for applications in other Member States.\n(5) Importers who can show that they have been involved in trade with live animals with third countries should be able to apply for import rights. Proof of that involvement calls for evidence to be presented of recent import or export of some significance.\n(6) Checks of criteria for participation in the quota allocation call for applications to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is entered in the value added tax (VAT) register. Italy and Greece are an exception to this rule: traders entered in the VAT register of another Member State may submit their applications in these two countries.\n(7) In order to prevent speculation:\n- importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2002 should be denied access to the quota,\n- a security should be fixed for import rights,\n- licences should not be transferable,\n- import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(8) In order to provide for more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animal per application, each application should respect a maximum and a minimum number of heads.\n(9) To oblige traders to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that this obligation is a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(4).\n(10) With a view to using up quota quantities completely, a closing date should be set for the submission of import licence applications and provision should be made for a further allocation of quantities not covered by licence applications submitted by that date. In the light of experience it should also be laid down that this final allocation is open only to importers who have applied for import licences for the total quantity to which they are entitled.\n(11) A proper management of the quota requires the use of import licences. To that end, rules should be laid down in particular on the way applications are to be submitted and the information to be shown in applications and licences, where applicable by waiving or supplementing certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for certain agricultural products(5) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2442/2001(7).\n(12) A proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(13) With a view of ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply.\n(14) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of the imported animals. The animals should therefore be fattened in the Member State which has issued the import licence.\n(15) A security must be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for home use of the animals in question.\n(16) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not given an opinion within the time limit set by its President,", "main_body": ["1. A tariff quota for 169000 young male bovine animals covered by CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 29 or 0102 90 49 and intended for fattening in the Community is hereby opened for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.\nThe serial number of the quota shall be 09.4005.\n2.

It must be lodged with the competent authority together with the application for import rights.\n2. Import licence applications must be submitted for the import rights allocated.
