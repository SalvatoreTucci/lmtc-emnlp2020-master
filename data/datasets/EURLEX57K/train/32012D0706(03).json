The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation.\n(2) The Council conclusions on common values and principles in European Union health systems\u00a0(1), adopted in June 2006, recognise that while it is not appropriate to try to standardise health systems at an EU level, there is immense value in work at a European level on health care. Member States have therefore committed themselves to working together to share experiences and information about good practices.\n(3) The Decision No 1350/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-13)\u00a0(2) (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the health programme\u2019), while reiterating, in accordance with Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that health services are primarily the responsibility of Member States, stresses that cooperation at Community level can benefit both patients and health systems. According to Article 2 of this Decision, read in conjunction with points 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the Annex, one of the objectives of the health programme is to generate and disseminate health information and knowledge by providing analysis and technical assistance in support of policy makers in the development and implementation of legislation related to the scope of the programme.\n(4) The Council conclusions \u2018Towards modern, responsive and sustainable health systems\u2019, adopted on 6 June 2011\u00a0(3), invite the Commission and Member States to initiate a reflection process aiming to identify effective ways of investing in health, and the Commission to support the reflection process by facilitating the access to independent and multisectoral expert advice.\n(5) The Council Working Party on Public Health, meeting at senior level, established a forum for cooperation on effective ways of investing in health, and endorsed the creation of working groups on different topics, such as: enhancing the adequate representation of health in Europe 2020 and in the European Semester, defining success factors for the effective use of Structural Funds for health investments, cost-effective use of medicines, integrated care models and better hospital management, measuring and monitoring the effectiveness of health investments.\n(6) The Commission is participating in all these sub-groups with a view to support Member States' cooperation on health systems and to assist it through provision of information and knowledge.\n(7) Sound and timely scientific advice is an essential requirement for Commission's provision of information and knowledge relating to sustainability of healthcare systems. It must be based on the principles of excellence, independence, multisectoral approach and transparency.\n(8) In that context, it is appropriate to establish an expert group which will support the Commission, by providing independent and sound advice on effective ways of investing in health.\n(9) The expert group should be composed of experienced and knowledgeable persons coming from the public or private sector, as well as from civil society. It is essential that the expert panel make best use of scientific expertise in the EU and beyond as may be necessary for a specific question.\n(10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be laid down.\n(11) Personal data should be collected, processed and published in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4).\n(12) A system of indemnities should be put in place in order to ensure that experts with appropriate competences participate in the group, in representation of civil society, public and private sector.\n(13) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nAn expert group on effective ways of investing in health (hereinafter \u2018the panel\u2019) is hereby established.", "Mission\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mission of the panel shall be to provide the Commission, upon its request, with independent and multisectoral advice on effective ways of investing in health in the fields of expertise set out in Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Advice provided by the panel shall take account of the work of other Union bodies concerned with the sustainability of health systems, such as the Economic Policy Committee and the Social Protection Committee.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission will circulate advice from the panel to the Member States indicating interest.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The advice will remain informal and will in no circumstances be binding.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The panel shall be composed of a maximum of 17 members.
