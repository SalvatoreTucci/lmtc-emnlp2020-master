Preparation of the test sample:\nWarm the laboratory sample in the closed glass or suitable plastic container, which should be from one-half to two-thirds full, to a temperature at which the sample will be soft enough to facilitate thorough mixing to a homogeneous state (either by a mechanical shaker or by hand). The temperature of mixing should normally not exceed 35 \u00b0C. Cool the sample to ambient temperature. As soon as possible after cooling open the sample container and stir briefly (not longer than 10 seconds) with a suitable device, for example a spoon or spatula, before weighing.\n7.2.

Test report\nThe test report shall specify the method used and the results obtained. It shall also mention all operating details not specified in this international standard or regarded as optional, together with details of any incidents which may have influenced the results. The test report shall include all information necessary for the complete identification of the sample.\nANNEX II\nBUTTER: DETERMINATION OF SOLIDS-NON-FAT CONTENT\n1. Scope and field of application\nThis standard specifies a method for the determination of the solids-non-fat content of butter.\n2.

Definitions\nSolids-non-fat content of butter: The percentage by mass of substances as determined by the procedure specified. It is expressed in grams per 100 grams.\n4. Principle\nEvaporation of water from a known mass of butter, extraction of the fat with light petroleum and weighing of the residue.\n5.

Preparation of the test sample\nWarm the laboratory sample in the closed glass or suitable plastic container, which should be from one-half to two-thirds full, to a temperature at which the sample will be soft enough to facilitate thorough mixing to a homogeneous state (either by a mechanical shaker or by hand). The temperature of mixing should normally not exceed 35 \u00b0C. Cool the sample to ambient temperature. As soon as possible after cooling open the sample container and stir briefly (not longer than 10 seconds) with a suitable device, for example a spoon or spatula, before weighing.\n8.2. Determination8.2.1. Dry the dish with the rod (6.4) and the crucible (6.5) in the oven (6.3) for 1 hour. Allow these objects to cool in the desiccator and weigh them together (i.e. dish, rod and crucible) to the nearest 1 mg (m0).\nNotes: - As a rule, a cooling time of 45 minutes is sufficient,\n- It is important that the same combination of dish, rod and crucible is used for each test portion if more than one test portion is being analysed in the batch.\n8.2.2. Remove the crucible, record the weight of the dish and rod together, to the nearest 1 mg (m1).\n8.2.3. Weigh into the dish, to the nearest 1 mg, a test portion of about 5g of the test sample (8.1) (m2).\n8.2.4. Place the dish (containing the rod and the butter) in the oven at 102 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and leave it overnight.\n8.2.5. Allow the dish (8.2.3) to cool to room temperature.\n8.2.6. Add 15 ml of warm (approximately 25 \u00b0C) light petroleum to the dish and detach as much as possible of the sediment adhering to the dish using the glass rod. Transfer the solvent into the crucible and allow it to filter in the suction flask.\n8.2.7. Carry out operation 8.2.6 four additional times. If there are no traces of fat on the surface of the dish, quantitatively transfer, during the fourth washing, as much as possible of the sediment into the crucible. Otherwise, repeat operation 8.2.6 till complete elimination of all traces of fat.\n8.2.8. Wash the sediment in the crucible with 25 ml of warm light petroleum.\n8.2.9. Dry the dish and the glass rod, and the crucible together in the oven at 102 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C for 30 minutes.\n8.2.10. Allow to cool in the desiccator to room temperature and weigh to the nearest 1 mg.\n8.2.11. Repeat operations 8.2.9 and 8.2.10 until constant mass (mass change not exceeding 1 mg) is reached for the dish, rod and crucible together (m3).\n9. Expression of results\n9.1. Calculation of solids-non-fat content\nCalculate the solids-non-fat content SNF, as a percentage by mass, using the following formula:\nSNF = >NUM>m3 - m0\n>DEN>m2 - m1\n\u00d7 100\nwhere\nm0 is the mass, in grams, of the empty dish with the glass rod and the crucible (8.2.1)\nm1 is the mass, in grams, of the empty dish with the glass rod (8.2.2)\nm2 is the mass, in grams, of the test portion and dish with the glass rod (8.2.3)\nm3 is the final mass, in grams, in the dish with the rod and the crucible containing sediment (8.2.11)\nReport the result to the first decimal place.\n9.2. Repeatability\nThe absolute difference between the results of two single determinations, carried out simultaneously or in rapid succession by the same operator under the same conditions on identical test material, shall not exceed 0,1 %.\n9.3. Reproducibility\nThe absolute difference between two single and independent results, obtained by two operators working in different laboratories on identical test material, shall not exceed 0,2 %.\n10. Test report\nThe test report shall specify the method used and the results obtained. It shall also mention all operating details not specified in this international standard, or regarded as optional, together with details of any incidents which may have influenced the results. The test report shall include all information necessary for the complete identification of the sample.\nNote:\nIf salted butter is analysed, added salt is determined as solids-non-fat. For the determination of the milk solids-non-fat content, the content of added salt has to be subtracted from the solids-non-fat content. The calculated precision figures for the determination of milk solids-non-fat are:\n>TABLE>\nIt can be concluded that the precision figures obtained for the solids-non-fat determination are valid for the determination of the milk solids-non-fat content.\nANNEX III\nDETERMINATION OF THE FAT CONTENT OF BUTTER\nThe fat content is obtained indirectly by determination of the water content and the solids-non-fat content according to Annex I and Annex II, respectively. The percentage, by mass, of fat is equal to\n100 - (W + SNF)\nwhere\nW: is the percentage, by mass, of water\nSNF: is the percentage, by mass, of solids-non-fat\nThe calculated precision figures for the determination of the fat content are:\n>TABLE>"}
