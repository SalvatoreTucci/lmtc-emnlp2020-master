JUPP\u00c9\nANNEX\n1.  When this Regulation comes into force, Portugal will submit to the Commission a  detailed proposal for a programme.\nThis programme will be examined by the Commission with a view to a decision to approve it.\nThis examination will assess in particular the existence of a strategy of adaptation for the  textile and clothing industry for the period 1995 to 1999, the approval of which by the Commission  is a condition for the granting of Community assistance under the present programme. The strategy  will also define rules governing aid for undertakings, in particular as regards compliance with the  requirement that there is to be no overall increase in Portuguese production capacity in the  textile and clothing industry in terms of volume.\nI.  ELIGIBLE MEASURES\n2.  The measures cover undertakings in the textile and clothing  sector situated on Portuguese territory on 1 July 1994. The programme submitted by the Portuguese  authorities must comprise a balanced set of measures consistent with the general framework of  regional development in Portugal and the overall strategy for the adaptation of the textile and  clothing sector, centring on the preparation and implementation of individual modernization plans  of undertakings in the sector, the development of cooperation between undertakings, and an  improvement in their environment in terms of services.\nEligible measures may cover:\n(a)  aid for the financing of external expert reports intended to assist undertakings in preparing  their modernization plans and improving their know-how, for example, in the fields of design,  quality policy, computer-assisted design and production, marketing, internal business organiaztion  and employee health and safety;\n(b)  vocational training measures linked to the preparation and implementation of modernization  plans and retraining for personnel threatened by unemployment or already unemployed;\n(c)  in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises which already have a modernization plan  drawn up with the aid of external experts, a temporary contribution towards the financing of the  salaries of engineers, technicians or management personnel employed to assist in the implementation  of those plans;\n(d)  the financing of business modernization plans to cover non-material investments, improvements  in know-how or material investments, including equipment intended directly for production;\ninvestments in production equipment will be promoted only by means of providing access for  undertakings to risk capital, by means of loans from the EIB or other financial bodies with  interest subsidies and by means of guarantee funds;\n(e)  the setting up of promotion and advisory teams for the textile and clothing sector responsible  for making businesses more aware of the need to improve their know-how and helping them to develop  cooperation amongst themselves and with their suppliers and clients;\n(f)  aid for the adaptation of textile and clothing undertakings, in particular to Community  environmental requirements, intended to reduce pollution by textile and clothing undertakings by  facilitating the treatment and recycling of liquid effluents and industrial waste, and by providing  technical assistance for the development of less polluting production or maintenance processes.\nII.  CONDITIONS FOR GRANTING COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE\n3.  When each decision on the  financing of business modernization plans is taken, the Portuguese authorities, who are responsible  for laying down rules governing the aid, must verify that the plans are consistent with the overall  adaptation strategy agreed with the Commission. They must make the grant of aid conditional upon  subsequent compliance with the agreed plan. The necessary provisions governing the examination of  aid applciations, monitoring the implementation of the adaptation plans and the penalties to be  applied in the event of failure to comply with the conditions for aid, shall be determined by joint  agreement between the Portuguese authorities and the Commission of the European Communities.\nInvestment projects financed under this programme are part of the framework of existing horizontal  aid schemes in Portugal. Thus, the projects must meet the eligibility criteria laid down for those  schemes. Therefore, no specific aid scheme will be establihsed for the textile and clothing  sector.\nUndertakings receiving aid will have to prove that they comply with national legislation on working  conditions.\nIII.  IMPLEMENTATION\n4.  Every six months the Commission and the Portuguese  authorities will check for compliance with the overall strategy agreed with the Commission, within  the appropriate monitoring committee, on the basis of reports on the progress of programme  implementation and, where appropriate, independent assessments.\n5.  The regional and local authorities and the social partners must be involved in the most  appropriate manner in the preparation and implementation of the programme.\n6.  The proposal must include an assessment of the situation and indicate the objectives to be  attained; it will be accompanied by a timetable and criteria and procedures for implementation,  monitoring and assessment. During and after the period coverd by the programme the Commission will  assess, in partnership with Portugal, the results of the programmes submitted. The European  Parliament, the Member States and the monitoring committee will be informed of the results of such  assessments and the action taken in response to them.\n7.  Spending arising under this programme will be eligible from 1 January 1995."}
