However, for the 2004/2005 import season, the entry into the Community of such tubers is permitted from \u2018pest-free areas\u2019 and subject to specific conditions.\n(2) During the 2004/2005 import season, a number of interceptions of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith were recorded resulting in a prohibition on all exports of Egyptian potatoes to the Community as of 6 April 2005.\n(3) Egypt has submitted a report into the causes of these interceptions. The main finding is that stricter measures need to be taken as regards producers, inspectors, exporters and packing stations failing to follow their instructions regarding the export of potatoes destined for the Community. Certain measures have already been taken in Egypt.\n(4) It is appropriate to lay down at Community level requirements to ensure the effectiveness of inspections and controls carried out in Egypt on potatoes at the packing station and the port of dispatch prior to export to the Community.\n(5) In the light of the information provided by Egypt, the Commission has established that there is no risk of spreading Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith with the entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. from pest-free areas of Egypt, provided that certain conditions are satisfied.\n(6) The entry into the Community of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L. originating in pest-free areas of Egypt should therefore be permitted for the 2005/2006 import season subject to specified conditions.\n(7) Decision 2004/4/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/4/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
