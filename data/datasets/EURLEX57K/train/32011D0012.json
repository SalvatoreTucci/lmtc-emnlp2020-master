The Review Panel suggested a number of adjustments in order to ensure a more effective European Research Council and a coherent presentation of the ERC\u2019s activities to stakeholders.\n(3) On the basis of the review and the ambition to make the ERC fully sustainable, the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: \u2018The European Research Council \u2014 meeting the challenge of world class excellence\u2019\u00a0(4), sets out the aims for the second phase of the ERC\u2019s development. It includes a number of specific actions to improve the ERC\u2019s operations to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the \u2018Ideas\u2019 Specific Programme.\n(4) In accordance with that Communication, it is necessary to ensure a single clear and transparent vision and seamless liaison between the ERC\u2019s strategy and operational implementation, reflecting the activities of both the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA), established by Commission Decision 2008/37/EC\u00a0(5) and the Scientific Council, and to develop and implement a coherent and integrated communication strategy.\n(5) In order to recognise the personal commitment of the members of the Scientific Council, and especially the Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, it is appropriate to introduce an honorarium for their attendance at the Scientific Council plenary meetings. The honorarium should reflect their responsibilities and be benchmarked against similar provisions in similar entities and Member States. It is also appropriate to provide for the financing of a standing Identification Committee for the identification of future Scientific Council members.\n(6) It is necessary to continue the arrangements for the local support to the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairpersons of the Scientific Council, using the \u2018Coordination and Support Action\u2019 grant funding scheme of the Seventh Framework Programme.\n(7) The term of office of the founding members of the Scientific Council expires on 1 February 2011 and there is a need for the staged renewal of the Scientific Council, as provided for in Article 4(6) of Decision 2007/134/EC. The identification of new members was carried out by means of an independent Identification Committee and in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(4) of Decision 2007/134/EC, including a report to Parliament and Council. This Committee made recommendations for the staged renewal of the Scientific Council and these recommendations have been accepted.\n(8) Decision 2007/134/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/134/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
