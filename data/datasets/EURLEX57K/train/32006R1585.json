For the 2006/2007 marketing year those quotas must be adjusted by 30 September 2006.\n(2) The adjustments result in particular from the application of Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, which provide for the allocation of additional sugar quotas and additional and supplementary isoglucose quotas. The adjustments must take account of the communications from the Member States provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system\u00a0(2) relating in particular to the additional and supplementary quotas already allocated on the date on which the communication is drawn up.\n(3) The adjustments to the quotas in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 also result from the application of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3), which provides for restructuring aid for undertakings which renounce their quotas. It is therefore necessary to take account of the renounced quotas in accordance with the Communication from the Commission (2006/C 234/04) of 29 September 2006 on the estimated availability of financial resources for granting of restructuring aid for the 2006/2007 marketing year\u00a0(4).\n(4) The adjustment of the quotas laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is without prejudice to the conditions governing the grant of the aid provided for in Chapter 10f of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and modifying Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) 1452/2001, (EC) 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001\u00a0(5) and in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006.\n(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 1.7.2006, p. 39.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 42.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 234, 29.9.2006, p. 9.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
