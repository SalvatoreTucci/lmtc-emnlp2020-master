whereas it would therefore appear justifiable, in the interest of certainty as to the law, to have recourse in addition to Article 235 of the Treaty;\nWhereas the Council has already agreed on Community action in this field through its resolution of 2 June 1983 concerning vocational training measures and new information technologies (5) as well as through the resolution of the Council and of the Ministers for Education, meeting within the Council, of 19 September 1983 on measures relating to the introduction of new information technology in education (6);\nWhereas the Council in its conclusions of 7 June 1984 on technological change and social adjustment (7) requested the Commission to develop, and where necessary, to initiate, work with the purpose of strengthening cooperation between industry and training institutions, in particular advanced training institutions with a view to improving the provision of initial training and the imparting of new skills to those whose employment is affected by technological innovations;\nWhereas the Council has adopted measures with a view to strengthening technological cooperation at Community level, in particular with its Decisions 85/141/EEC (8), 85/195/EEC (9), 85/196/EEC (10) and 85/197/EEC (11) concerning ESPRIT, Biotechnology, BRITE and the plan to stimulate European scientific and technical cooperation and interchange;\nWhereas the European Council, at its meeting in March 1985, reiterated the importance of strengthening the technological base and competitiveness of industry and, in that context, emphasized the necessity to make better use of human resources, in particular by means of increased cooperation between higher education and industry;\nWhereas at its meeting on 3 June 1985 the Council and the Ministers for Education, meeting within the Council, exchanged views on objectives for joint action in this field;\nWhereas on 24 May 1983 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the competitiveness of Community industry (1) in which it called for efforts to be made in vocational training and training for managers of undertakings; whereas that resolution complements the resolution concerning measures of vocational training relating to the introduction of new information technologies (2) and the other resolutions, notably those rela-  ting to higher education and the development of cooperation between higher-education institutions (3) and on the Community research and development programme in the field of information technologies (4) and on a plan to stimulate European cooperation and scientific and technical interchange (5);\nWhereas on 3 June 1985 the Council adopted the resolution on equal opportunities for girls and boys in education and training (6); whereas on that basis, the development, at Community level of a human resources strategy must involve representatives of both sexes;\nWhereas the exploitation of technological developments throughout industry will depend on the versatility, skills and enterprise of the workforce; whereas, in this context, there is an urgent need to develop, at Community level, appropriate Community policies as a complement to an overall Community strategy for industrial research and development and innovation policies;\nWhereas cooperation between university and enterprise in the field of training must be developed both within Member States, particularly at local and regional level, and be assisted by Community measures involving, as far as possible, existing bodies in the Member States,\nAfter wide-ranging consultations on the subject organized by the Commission, and having regard in particular to the opinion of the Advisory Committee for Vocational  Training,", "main_body": ["A programme designed to strengthen and to stimulate intra-Community cooperation between universities and enterprises regarding training, including ongoing training, in the field of technology, hereinafter referred to as the 'COMETT programme', is hereby adopted for a four-year period commencing on 1 January 1986.\nThe COMETT programme shall consist of two phases: a preparatory phase (1986) and an operational phase (1987 to 1989).\nThe detailed arrangements for the COMETT programme are contained in the Annex.", "For the purposes of the COMETT programme:\n- the term 'university' is used in its general sense to indicate all types of post-secondary education and training establishments which offer, where appropriate within the framework of advanced training, qualifications or diplomas of that level, whatever such establishments may be called in the Member States,\n- the term 'enterprise' is used to indicate all types of economic activity, including both large and small and medium-sized undertakings, whatever their legal status or the manner of applying new technologies.", "The objectives of the COMETT programme shall be as follows:\n(a) to give a European dimension to cooperation between universities and enterprises in training relating to innovation and the development and application of new technologies;\n(b) to foster the joint development of training programmes and the exchange of experience, and also the optimum use of training resources at Community level;\n(c) to improve the supply of training at local, regional and national level with the assistance of the authorities concerned, thus contributing to the balanced economic development of the Community;\n(d) to develop the level of training in response to technological change and social changes by identifying the resulting priorities in existing training arrangements which call for supplementary action both within Member States and at Community level, and by promoting equal opportunities for men and women.", "The funds estimated as necessary for the implementation of the COMETT programme amount to 45 million ECU.

Within a period of two months after the programme has been communicated for the second time, the Commission shall take a final decision, except in cases where - in respect of the topics referred to in point (a) above - a qualified majority of representatives of the Member States asks for the matter to be referred to the Council. In that event, the Council may adopt a different position within two months. In the absence of such a Council decision, the Commission shall take a final decision.\n5. An annual report regarding the implementation of the COMETT programme shall be submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training set up under Decision 63/266/EEC and also to the Education Committee set up pursuant to the resolution of the Council and the Minsiters for Education, meeting within the Council, of 9 February 1976 (1).\n6.

Within the framework of the COMETT programme the projects which are to receive Community assistance will be chosen on the basis of, in particular, their stimulative and exemplary character, and their contribution to strengthening a European sense of identity and to intensifying cooperation between universities and enterprises with regard to training.\nThe choice will be made regardless of the involvement of the undertakings concerned in Community research and development projects and it shall take particular account of the training requirements of small and medium-sized undertakings.\n3.
