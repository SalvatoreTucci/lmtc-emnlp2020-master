Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (OJ No L  349, 31. 12. 1994, p. 105).\nANNEX\nDEFINITION OF GRAIN AND BROKEN GRAINS WHICH ARE NOT OF UNIMPAIRED QUALITY\nA.  Whole grains:\ngrains from which only part of the end has been removed, irrespective of characteristics produced  at each stage of milling.\nB. Clipped grains:\ngrains from which the entire end has been removed.\nC. Broken grains or broken rice:\ngrains from which a part of the volume greater than the end has been removed. Broken grains  include:\n- large broken grains (pieces of grain of a length not less than half that of a grain, but not  constituting a complete grain),\n- medium broken grains (pieces of grain of a length not less than a quarter of the length of a  grain but which are smaller than the minimum size of 'large broken grains'),\n- fine broken grains (pieces of grain less than a quarter of the size of a grain but too large to  pass through a sieve with a mesh of 1,4 mm),\n- fragments (small pieces or particles of grain which can pass through a sieve with a mesh of 1,4  mm); split grains (pieces produced by a longitudinal split in the grain) come under this  definition.\nD. Green grains:\ngrains which are not fully ripened.\nE. Grains showing natural malformation:\nnatural malformation means malformation, whether or not of hereditary origin, as compared with the  morphological characteristics typical of the variety.\nF. Chalky grains:\ngrains at least three-quarters of the surface of which looks opaque and chalky.\nG. Grains striated with red:\ngrains showing longitudinal red striations of differing intensity and shades, due to residues from  the pericarp.\nH. Spotted grains:\ngrains showing a well-defined small circle of dark colour of more or less regular shape; spotted  grains also include those which show slight black striations on the surface only; the striations  and spots must not show a yellow or dark aureole.\nI. Stained grains:\ngrains which have undergone, on a small area of their surface, an obvious change in their natural  colour; the stains may be of different colours (blackish, reddish, brown); deep black striations  are also to be regarded as stains. If the colour of the stains is sufficiently marked (black, pink,  reddish-brown) to be immediately visible and if they cover an area not less than half that of the  grain, the grains must be considered to be yellow grains.\nJ. Yellow grains:\nyellow grains are those which have undergone, totally or partially, otherwise than by drying, a  change in their natural colour and have taken on a lemon or orange-yellow tone.\nK. Amber grains:\namber grains are those which have undergone, otherwise than by drying, a slight uniform change in  colour over the whole surface; this change alters the colour of the grains to a light  amber-yellow."}
