In order to avoid this situation and to ensure that the tendering process covered by Regulation (EC) No 990/2006 works effectively, the security for rye should be increased.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 990/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 990/2006 is hereby replaced by the following text:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding Article 17(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, the obligation to export shall be covered by a security equal to the difference between the intervention price applying on the day of the award and the price awarded, but not less than EUR 50 per tonne for rye and EUR 25 per tonne in the case of other cereals.
