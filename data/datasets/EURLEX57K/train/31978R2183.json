From 1 January 1979, the railway undertakings shall calculate the costs of the freight transport referred to in Article 1 in accordance with the following general principle.\n\"Costs\" shall be the change in the total costs of the railway undertaking resulting from the introduction of new traffic, from an increase or a reduction in existing traffic or from the termination of such traffic. \"Change\" means:    - for new traffic or for an increased volume of existing traffic, the additional costs to the railway undertaking resulting from the acceptance of such traffic,\n- for existing traffic the termination of which is being considered or for a reduction in volume of existing traffic, the savings in costs resulting from the termination or reduction of such traffic.\n2. In addition to the calculation of costs in accordance with the general principle set out in paragraph 1, the railway undertakings shall calculate the total costs defined in Annex IV, provided however, either that the railway undertaking uses them for the railway activities covered by this Regulation or that there is agreement with the other railway undertakings participating in the same traffic that they should be calculated.", "1. Costs shall be calculated for the same period as the expected duration of the traffic being costed and taking into account the economic conditions forecast for that period.\n2. Costs shall be calculated with reference to the standard list in Annex I, on the basis of the guidelines in Annex II and taking into account the various traffic characteristics of which an indicative list is given in Annex III.\n3. For the purpose of calculating costs, railway undertakings may use the standard bases for cost calculation defined in Annex IV.", "Within the limits of their commercial responsibility, railway undertakings participating in international freight transport as defined in Article 1 shall communicate to the other railway undertakings participating in the same traffic, on a basis of reciprocity, at the latter's request and in confidence, the information referred to in Article 3 and shall indicate the bases used for the calculation.", "1.

(1)OJ No L 334, 24.12.1977, p. 13.\nANNEX II Guidelines for implementing the principles laid down in Article 3\nThe costs itemized in Annex I shall be calculated in accordance with the following guidelines:    1. Costing shall as far as possible take into account:      - the characteristics of the traffic in question and all movements and operations associated with such traffic,\n- the context in which costing is to take place (and in particular the degree of saturation of the capacity of installations).\n2. Costing shall be done taking into account the resources committed to take account of the variation of traffic under consideration and in particular:      - whether the resources exist specifically for the traffic in question or in any case for other types of traffic,\n- the circumstances in which the resources may have to be modified,\n- the extent to which changes in staff and rolling stock are required.\n3. Consideration shall be given as far as possible to the fact that the circumstances in which the traffic is moved may change during the period under review.\nANNEX III Indicative list of the traffic characteristics and the specific data of each railway undertaking concerned to be considered in calculating costs\nI. General traffic characteristics     - nature and volume of traffic to be conveyed,\n- kind of traffic : regular, seasonal, or occasional,\n- frequency and duration of the transport,\n- forwarding and destination stations of the consignment,\n- route followed by the traffic and by any wagons returning empty,\n- class of service,\n- number of wagons per train,\n- category, type and characteristics of wagons used : railway or privately-owned - covered, open, flat, etc. - tare weight, length, etc.,\n- weight of consignment and average load of wagons,\n- return factor and factor for empty wagons.\nII. Specific data of the railway undertakings participating in the traffic     - distances run on railway lines owned by the undertaking (loaded or empty),\n- turn-round times of wagons,\n- shunting of loaded traffic and, where applicable, of empty return wagons (on departure, on arrival, during journey),\n- for each part of the line:    - distance run,\n- capacity of the line on account of the gradients,\n- category of the line used by the traffic with reference to the maintenance cycle,\n- traction units used (method, class),\n- distances run by traction units (including assisted journeys and distances run light),\n- gross trailing tonnage of trains (authorized and actual weight),\n- rostered hours of staff (driving, manning, etc.).\nANNEX IV Standard bases for cost calculation\nFor the purpose of calculating costs in accordance with Article 3, railway undertakings may, as appropriate, use the following bases, which should be indicated in the cost communication referred to in Article 5:\nFor the cost calculation referred to in Article 3 (1):    - variable costs, i.e. all the costs which vary with the number of activities carried out or of services rendered,\n- direct costs, i.e. all the costs which may be allocated directly without applying allocation formulae to an activity or group of activities or to a service or group of services,\n- avoidable costs, i.e. costs which would be avoided if the service or activity being costed did not exist.\nFor the cost calculation referred to in Article 3 (2):\nTotal costs : all the costs of the undertaking should be allocated among its various activities, using where necessary formulae relating to those activities, so that the total costs for the relevant period are fully taken into account.\nTotal costs for the relevant period should be taken to mean the costs by type as shown in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2830/77 after deduction of compensation received for the purpose of normalizing accounts and of payments which are expressly defined in Community Regulations on transport aid as \"aid\" and cannot be equated with revenue, provided that networks which make no such deductions in the field of cost calculation indicate this fact in the communication referred to in Article 5."}
