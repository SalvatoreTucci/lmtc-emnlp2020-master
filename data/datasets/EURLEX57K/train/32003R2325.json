Consequently, more than 400 fishing vessels and about 4300 fishermen operating in that context were forced to stop their fishing activities at that date.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001(3) introduced derogations from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999(4) for shipowners and fishermen who were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, applicable to certain types of premiums and public aid granted by administrative decision between 1 July 2001 and 30 June 2003. The same Regulation introduced a specific action to supplement the measures taken in the context of Structural Fund assistance in the Member States concerned due to the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.\n(3) The fishermen affected by the non-renewal of that fisheries agreement may find themselves unemployed following conversion of their vessel to another activity in the same way as fishermen whose vessel has permanently stopped its activity. In order to ensure that all fishermen are treated equally, the provisions stipulating that individual lump sums may be paid to fishermen only provided the fishing vessel on which they were employed has permanently stopped its activities should be derogated from.\n(4) The minimum period of less than one year referred to in Article 12(4)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 during which the fisherman may not work as a fisherman again without being required to pay back the premium received pro rata temporis should be calculated from 1 January 2002, the date from which temporary cessation payments may no longer be paid, and not from the date on which the premium was actually paid.\n(5) In view of the deadlines currently in force, in order to be able to apply the abovementioned amendments, the time limits for the date of the administrative decision, the final date for eligibility of expenditure and the final date for presenting the request for payment of the balance should all be extended by 12 months,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
