Commission of the individual quota allocated to their vessels over 24 metres and, for catching vessels less than 24 metres and for traps, at least of the quota allocated to producer organisations or

45\u00b0\u00a0W, and the Mediterranean Sea allocated to traps and longliners flying the flag of or registered in Italy are deemed to have been exhausted.\n(6) On 20 June 2012 Italy informed the
