Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is currently included in that list.\n(3) In May 2013 the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) amended Chapter 10.5. of the Aquatic Animal Health Code (OIE Aquatic Code) as regards ISA. According to the revised OIE Aquatic Code (16th Edition 2013), ISA is defined as an infection with genotype HPR-deleted or genotype HPR0 (non-deleted highly polymorphic region) of the genus Isavirus (ISAV) of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Furthermore, both genotypes are now notifiable in accordance with Article 1.3.1. and 10.5.1 of the OIE Aquatic Code. Before that revision no distinction was made between the two genotypes of ISAV.\n(4) Only infections with genotype HPR-deleted of the genus ISAV fulfil the criteria set out in Section B of Part I of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC. Consequently, only infections with genotype HPR-deleted of the genus ISAV should be listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC. For the purpose of Directive 2006/88/EC, infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) should therefore be defined as an infection with genotype HPR-deleted of the genus ISAV.\n(5) Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 15 November 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
