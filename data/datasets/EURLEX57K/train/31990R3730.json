whereas, to keep this  arrangement, it is fitting to open the quota in question for the period 1 January to 30 June 1991  with the consequence that the quotas by applying the pro rata clause, must be fixed respectively at  146 500 tonnes and 7 100 tonnes;\nWhereas, furthermore, tariff dismantling for melons will begin only on 1 January 1991, namely two  months after the beginning of the quota period; whereas therefore it is appropriate to open the  tariff quota in question for an amount which, based on the pro rata clause, should be set at 6 785  tonnes;\nWhereas, within the limits of these tariff quotas, customs duties are to be phased out according to  the same timetables and at the same rates as laid down in Articles 75, 243 and 268 of the Act of  Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas, however, within the limits of these tariff quotas, Spain  and Portugal shall apply customs duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of  Council Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 4162/87 of 21 December 1987 laying down arrangements for Spain's and  Portugal's trade with Israel (2); whereas the Community tariff quotas in question should therefore  be opened for 1991;\nWhereas, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2573/90 of 5 September 1990 totally suspending  certain customs duties applicable by the Community of Ten to imports from Spain and Portugal (3),  the said duties are, as concerns the products referred to in Annex II to the Treaty, totally  suspended once they reach a level of 2 % or less; whereas the same rate of duty should be applied  to imports of the same products originating in Israel;\nWhereas all Community importers should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said quotas  and the duty rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the  products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas the necessary  measures should be taken to provide for effective Community management of the quotas, so that the  Member States may draw against the quotas such quantities as they\nmay need, corresponding to  actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member  States and the Commission;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of these quotas may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["The customs duties applicable to imports  into the Community of the products listed below originating in Israel shall be suspended during the  periods, at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas shown below:\n>TABLE>\nWithin the limits of these tariff quotas the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese  Republic shall apply customs duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of  Regulation (EEC) No 4162/87.", "The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be  managed\nby the Commission, which may take all appropriate administrative measures in order to  ensure efficient management thereof.", "Where an importer enters a product covered by this  Regulation under a declaration for free circulation in a Member State and applies to take advantage  of the preferential arrangements and that declaration is accepted by the customs authorities the  Member State concerned shall, by notifying the Commission, draw an amount corresponding to its  requirements from the quota volume.\nRequests for drawings, indicating the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be sent to  the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings shall be granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the  declaration of entry for free circulation, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn it shall return them to the corresponding quota  volume as soon as possible.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota volume, the balance  shall be allocated among applications pro rata.
