The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by the United Kingdom in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2008, the average ageing period for Scotch whisky in 2008 was eight years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Community has concluded agreements abolishing export refunds with certain third countries. Under the terms of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1670/2006, this should be taken into account in calculating the coefficients for 2009/2010.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1196/2008 of 2 December 2008 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Scotch whisky for the period 2008/2009\u00a0(3) has exhausted its effects, as it concerns the coefficients applicable for the year 2008/2009.
