Completing the single market in financial services is therefore a crucial part of the Lisbon economic reform process and essential for the EU's global competitiveness.\n(2) The White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 (White Paper)\u00a0(1) presents the European Commission's financial services policy priorities up to 2010. One of the objectives of the Commission\u2019s financial services policy is to implement, enforce and continuously evaluate the existing legislation and to apply rigorously the better regulation agenda to future initiatives.\n(3) The White Paper identifies various practical steps to understand better how Community law is applied in practice, and to ensure that the level of legal coherence that markets need is in fact being delivered in line with the Commission\u2019s better regulation agenda. Since the first sectoral consistency check will be in the securities field, it has been decided to set up a group of securities markets practitioners and experts to assist the Commission in analysing the main problems in this field. This necessarily involves studying the transposition and application of Community law at the national level, to understand better how Community law is applied in practice, and to ensure that the level of legal coherence that cross-border investment services and securities markets need is in fact being delivered.\n(4) In addition to the advice of practitioners on issues related to the legal evaluation of EU securities Directives, the Commission considers it important to receive the expert group\u2019s analysis on the economic impact of the EU securities Directives as well as their practical implementation and application in the Member States. Consequently, the expert group will also assist the Commission to prepare its reports on the application of various provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC\u00a0(2), Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC\u00a0(3), Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse)\u00a0(4) and Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC\u00a0(5). The expert group will also provide technical advice on the Commission's request on issues of contemporary relevance in the EU securities markets, such as credit rating agencies and financial analysts.\n(5) The expert group should be made up of persons having legal expertise or direct commercial experience in respect of the matters covered by the mandate. Provision shall be made for the participation of experts or observers from other expert groups or consumers/investors associations.\n(6) This Decision gives effect to the Commission's commitment in the White Paper to create the expert group, and defines procedures for its composition and methods of operation.\n(7) Considering that the duration of expert group\u2019s activities should be limited, the expert group will commence in 2006 and continue until the end of 2009 unless the Commission decides to prolong the mandate of the expert group,", "main_body": ["A European Securities Markets Expert Group hereinafter referred to as \u2018the group\u2019 is hereby set up by the Commission.", "Task\nThe group shall:\n\u2014 provide advice to the Commission for its analysis of the legal coherence of the EU framework and, where appropriate, its implementation in national law, by carrying out a sectoral consistency check of the EU securities directives, reading across the relevant law to identify \u2014 from the perspective of the regulated community and users of the securities markets \u2014 points of legal uncertainty in the legislative framework which impair the functioning of those markets;\n\u2014 assist the Commission by providing advice that will contribute to the Commission\u2019s reports on the application of various provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC, Directive 2003/71/EC and Directive 2004/109/EC and on the operation of Directive 2003/6/EC.
