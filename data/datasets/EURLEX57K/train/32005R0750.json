As well, the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions regarding the declaration of the origin of the goods in trade with non-members countries require the creation of a specific code for determining the Community origin of goods.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to draw up a new version of this nomenclature that takes into account those new items as well as changes affecting some codes.\n(5) It is preferable to provide for a transition period to allow certain Member States to adapt to the amendments made to the Community legislation regarding the end of the use of numerical codes; it is essential for purposes of simplification for this transition period to end when the provisions revising the rules on the Single Administrative Document come into force.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Statistics relating to the Trading of Goods with Non-Member Countries,", "main_body": ["The version valid from 1 June 2005 of the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States is set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 June 2005.\nHowever, the Member States may use the three-digit numeric codes also shown in the Annex to the Regulation until the provisions revising Annexes 37 and 38 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 come into force\u00a0(3).\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirely and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nJoaqu\u00edn ALMUNIA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 118, 25.5.1995, p. 10.
