Implementing rules should be laid down for the quota year 2004/05 starting on 1 July 2004.\n(2) The 2003/04 quota was managed in conformity with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 780/2003 of 7 May 2003 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 (1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004)\u00a0(2). That Regulation laid down, in particular, strict criteria for participation so as to avoid registration of fictitious operators. Moreover, reinforced rules on the use of the import licences concerned provided an obstacle towards speculative trade in licences.\n(3) The experience obtained from the application of those rules indicates, however, that the uniform application of the management rules in the various Member States could not be guaranteed and that the quota continued to be vulnerable to speculation among operators, in particular due to the method of allocation provided for under subquota II in Regulation (EC) No 780/2003. In order to avoid a continuation of that situation and to ensure efficient management it is appropriate to introduce a method of administration based on an import performance criterion ensuring that the quota will be allocated to professional operators able to import beef without undue speculation.\n(4) It is appropriate to determine a reference period for eligible imports which is long enough to provide for a representative performance while also sufficiently recent to reflect the latest development in trade.\n(5) Operators in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the new Member States\u2019) should be allowed to apply on the basis of imports from countries which for them were third countries until 30 April 2004.\n(6) For control reasons, applications for import rights should be submitted in the Member States where the operator is entered in the national VAT register.\n(7) In order to prevent speculation, a security relating to import rights should be fixed for each applicant under the quota.\n(8) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be established that such obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agriculture products\u00a0(3).\n(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(5) should be applicable to import licences issued according to this Regulation, save where derogations are appropriate.\n(10) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not given an opinion within the time limit set by its President,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tariff quota totalling 53\u00a0000 tonnes expressed in weight of boneless meat is hereby opened for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005.\nThe order number of the tariff quota shall be 09.4003.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Common Custom Tariff duty applicable to the quota provided for in paragraph 1 shall be 20\u00a0% ad valorem.", "For the purposes of this Regulation,\na) 100 kilograms of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 77 kilograms of boneless meat;\nb) \u2018frozen meat\u2019 means meat that is frozen and has an internal temperature of -
