The salting process has been developed from a single step to a multi-step process, involving a pre-salting step which allows a shorter salting time and a relatively homogenous salt concentration in the fish muscle. For this, fish is first pre-salted by injection and/or brine salting with a prepared brine with a controlled salt concentration. After that fish is dry salted (i.e. curing) to get the right salt concentration in the end product.\n(6) During this long preservation oxidation can still occur, in particular of the lipids present in the fish muscle. This will lead to a change in colour and flavour. The oxidation is accelerated by the metal ions present in the fish muscle and used salt. Because they form chemical complexes with metals ions, diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) have been proven to be most effective to protect the salted fish against oxidation. Most of the added phosphates and the salt are removed by the soaking with water before consumption. The water content in the final wet salted product is not increased by this use of the phosphates. Salted fish of which the original colour and taste have been preserved is in particular demanded by the markets in Spain, Italy and Greece.\n(7) According to Article 3 in conjunction with Article 6(4) of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs\u00a0(3) the use of phosphates in wet salted fish, has to be labelled in the list of ingredients. Food business operators may also mark on their products that polyphosphates have not been used.\n(8) As most of the added phosphates are removed during the soaking with water, the exposure of the consumer to the phosphates will be minimal and is for that reason not liable to have an effect on human health. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) for the preservation of wet salted fish.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) for the preservation of wet salted fish constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(10) Bacalhau or Portuguese cod is produced by further drying wet salted fish. The use of polyphosphates could influence this drying process. In addition, this use could also hamper the development of the typical colour and taste of bacalhau. Salted fish that is treated with phosphates would therefore not be desired by the producers of traditional bacalhau. In order to allow the traditional bacalhau producers to adapt to the situation where fish treated with phosphates can be placed on the market a transitional period should be proposed. During this period the traditional bacalhau producers may make agreements with suppliers and become familiar with analytical methods that can be used for controlling the presence of added phosphates in the fish.\n(11) In order to further assess the impact on the availability of wet salted fish for the production of bacalhau, the Commission will, during three years, monitor the use of polyphosphates in the main salted cod producing countries.\n(12) Following the above, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entries are inserted in the food category 09.2 \u2018Processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans\u2019 after the entry for E 392:\n\u2018E 450 Diphosphates 5\u00a0000 (4), (79) only salted fish of the Gadidae family that have been pre-salted by injecting and/or brine salting with an at least 18\u00a0% salt solution and often followed by dry salting Period of application:\nE 451 Triphosphates 5\u00a0000 (4), (79) only salted fish of the Gadidae family that have been pre-salted by injecting and/or brine salting with an at least 18\u00a0% salt solution and often followed by dry salting Period of application:\nE 452 Polyphosphates 5\u00a0000 (4), (79) only salted fish of the Gadidae family that have been pre-salted by injecting and/or brine salting with an at least 18\u00a0% salt solution and often followed by dry salting Period of application:\n(4): The maximum level is expressed as P2O5\n(79): The maximum level applies to the sum of E 450, E 451 and E 452 used individually or in a combination\u2019"}
