The exemptions listed in the annex to this decision are granted on the basis of the results of a review process carried out by technical experts taking into account available evidence from studies, stakeholders and other scientific/technical sources. This review concluded that the elimination or substitution of the substances is still technically or scientifically impracticable.\n(3) Some exemptions from the prohibition for certain specific materials or components should be limited in their scope, in order to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, given that the use of those substances in such applications will become avoidable.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of Directive 2002/95/EC each exemption listed in the Annex must be subject to a review at least every four years or four years after an item is added to the list.\n(5) Directive 2002/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2002/95/EC, the Commission has consulted the relevant parties.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 19.
