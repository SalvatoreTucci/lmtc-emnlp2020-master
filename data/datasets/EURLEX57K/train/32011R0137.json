The substance is harmless for the environment and human health. Therefore to make it more easily available to farmers throughout the Union, calcium formate should be recognised as an \u2018EC fertiliser\u2019 type.\n(3) Provisions on micro-nutrient chelates and micro-nutrient solutions should be adapted to allow the use of more than one chelating agent, to introduce common values for the minimum content of water-soluble micro-nutrient and to ensure that each chelating agent that chelates at least 1\u00a0% of the water-soluble micro-nutrient and that is identified and quantified by EN standards is labelled. A sufficient transitional period is necessary in order to allow economic operators to sell off their stocks of fertilisers.\n(4) Zinc oxide powder (CAS 1314-13-2) is a zinc fertiliser listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. Zinc oxide in powder form presents a potential dust hazard in use. The use of zinc oxide in the form of a stable suspension in water avoids this hazard. Zinc fertiliser suspension should therefore be recognised as an \u2018EC fertiliser\u2019 type to allow a safer use of zinc oxide. To allow flexibility within formulations, the use of zinc salts and one or more types of zinc chelate(s) should also be permitted in any such water-based suspensions.\n(5) Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 contains rules for the composition and labelling of mixed micro-nutrient fertilisers but such mixtures are not yet listed among the fertiliser types of Annex I. Mixed micro-nutrient fertilisers therefore cannot be sold as \u2018EC fertilisers\u2019. Micro-nutrient fertiliser type designations should therefore be introduced in Annex I for solid and fluid fertilisers.\n(6) Iminodisuccinic acid (hereinafter \u2018IDHA\u2019) is a chelating agent which is authorised for use in two Member States as foliar sprays, for soil application, in hydroponics and in fertigation. IDHA should be added to the list of authorised chelating agents in Annex I to make it more easily available to farmers throughout the Union.\n(7) Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 requires the control of \u2018EC fertilisers\u2019 in accordance with the methods of analysis that are described therein. However, some methods have not been internationally recognised. EN standards have now been developed by the European Committee for Standardisation and should replace those methods.\n(8) Validated methods published as EN standards usually include a ring test (inter-laboratory test) to check the reproducibility and repeatability of the analytical methods between different laboratories. A distinction between validated EN standards and non-validated methods should therefore be made to help to identify the EN standards which have undergone an inter-laboratory test to correctly inform controllers about the statistical reliability of EN standards.\n(9) To simplify legislation and facilitate future revision, it is appropriate to replace the full text of the standards in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 with references to the EN standards to be published by the European Committee for Standardisation.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003,", "main_body":
