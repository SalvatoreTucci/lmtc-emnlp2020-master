GENERAL\n1.1. All vehicles must receive a plate and markings as described below. That plate and  those markings must be affixed by the manufacturer or his authorized representative.\n2. MANUFACTURER'S DATA PLATE\n2.1. A manufacturer's data plate, a model of which is shown in  Appendix 1 must be firmly attached, at an easily accessible point, to a part which is normally not  likely to be replaced during use; it must be easily legible and contain the following information  in an indelible form, in the following order:\n2.1.1. name of manufacturer;\n2.1.2. type-approval mark as described in Article 8 of Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992  on the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles;\n2.1.3. the vehicle identification number (VIN);\n2.1.4. the static sound level: . . . dB(A) at . . . rev/min.\n2.2. The type-approval mark as required by section 2.1.2., the static sound level value and the  number of rev/minute as required by section 2.1.4. are not included in the component type-approval  of statutory markings. However, those pieces of information must be attached to all vehicles  manufactured in conformity with the type that has been approved.\n2.3. Manufacturers may affix additional information below or to one side of the mandatory markings,  outside a clearly marked rectangle which contains only the information required by sections 2.1.1.  to 2.1.4. (see Appendix 1).\n3. VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER\nThe vehicle identification number consists of a structured  combination of characters assigned to each vehicle by their manufacturer. Its purpose is to enable  any vehicle to be identified unambiguously via its manufacturer - without any need for any other  information - for a period of 30 years. The identification must meet the following requirements:\n3.1. the vehicle identification number must be entered on the manufacturer's data plate. It must  also be hammered or punched in such a way as to avoid obliteration or change on the chassis or  frame at a point such that it can easily be accessible, and it must be situated on the right half  of the vehicle;\n3.1.1. the vehicle identification number must be in three parts as indicated hereafter:\n3.1.1.1. the first part consists of a code assigned to the vehicle manufacturer enabling that  person to be identified. The code shall consist of three characters (letters or digits) issued by  the competent authorities in the country in which the manufacturer has his registered address in  line with the practice of the international agency acting on the authorization of the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). The first character designates a geographical area, the  second a country within a geographical area and the third character a particular manufacturer.  Where the manufacturer produces less than 500 vehicles per year the third character is always a 9.  In order to identify that manufacturer the authority referred to above shall also issue the third,  fourth and fifth characters of the third part;\n3.1.1.2. the second part consists of six characters (letters or digits) for the purpose of  describing the general characteristics of the vehicle (type, variant and version); each  characteristic may be represented by two characters. If its manufacturer does not use one or more  of those characters the unused spaces must be filled by alphabetical or numerical characters, the  choice being left to the manufacturer;\n3.1.1.3. the third part consists of eight characters, the last four of which are required to be  numerical and, in combination with the two other parts, must enable a particular vehicle to be  clearly identified. Any unused position must be filled by a 0 in order to obtain the requisite  total number of characters;\n3.1.2. the vehicle identification number must, wherever possible, occupy a single line. By way of  an exception and for technical reasons it may also occupy two lines. However, in this case there  must be no breaks within any of the three parts;\nthe beginning and end of each line must be marked by a symbol which is neither an Arabic numeral  nor a capital Latin letter, nor must it be possible to confuse this with any such character. An  exemption may be granted if the number is entered on a single line on the manufacturer's data  plate. The introduction of said symbol within a line between the three parts (section 3.1.1) is  also authorized;\nThere must be no spaces between the characters.\n4. CHARACTERS\n4.1. Latin letters and Arabic numerals must be used for all of the markings provided  for in sections 2 and 3. However, the Latin letters used for the information provided for in  sections 2.1.1, 2.1.3 and 3 must be capital letters.\n4.2. In the vehicle identification number:\n4.2.1. letters I, O and Q, or dashes, asterisks or other specific signs are prohibited;\n4.2.2. letters and figures shall have the following minimum heights:\n4.2.2.1. 4 mm in the case of characters entered directly on the chassis or frame or any other  similar vehicle structure;\n4.2.2.2. 3 mm in the case of characters entered on the manufacturer's data plate.\nAppendix 1\nExample of manufacturer's data plate\nThe example below in no way affects the  information actually set out on manufacturer's data plates, nor the dimensions of the plate itself,  the figures or letters. It is given solely by way of an example.\nThe additional information referred to in section 2.3 may be entered below or on one side of the  information required in the following rectangle.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n<?aeUA16\u00e0><?aeTS\u00e0><?aeVC\u00e0><?aeRT2Y3\u00e0><?aeTF10\u00e0><?aeTB\u00e0><?aeTC\u00e0>STELLA FABBRICA  MOTOCICLI <?aeFN10\u00e0>e3 5364 <?aeFN10\u00e0>3 G S K L M 3 A C 8 B 1 2 0 0 0 0 <?aeFN10\u00e0>80 dB  (A) - 3 750 t/m<?aeFN10\u00e0><?aeTB\u00e0><?aeRT2Y3\u00e0><?aeTE\u00e0><?aeUA17\u00e0\"END OF GRAPHIC>\nLegend:\nIn the above example of a plate the vehicle concerned has been made by 'Stella Fabbrica Motocicli'  and type-approved in Italy (e3), under number 5364.\nThe identification number (3GSKLM3AC8B120000) gives the following information:\n- first part (3GS):\n- 3: geographical area (Europe);\n- G: country within the geographical area (Germany);\n- S: manufacturer (Stella Fabbrica Motocicli);\n- second part (KLM3AC):\n- KL: type of vehicle;\n- M3: variant (vehicle bodywork);\n- AC: version (vehicle engine);\n- third part (8B120000):\n- 8B12: identification of the vehicle and combination of the two other parts of the identification  number;\n- 0000: unused positions that have been filled by a 0 in order to make up the total number of  characters required.\nThe static sound level is 80 dB(A) at 3 750 rev/min.\nAppendix 2\nInformation document in respect of statutory markings for a type of two or three-wheel  motor vehicle\n(to be attached to the application for component type-approval where this is  submitted separately from the application for vehicle type-approval)\nOrder No (assigned by the  applicant): .\nThe application for component type-approval in respect of statutory markings for a type of two or  three-wheel motor vehicle shall contain the information set out in Annex II to Directive 92/61/EEC;  Part A, sections:\n- 0.1\n- 0.2\n- 0.4 to 0.6\n- 9.3.1 to 9.3.3.\nAppendix 3\nName of administration\nComponent type-approval certificate in respect of statutory  markings for a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles\nMODEL\nReport No . by technical service .  date .\nComponent type-approval No: .
