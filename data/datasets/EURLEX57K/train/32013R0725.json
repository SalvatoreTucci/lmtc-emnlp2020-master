Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Ammonium chloride was authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive, without a time limit, for use on cats and dogs and with a time limit for all pets with the exception of cats and dogs by Commission Directive 86/525/EEC\u00a0(3). That additive was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of ammonium chloride as a feed additive for cats and dogs and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use for ruminants, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 24 May 2012\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the ammonium chloride does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It recognised that the ammonium chloride is a potent urinary acidifier and a supplementation of feed for ruminants, cats and dogs results in a decrease of the urinary pH. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the ammonium chloride shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe ammonium chloride specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018other zootechnical additives\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Transitional measures\nThe additive specified in the Annex for use for cats and dogs and feed containing that additive, which are produced and labelled before 16 August 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 16 August 2013 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 310, 5.11.1986, p. 19.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2738.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
