That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of L-valine produced by Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80058) as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 8 October 2013\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the L-valine produced by Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80058) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it is considered an efficacious source of the essential amino acid L-valine for animal nutrition. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that substance shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 403/2009\u00a0(3) authorised L-valine produced by Escherichia coli. In order to ensure the differentiation of the additives in the final feed, their identification number should be labelled on feed materials and compound feed together with their name and added amount.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 403/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly. Since the modifications to the conditions of authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe substance specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018amino acids, their salts and analogues\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 403/2009\nIn the ninth column of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 403/2009, the following paragraph is added:\n\u2018Where voluntary declaration of the additive is made on the labelling of feed materials and compound feed, the following shall be included:\n\u2014 name and identification number of the additive,\n\u2014 added amount of the additive.\u2019", "Transitional measures\nFeed materials and compound feed as referred to in Article 2 which are produced and labelled before 25 February 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 25 August 2014 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.
