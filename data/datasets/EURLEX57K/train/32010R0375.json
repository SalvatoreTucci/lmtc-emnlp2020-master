The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as the Authority.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission and to deliver an opinion on a health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from PROBI AB, submitted on 22 December 2008 pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on improved iron absorption (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-785)\u00a0(2). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) improves iron absorption\u2019.\n(6) On 6 April 2009, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.\n(7) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission, pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(8) Health claims referred to in Article 13(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 are subject to the transition measures laid down in Article 28(5) of that Regulation only if they comply with the conditions therein mentioned, among which that they have to comply with the Regulation. As the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) and the claimed effect, the claim does not comply with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and therefore the transition period foreseen in Article 28(5) of that Regulation is not applicable. A transition period of six months is provided for, to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["The health claim set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall not be included in the Community list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.\nHowever, it may continue to be used for six months after the entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0404, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 999, 1-9.\nANNEX\nRejected health claims\nApplication \u2014 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 13(5) health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or including a request for the protection of proprietary data Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) improves iron absorption Q-2008-785"}
