This could be enhanced by taking account of smaller parcels. Member States should therefore be permitted to accept smaller areas for set-aside.\n(3) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1017/94 of 26 April 1994 concerning the conversion of land currently under arable crops to extensive livestock farming in Portugal(3), applications for conversion have been submitted equivalent to 35585 ha. The base area should consequently be adjusted.\n(4) The Member States have notified the results of the tests to determine the tetrahydrocannabinol levels in the hemp varieties sown in 2003. Those results should be taken into account when drawing up the list of hemp varieties qualifying for area payments in the coming marketing years and the list of varieties temporarily accepted for 2004/2005, which will require further testing during that marketing year.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 19(1), the following subparagraph is added:\"For the 2004/05 marketing year, Member States may also accept:\n(a) areas at least 10 m wide and covering 0,1 ha;\n(b) for properly justified environmental reasons, areas at least 5 m wide and covering 0,05 ha.\"\n2.
