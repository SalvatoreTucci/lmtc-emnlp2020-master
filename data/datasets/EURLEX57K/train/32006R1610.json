October 2006\nderogating from Regulations (EC) No 327/1998 and (EC) No 1291/2000 as regards certain import licences issued for the July 2006 tranche of tariff quotas for imports of rice and broken rice\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV(6) negotiations\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice\u00a0(2), and in particular Article 13(4) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Under Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 of 10 February 1998 opening and providing for the administration of certain tariff quotas for imports of rice and broken rice\u00a0(3), licences issued for imports of husked, semi-milled and wholly milled rice under the quotas opened by that Regulation are valid from their actual day of issue until the end of the third month thereafter.\n(2) Since August 2006, the pattern of imports into the European Union of rice originating in the United States of America has been disturbed by the appearance on the US market of rice contaminated with genetically modified rice known as \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019.\n(3) Under Article 2 of Commission Decision 2006/601/EC of 5 September 2006 on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised genetically modified organism \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019 in rice products\u00a0(4), the placing on the market of long A and long B rice originating in the United States of America is subject to the presentation of an analytical report demonstrating that the product does not contain genetically modified rice \u2018LL RICE 601\u2019.\n(4) In order to prevent the emergency measures laid down by Decision 2006/601/EC preventing the use, during their period of validity, of licences issued for imports of long A and long B rice originating in the United States of America under the July 2006 tranche of the quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 327/98, their period of validity should be extended until the end of 2006.\n(5) In addition, in order to allow the use of licences already issued for \u2018all country\u2019 import quotas and with the United States of America indicated as country of origin, the use of those licences should be authorised for the import of rice originating in all non-member countries.\n(6) The use of licences already issued should also be authorised for rice other than long A and long B rice.\n(7) Derogations should therefore be made from Regulation (EC) No 327/98 and from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 7(4) of
