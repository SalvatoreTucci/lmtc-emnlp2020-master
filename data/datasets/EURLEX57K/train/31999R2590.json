The Annexes to those Regulations should therefore be amended.\n(3) The need might arise in the French overseas departments for additional supplies of pure-bred breeding bovines and horses in particular marketing years. The French authorities should therefore be granted some leeway in their management of the scheme so they can issue aid certificates for animals intended for certain overseas departments in excess of the maximum quantities available to those departments, on condition that the overall maximum quantity available for all four overseas departments is complied with. In order to take proper account of such additional supply requirements for subsequent years, the French authorities should inform the Commission of cases in which certificates have been issued using this discretionary power.\n(4) As a result of the presentation by the French authorities of information on the needs of the French overseas departments, the Annexes to Regulations (EEC) No 2312/92 and (EEC) No 1148/93 should be replaced by the Annexes to this Regulation adding, for supply of breeding horses, the French overseas department R\u00e9union. The balances should be fixed on the basis of the calendar year.\n(5) Application of the criteria for fixing the amount of Community aid to the current market situation in the sector in question and, in particular, to the exchange rates and prices for those products in the European part of the Community and on the world market, gives rise to aid for the supply of the French overseas departments with pure-bred breeding animals at the levels fixed in the Annex hereto.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2312/92 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.", "Regulation (EEC) No 1148/93 is amended as follows:\n1.
