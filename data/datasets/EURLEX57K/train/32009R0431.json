In addition, the conditions for granting the financial assistance should be set out in detail in a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded between the Commission and the Member State concerned.\n(3) The rules guiding some aspects of the financial management of Community financial assistance should be clarified. For operational reasons, the Member State concerned should be asked to place the financial assistance received in a special account with its National Central Bank and to transfer the amounts due to an account with the European Central Bank a few days prior to their due dates.\n(4) Sound management of the Community financial assistance received is of paramount importance. Therefore, without prejudice to Article 27 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for the European Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office, when they deem necessary, to carry out controls in the Member State receiving Community medium-term financial assistance, as already provided for in the existing loan agreements.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) This Regulation should apply immediately to all new loan agreements and to the existing loan agreements if and when they are revised,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(1), the second subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\n2.
