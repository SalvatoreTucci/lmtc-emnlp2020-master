The capacity of the tanks shall be determined:\n\u2014 either by the transfer of water or another suitable liquid, whose volume is measured by measures or measuring equipment with meters specially calibrated for this purpose,\n\u2014 or by calculating on the basis of the tank dimensions, as determined; this operation shall be supplemented, where possible, by a partial cross check using measured volumes of liquid.\n2. The calibration operations shall be carried out in such a manner and with instruments of such precision that the relative errors in respect of the capacities stated in the documents issued do not exceed:\n(a) as a general rule: \u00b1 3/1000 of the capacity indicated\n(b) exceptionally, in the case of tanks with a very complicated shape which cannot be calibrated by transfer: \u00b1 5/1000 of the capacity indicated.\n3. The results of the calibration operations shall be recorded in a calibration certificate which is accompanied by digrams and tables showing, in particular, the volume of liquid, expressed in litres or cubic decimetres or cubic metres, which is in the tank when the level of the free surface of the liquid is at a given height, expressed in centimetres or decimetres, on the vertical face of the measure of length.\n4. A calibration plate shall be fixed on each tank, in the vicinity of the measure orifice.\n\u2014 the number of the tank,\n\u2014 the total reference height H,\n\u2014 the number of the calibration certificate.\n5. The calibration certificate shall not be issued unless the construction and arrangement of the tanks and connecting pipes are such that under the normal operating conditions of the vessel, the tanks and connecting pipes can, without difficulty, be totally emptied or totally filled without pockets of air becoming trapped above or in the liquid being measured, below the level at which the tank is considered full.\n6. The vertical face of the measure of length at which the heights of the liquid are determined shall pass, as a general rule, approximately through the centre of gravity of the horizontal sections of the tank, in every part where a free surface of the liquid may occur when measurements are made under normal conditions of use.\n7. Taking into account:\n(a) the precision with which the volumes specified in the tables have been determined,\n(b) the precision with which the level of the free surface of the liquid may be determined in the tanks,\n8. The sealing marks, the calibration certificates and the calibration tables cease to be valid\n\u2014 after twelve years,\n\u2014 or as soon as the tank has become deformed, or been repaired or reconstructed, in a way liable to alter its measurement characteristics.\nANNEX II\nCALIBRATION RECORDS\nThe calibration record, issued by a competent metrological authority, shall be composed of the following documents:\n1. The calibration certificate proper, giving:\n(a) the name and address of the competent authority which issues the certificate;\n(b) the name and position of the operator;\n(c) the serial number of the certificate (which is reproduced on all the other documents and on the calibration plates);\n(d) the date of issue of the certificate and the address of the place of employment of the calibration official;\n(e) the expiry date of the certificate;\n(f) the identity of the vessel (name, registration number, name and address of owner and year of construction);\n(g) list and nature of the documents attached;\n(h) the groups of tanks for which the same table may be used;\n(i) an indication of the tanks in which there are drainage sumps or heaters;\n(j) the total capacity;\n(k) the precision of the results given in the tables;\n(l) the precision of the use of the calibration record for the determination of the volumes of the liquid contained in tanks;\n(m) the minimum measurable height.\n2. A Diagram No 1 showing the position of the tanks in the vessel, and for each tank the total reference height H, the positioning of the measure and the position of the latter in relation to the forward bulkhead of the tank and to the longitudinal median bulkhead or plane.\n3. A Diagram No 2, being a transverse cross section of the tanks showing, in particular, the radius of the bilge, the camber, the height of the trunk and the method of construction of the guiding device.\n4. In the case of a vessel having heaters or drainage sumps inside its tanks, a Diagram No 3 giving the volume taken up by these heaters or sumps and the volume of liquid which can be contained in the latter, from sluice-valve to sluice-valve.\n5. For each tank or group of similar tanks, a centimetre or decimetre volume table containing an indication of the total reference height H and of the expiry date and, where supplied, a millimetre interpolation table.\nANNEX III\nMODEL CERTIFICATE OF CALIBRATION\nANNEX IV\nMODEL CALIBRATION TABLE"}
