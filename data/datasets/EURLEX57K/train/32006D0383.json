Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by use of the method termed \u201cUltra-sound IS-D-05\u201d.\n2. The grading apparatus IS-D-05 is a device for measuring the lean meat and fat thickness on the basis of response analysis of the range of ultrasonic impulses which are transmitted in sequence into the carcass in the specified place. Ultrasonic probe scans treated carcasses with the set of 3 \u00d7 100 ultrasonic impulses at frequency of 4\u00a0MHz in the time of scanning.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcass shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nPART 6\nNeedle IS-D-15\n1. Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by use of the method termed \u201cNeedle IS-D-15\u201d.\n2. The grading apparatus IS-D-15 is a device using a sharp needle probe which is inserted into a given place of the carcass; the insertion depth is about 140\u00a0mm. A special engineered optical set is located behind the needle that by the means of an optical channel enlightens the surrounding tissue or area and scans the amount of reflected light energy with the defined wavelength. The terminal is also equipped with a precise contactless measuring device which determines the current insertion depth with 46 micrometer precision.\n3.
