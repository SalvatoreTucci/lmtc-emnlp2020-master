The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) has adopted new oenological practices. In order to meet the international standards in this field and to provide EU producers with the new possibilities available to third country producers, these new oenological practices should be authorised in the EU under the conditions of use defined by the OIV.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 authorises clarification by means of pectolytic enzymes and enzymatic preparations of beta-glucanase. These enzymes and other enzymatic preparations are also used for maceration, clarification, stabilisation, filtration and for revealing the aromatic precursors of grapes present in the must and the wine. These oenological practices have been adopted by the OIV and they should be authorised under the conditions of use defined by the OIV.\n(3) Wines entitled to the protected designations of origin \u2018Malta\u2019 and \u2018Gozo\u2019 have a sugar content greater than 45\u00a0g/l and are produced in small quantities. Likewise, certain French white wines with a protected geographical indication may have a total alcoholic strength by volume greater than 15\u00a0% vol. and a sugar content greater than 45\u00a0g/l. In order to ensure the preservation of these wines, the Member States concerned, i.e., Malta and France, respectively, requested a derogation to the maximum sulphur dioxide contents given in Annex I B to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009. These wines should be mentioned in the list of wines having a maximum sulphur dioxide content of 300 milligrams per litre.\n(4) Wines entitled to the traditional expression \u2018K\u00e9s\u0151i sz\u00fcretel\u00e9s\u0171 bor\u2019 have a very high sugar content and are produced in small quantities. In order to ensure the preservation of these wines, Hungary requested a derogation to the maximum sulphur dioxide content. A maximum sulphur dioxide content of 350 milligrams per litre should be authorised for these wines.\n(5) Wines entitled to the protected designation of origin \u2018Douro\u2019 followed by the statement \u2018colheita tardia\u2019 derogate from the maximum sulphur dioxide content. Wines entitled to the protected designation of origin \u2018Duriense\u2019 have the same characteristics as these wines. On the basis of this, Portugal requested a derogation from the maximum sulphur dioxide content. A maximum sulphur dioxide content of 400 milligrams per litre should be authorised for these wines.\n(6) In order to render the names of vine varieties clearer, the names of the varieties should be given in the different languages of the countries where these varieties are used.\n(7) Certain provisions concerning certain liqueur wines differ from the requirements laid down in the specifications for these wines. These provisions should be amended in accordance with the requirements in question.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The making of wine from grapes harvested during the 2010 wine-growing year has already begun. In order not to distort competition between wine producers, the new oenological practices should be authorised for all these producers starting at the beginning of the 2010 wine-growing year. This regulation should apply retroactively from 1 August 2010, which marks the start of the 2010 wine-growing year.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee established by Article 195(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 shall be amended as follows:\n(a) Annex I A is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation;\n(b) Annex I B is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation;\n(c) Annex II is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation;\n(d) Annex III is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 January 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 193, 24.7.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAnnex I A to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 shall be amended as follows:\n(1) The table shall be amended as follows:\n(a) line 10 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u201810 clarification by means of one or more of the following substances for oenological use:\n\u2014 edible gelatine,\n\u2014 plant proteins from wheat or peas,\n\u2014 isinglass,\n\u2014 casein and potassium caseinates,\n\u2014 egg albumin,\n\u2014 bentonite,\n\u2014 silicon dioxide as a gel or colloidal solution,\n\u2014 kaolin,\n\u2014 tannin,\n\u2014 chitosan of fungoid origin,\n\u2014 chitin-glucan of fungoid origin\n(b) the following entries shall be added:\n\u201844 Treatment using chitosan of fungoid origin Under the conditions set out in Appendix 13\n45 Treatment using chitin-glucan of fungoid origin Under the conditions set out in Appendix 13\n46 Acidification by means of electro-membranary treatment Conditions and limits laid down in points C and D of Annex XVa to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and Articles 11 and 13 of this Regulation\n47 Use of enzymatic preparations for oneological purposes in maceration, clarification, stabilisation, filtration and to reveal the aromatic precursors of grapes present in the must and the wine Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 9(2) of this Regulation, enzymatic preparations and the enzyme activities of these preparations (i.e., pectolyase, pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, hemicellulase, cellulase, betaglucanase and glycosidase) must comply with the corresponding purity and identification specifications of the International Oenological Codex published by the OIV\u2019\n(2) Appendix 1 shall be deleted.\n(3) The following Appendices 13 and 14 shall be added:\n(a) reduction in the heavy metal content, particularly iron, lead, cadmium and copper;\n(b) prevention of ferric casse and copper casse;\n(c) reduction of possible contaminants, especially ochratoxin A;\n(d) reduction in the populations of undesirable micro-organisms, in particular Brettanomyces, solely by means of treatment with chitosan.\n\u2014 The dose levels to be used are determined after a qualification test.
