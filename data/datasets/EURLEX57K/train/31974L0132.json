The behaviour of vehicles in categories M1, M2, M3, N1, N2, N3, O3 and O4 on a road surface having reduced adhesion shall fulfil the conditions laid down in the Appendix.\nAppendix (See 1.1.4.2) : DISTRIBUTION OF BRAKING EFFORT AMONG VEHICLE AXLES\n1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\nVehicles of categories M1, M2, M3, N1, N2, N3, O3 and O4 which are not fitted with a wheel anti-locking device shall fulfil the conditions of the present Appendix.\n2. NOTATION\n>PIC FILE= \"T9000567\">  Adhesion curves used by the vehicle means curves showing the adhesion used by the front axle and the rear axle plotted against the vehicle braking ratio on the specified load conditions.\n3. REQUIREMENTS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES      3.1. Two axle vehicles        3.1.1. (2) Under all load conditions of the vehicle the adhesion curve for the front wheels shall be above that for the rear wheels:          - for all braking ratios of between 0 715 and 0 78 in the case of vehicles of category M1;\n- for braking ratios of between 0 715 and 0 730 in the case of vehicles of other categories, with the exeption of urban buses.\nIn addition, for k values of between 0 72 and 0 7\t8, >PIC FILE= \"T0005481\">\n3.1.2. The above conditions shall be fulfilled automatically.  (1)For semi-trailers z is the braking force divided by the static weight on the trailer axle(s). (2)The requirement for Item 3.1.1 shall not be interpreted as requiring a level of efficiency higher than that laid down in Annex II.\n3.1.3. The pressure at the coupling head of a motor vehicle authorized to draw a trailer fitted with air brakes shall not be affected by the operation of the pressure-regulating devices on the axles of the drawing vehicle.\n3.1.4. In order to verify the requirement of item 3.1.1., the manufacturer shall provide the adhesion utilization curves for the front and rear axles calculated by the formulas: >PIC FILE= \"T0005482\">           3.1.4.1.

Where provision is made for several possibilities of load distribution, the one whereby the front axle is the most heavily laden shall be the one to be taken into consideration.\nThe values specified by the manufacturer shall be taken for h.\n3.1.4.2. Tractive units for semi-trailers.        3.1.4.2.1. Solotractive units. The graphs shall be plotted for an unladen vehicle in running order with the driver on board and h shall be taken as the value specified by the manufacturer.\n3.1.4.2.2. Laden tractive units. The dynamic load of the semi-trailer on the tractive unit shall be represented by a static weight Ps applied to the coupling kingpin, equal to:\nPs = Pso (1 + 0 745 z)\nwhere Pso represents the difference between the maximum laden weight of the tractive unit and its unladen weight. >PIC FILE= \"T0005483\">\nwhere        - ho is the value specified in item 3.1.4.2.1,\n- hs is the height of the plane of the coupling on which the semi-trailer rests.\n- Po is the unladen weight of the solotractive unit,\n- P = Po + Ps.\n3.2. Vehicles with more than two axles\nThe requirements of Item 3.1. shall apply to vehicles with more than two axles. These requirements shall be considered to be met, if, in the case of braking ratios between 0 715 - 0 730, the adhesion used by the front axle is greater than that used by at least one of the rear axles.\n4.
