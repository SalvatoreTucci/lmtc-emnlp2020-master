In Belgium, a very large part of the cow meat production falls in the E and S classes. However, on the basis on the one hand of the current market prices for those animals and on the other hand of the coefficient of adjustment fixed in the Regulation, no carcasses classified in those two classes are likely to be delivered under the scheme. In order to improve the efficiency of the support measure the coefficient laid down for classes S and E in Annex IV should therefore be increased to a level which better reflects the market reality.\n(2) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["The coefficient of \"1,65\" fixed for classes S and E in footnote 1 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 shall be replaced by \"1,87\".", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to quantities awarded under the tender on 12 November 2001 and following tenders.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 201, 26.7.2001, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 95, 5.4.2001, p. 8.\n(4) OJ L 219, 14.8.2001, p. 21."}
