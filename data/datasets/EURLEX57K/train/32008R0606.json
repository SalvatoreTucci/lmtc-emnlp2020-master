It lists the different surveys and data sources to which it applies.\n(2) There is growing demand from researchers and the scientific community in general to have access for scientific purposes also to confidential data from the Farm Structure Survey (FSS). Access to the FSS microdata would enable researchers to study the relationships between the different characteristics of individual agricultural holdings, such as the types of crops grown, livestock and labour force. It would also enable researchers to improve regional agri-environmental models and indicators that are currently based on aggregated data. This survey should therefore be added to the list in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0831/2002.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Statistical Confidentiality,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0831/2002 is amended as follows:\n1.
