Demand for cauliflowers also fluctuates in line with the weather, but inversely to supply. The market in fresh cauliflowers is therefore marked by rapid and unpredictable developments, with an extremely wide range of prices charged on the markets in fresh cauliflowers not intended for processing. Fluctuations occur each year, at irregular intervals and to varying degrees, which causes continuing difficulties for the cauliflower sector.\n(2) Under the intervention arrangements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and implemented by Commission Regulation (EC) No 103/2004 of 21 January 2004 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards intervention arrangements and market withdrawals in the fruit and vegetable sector\u00a0(2), the quantities withdrawn may not exceed 10\u00a0% of the quantity marketed at any point of the marketing year. The scale of the short-term cyclical developments for cauliflowers is such that these limits prevent effective regulation of the market by producer organisations using only the general instruments of intervention.\n(3) To improve competitiveness in the sector, provisions should be introduced to smooth cyclical developments by allowing, through the payment of a specific aid, the processing of certain quantities intended initially for the fresh product market where excess supply leads to a collapse in prices and provided that these quantities meet certain quality requirements. However, to avoid this mechanism generating a rise in production, the amount of aid must remain well below the difference in the prices of cauliflowers intended for the fresh product market and cauliflowers intended for processing.\n(4) There is also a need to ensure that producer organisations employ their own resources for the prevention and management of cyclical crises. As a result, the minimum quantities delivered for processing must be taken over by producer organisations without benefiting from the aid, for the purposes of prevention and management of cyclical crises.\n(5) As the purpose of the operation is to smooth out the occasional peaks in production, the total share of production which may benefit from either these new provisions or the traditional withdrawals mechanism must continue to be limited to 15\u00a0%.\n(6) Producer organisations wishing to make use of these provisions must guarantee the processors with whom they work supplies of minimum quantities throughout the marketing year, by means of contracts, so that the activity of those processors does not depend entirely on crises affecting cauliflowers intended for the fresh market.\n(7) To identify a state of crisis, a price quotation must be fixed as a reference amount for monitoring cyclical developments on the market in fresh cauliflowers, as must the price level below which, for this price quotation, the market in fresh cauliflowers must be considered to be in crisis and specific measures may be triggered.\n(8) This kind of system means that producers must notify all deliveries of cauliflowers for processing, even those which do not benefit from the aid in question, in order to allow checks on the total quantities processed.\n(9) Specific measures are innovative compared with the general instruments used by the common organisations of the markets in fruit and vegetables. At this stage, therefore, their scope should be limited in terms of budget and quantity and also of time, so as to allow a precise assessment of the impact of these measures before these provisions are extended. As a result, in order to avoid any budget overrun, a system for the quarterly notification of aid applications should be organised to enable a reduction percentage for applications to be fixed where necessary. In this kind of notification system, any delay in communicating aid applications by producer organisations renders the operation ineligible.\n(10) Checks on the total quantities processed must cover the lots that are physically presented, to ensure that they tally with the weight declarations, and, a posteriori, that the physical flows declared tally with the transactions recorded by the producer organisations and processors. Checks should be accompanied by penalties commensurate with any failings.\n(11) Finally, to ensure close monitoring of the measure by the Commission, Member States must transmit the required information to the Commission as quickly as possible.\n(12) The Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Purpose\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of this Regulation, producer organisations shall receive aid of EUR 50 per tonne for certain cauliflowers harvested in the Community falling within CN code ex\u00a00704\u00a010\u00a000 delivered for processing when price levels have dropped on the fresh cauliflower market.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall be paid quarterly, in accordance with the periods laid down in the second paragraph of Article 3, for certain quantities of cauliflowers delivered to processors and accepted by those processors where the price conditions referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 5(5) have been met.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each quarter concerned, without prejudice to Article 8(4), the aid referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be paid for the quantities delivered to processors, and accepted by those processors, in excess of the minimum quantities referred to in Article 4(2)(c).\nThe sum of the quantities benefiting from the aid referred to in paragraph 1 and of the quantities withdrawn under the terms of Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 may not, however, exceed 15\u00a0% of the quantities marketed in the same quarter.", "Minimum quality requirements\nProducts delivered for processing must be whole, of sound, genuine and merchantable quality and suitable for processing.
