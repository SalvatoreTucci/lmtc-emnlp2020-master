For the efficient management of the domestic market in skimmed-milk powder - a product that may be subject to intervention measures - export licences for that product should be made compulsory and provision should be made for the notification of this information by the Member States to the Commission. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1498/1999 of 8 July 1999 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards communications between Member States and the Commission in the milk and milk products sector(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 732/2001(6), should therefore be amended.\n(2) A drafting error in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should be corrected.\n(3) The sucrose component of milk products is not taken into account when the basic amount of the refund for the milk content is fixed at zero.

In order to best ensure that this quota is actually filled and that the licences issued to this end are really used, provision should be made for the lodgement of a security.\n(5) In order to simplify the securities for the provisional licences referred to in Article 20, the security for the provisional licence should be adjusted and the operation of the security for the full licence should be described in detail.\n(6) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is amended as follows:\n1.
