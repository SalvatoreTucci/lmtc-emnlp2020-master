That according to the progress of scientific and technological knowledge, the limits for the raw nuts and dried fruit could be reconsidered within a defined period of time;\nWhereas in the case of the cereals, it cannot be excluded that sorting methods or other physical treatments can reduce the level of contamination of aflatoxins; that in order to be able to check the real effectiveness of these methods and, if necessary, to fix specific maximum limits for the unprocessed cereals, it is foreseen for a limited period to apply the maximum limits as laid down in the Annex only for the cereals and processed products thereof intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient in foodstuffs; that in the absence of data justifying the fixing of a specific maximum limit for unprocessed cereals, after a well-defined period of time, the maximum limit laid down for the cereals and the processed products thereof intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient of food, will also apply to the unprocessed cereals;\nWhereas to allow effective control of the respect of the various limits fixed for the products in question, it is appropriate to know the exact destination by suitable labelling;\nWhereas products with levels of aflatoxin exceeding the maximum limit may not be brought into circulation, either as such, after mixture with other foodstuffs or as an ingredient in other foodstuffs;\nWhereas under Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 315/93, Member States may maintain their national provisions concerning the maximum limits for aflatoxins in certain foodstuffs for which no Community provisions have been adopted;\nWhereas it suffices for the moment to lay down general provisions for processed and compound foodstuffs; whereas specific maximum limits for aflatoxins in processed and compound foodstuffs could be fixed in case of need;\nWhereas the Scientific Committee for Food has been consulted, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 315/93, on the provisions liable to affect public health;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 194/97 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 2(1) is replaced by the following:\n'1. (a) The products indicated in the Annex to this Regulation must not, when placed on the market, contain higher contaminant levels than those specified therein.\n(b) The maximum limits applicable to the products, as laid down in points I.2.1.1.1 and I.2.1.2.1 of the Annex shall also be applicable to processed products thereof in so far as no specific maximum limits are fixed for such processed products.\n(c) For milk products which are dried, processed or composed of more than one ingredient, the maximum limit applicable shall be that laid down in point I.2.1.3 of the Annex for milk, taking into account respectively the concentration caused by the drying process, by processing or the relative concentrations of the ingredients in the product, in so far as no specific maximum limits are fixed for these dried, processed or compound milk products.`\n2. In Article 2, paragraphs 4 and 5 are added as follows:\n'4. With regard to the products mentioned at point I.2.1 of the Annex, it is prohibited:\n- to mix products complying with the maximum limits laid down in the Annex with products exceeding these maximum limits or to mix products to be subjected to a sorting technique or physical treatment with products intended for direct human consumption or as an ingredient in foodstuffs,\n- to use products which do not comply with the maximum limits laid down in point I.2.1.1.1, I.2.1.2.1 and I.2.1.3 as an ingredient for the manufacture of other foodstuffs,\n- to detoxify products by chemical treatments.\n5. Groundnuts, nuts and dried fruit not complying with the maximum limits laid down in point I.2.1.1.1 of the Annex and cereals not complying with the maximum limits laid down in point I.2.1.2.1 can be placed on the market provided that:\n(a) these products:\n- are not intended for direct human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs,\n- comply with the maximum limits laid down in point I.2.1.1.2 of the Annex for groundnuts and point I.2.1.1.3 of the Annex for nuts and dried fruit, and\n- are subjected to a secondary treatment involving sorting or other physical treatments and that after this treatment the maximum limits laid down in points I.2.1.1.1 and I.2.1.2.1 of the Annex are not exceeded, and this treatment does not result in other harmful residues;\n(b) the destination of these products is demonstrated clearly by labelling comprising the indication \"product must be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment to reduce aflatoxin contamination before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs\"`.\n3.
