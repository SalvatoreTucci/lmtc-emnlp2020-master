That Regulation also provides for model passports for the movement of those animals to be established. Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is to apply from 3 July 2004. Directive 92/65/EEC has been amended with a view to implement the same rules to the movements of the animals concerned when traded.\n(2) Accordingly, it is appropriate to establish a model passport that can be used for all movements of dogs, cats and ferrets between the Member States. The model passport should include details of certification requirements regarding anti-rabies vaccinations, as well as the other requirements of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 concerning the health status of those animals. It should also be in a format that can be easily checked by the Competent Authority.\n(3) The model passport should also provide for certifications of other vaccinations, not required under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 for the movements of dogs, cats and ferrets between Member States, to be included so that the passport provides all the necessary information regarding the health status of the animal in question.\n(4) In addition, the model passport should include a section on clinical examination and legalisation so that the passports can also be used for the movement of those animals outside the Community.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["This Decision establishes the model passport for the movement of pet animals of the species dogs, cats and ferrets between Member States as provided for in Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 (the model passport).", "The model passport is set out in Annex I.", "The model passport must comply with the additional requirements set out in Annex II.", "This Decision shall apply from the 3 July 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 November 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nModel Passport for the movement of pet animals of the species dogs, cats and ferrets between Member States, as provided for in Article 2.\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000302.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000303.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000401.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000402.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000403.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000501.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000502.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000601.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000602.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000701.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000702.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000801.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000802.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000901.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.000902.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001001.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001002.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001101.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001102.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001201.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001202.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003312EN.001203.TIF\">\nANNEX II\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING THE MODEL PASSPORT AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 3\nA.
