These codes are given for information only.\n(2) The product under investigation is footwear with uppers of leather or composition leather, excluding sports footwear, footwear involving special technology, slippers and other indoor footwear and footwear with a protective toecap consigned from Macao SAR (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are antidumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006\u00a0(3).\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS\n(4) The Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned are being circumvented by means of the transhipment via Macao SAR and/or by assembly in Macao SAR of the product under investigation.\n(5) The evidence is as follows:\n\u2014 the request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People's Republic of China and Macao SAR to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change,\n\u2014 this change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment of certain footwear with uppers of leather originating in the People's Republic of China via Macao SAR and/or assembly in Macao SAR of certain footwear with uppers of leather,\n\u2014 furthermore, the evidence points to the fact that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of the product under investigation appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures,\n\u2014 finally, the Commission has sufficient prima facie evidence at its disposal that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.\n(6) Should circumvention practices via Macao SAR covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment and assembly, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(7) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation, whether declared as originating in Macao SAR or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article\u00a014(5) of the basic Regulation.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n(8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Macao SAR, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of the People's Republic of China and Macao SAR. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.\n(9) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.\n(10) The authorities of the People's Republic of China and Macao SAR will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(11) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exemption of imports from registration or measures\n(12) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if such importation does not constitute circumvention.\n(13) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers in Macao SAR of certain footwear with uppers of leather that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGISTRATION\n(14) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Macao SAR.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(15) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 producers in Macao SAR may request exemption of imports from registration or measures,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\n(16) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(17) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(18) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(19) Any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18\u00a0December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of footwear with uppers of leather or composition leather as defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006, consigned from Macao SAR, whether originating in Macao SAR or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by the latter Regulation.
