Difficulty in taxonomic identification of the different species and the fact that it cannot be excluded that all species are harmful, make it necessary to regulate the genus Pomacea (Perry). That genus is neither listed in Annex I nor in Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC.\n(3) Given the risk of spreading the specified organism to fields and watercourses and the absence of less restrictive measures efficiently combating the threat posed by that organism, it is necessary to prohibit the introduction into and the spread within the Union of that genus.\n(4) Measures should also be provided for concerning the introduction into and the movement within the Union of plants for planting, excluding seeds, that can only grow in water or soil that is permanently saturated with water.\n(5) Surveys for the presence of the genus Pomacea (Perry) should be carried out in areas where the specific organism is likely to be found and the results notified.\n(6) Member States should establish demarcated areas in cases where the genus Pomacea (Perry) is found to be present in fields and watercourses in order to eradicate the organisms concerned and to ensure intensive monitoring for their presence.\n(7) Member States should, if necessary, adapt their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(8) This Decision should be reviewed by 28 February 2015.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Prohibitions concerning the genus Pomacea (Perry)\nThe genus Pomacea (Perry), hereinafter \u2018the specified organism\u2019, shall not be introduced into or spread within the Union.", "Introduction of plants for planting, excluding seeds, that can only grow in water or soil that is permanently saturated with water\nPlants for planting, excluding seeds, that can only grow in water or soil that is permanently saturated with water, hereinafter \u2018the specified plants\u2019, originating in third countries may be introduced into the Union if they comply with the requirements, as set out in point (1) of Section 1 of Annex I.\nOn entry into the Union the specified plants shall be inspected by the responsible official body in accordance with point (2) of Section I of Annex I.", "Movement of specified plants within the Union\nSpecified plants originating in demarcated areas established in accordance with Article 5 may be moved within the Union if they meet the conditions, as set out in Section 2 of Annex I.", "Surveys and notifications of the specified organism\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall conduct annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism on rice plants and, where appropriate, other specified plants in fields and watercourses.\nMember States shall notify the results of those surveys to the Commission and to the other Member States by 31 December of each year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the specified organism is found or suspected to be present in fields and watercourses, it shall immediately be notified to the responsible official bodies.", "Demarcated areas, measures to be taken in such areas, awareness raising programmes and notification\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where based on the results of the surveys referred to in Article 4(1) or other evidence, a Member State finds the specified organism to be present in a field or watercourse in its territory where its presence was previously unknown, that Member State shall without delay establish, or where appropriate amend, a demarcated area consisting of an infested zone and a buffer zone, as set out in Section 1 of Annex II.\nIn the demarcated area it shall take all measures necessary for the eradication of the specified organism.

In other cases where it is appropriate, Member States may establish a demarcated area including several demarcated areas and the areas between them.\n(5) When establishing the infested zone and the buffer zone, Member States shall, bearing in mind sound scientific principles, take into account the following elements: the biology of the specified organism, the level of infestation, the distribution of specified plants, the evidence of establishment of the specified organism, the capacity of the specified organism to spread naturally.\n(6) If the specified organism has been found to be present in the buffer zone the delimitation of the infested zone and of the buffer zone shall be amended accordingly.\nSection 2\nMeasures in demarcated areas, as provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 5(1)\nEradication measures taken by Member States in demarcated areas shall include the following:\n(a) the removal and destruction of the specified organism;\n(b) intensive monitoring for the presence of the specified organism by inspections twice a year with a specific focus on the buffer zone;\n(c) Member States shall provide for a hygiene protocol for all used agriculture and aquaculture machinery which may come into contact with the specified organism and be capable of spreading it."}
