The maximum level proposed by the applicant is 12\u00a0600\u00a0mg/kg of casings leading to a maximum carry-over of phosphates from casings in the final sausage of 250\u00a0mg/kg. The highest contribution of phosphates via treated natural casings will be 2,1\u00a0% of the MTDI. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of sodium phosphates as an acidity regulator to improve the mechanical properties of casings for sausages.\n(8) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of sodium phosphates (E 339) for the improvement of the mechanical properties of natural casings for sausages constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health for the aforesaid reasons, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Reports of the Scientific Committee for Food, Twenty-fifth series (page 13), 1991, available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_25.pdf\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, the following entry is inserted in the food category 08.2.3 \u2018Casings and coatings and decoration for meat\u2019 after the entry for E 338-452:\n\u2018E 339 Sodium phosphates 12\u00a0600 (4) (80) only in natural casings for sausages\n(4): The maximum level is expressed as P2O5\n(80): Carry-over in the final product shall not exceed 250\u00a0mg/kg\u2019"}
