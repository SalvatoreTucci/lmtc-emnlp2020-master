In implementation of this Protocol, the EC\u2013Switzerland Joint Committee, by its Decision No 1/2008\u00a0(3), amended the domestic reference prices from 1 February 2008 resulting in the imposition of duties on imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products covered by Regulation (EC) No 3448/93.\n(2) Consequently the reduced agricultural components and the additional duties applicable to imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 634/2008\u00a0(4).\n(3) In implementation of Protocol 2 the EC\u2013Switzerland Joint Committee, by its Decision No 2/2008\u00a0(5), amended the domestic reference prices from 1 August 2008, with the result that the price compensation measures referred to in Article 3(3) of the Protocol are fixed at zero. Consequently, from that date, import duties will no longer be payable on imports into the Community of certain goods containing milk products covered by Regulation (EC) No 3448/1993 from Switzerland.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 634/2008 should accordingly be repealed.\n(5) Since the reference prices as amended in accordance with Protocol 2 are applicable from 1 August 2008, the measure provided for in this Regulation should apply from the same date,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 634/2008 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 September 2008.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 318, 20.12.1993, p. 18.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 23, 26.1.2005, p. 19.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 69, 13.3.2008, p. 34.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 4.7.2008, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Not yet published in the OJ."}
