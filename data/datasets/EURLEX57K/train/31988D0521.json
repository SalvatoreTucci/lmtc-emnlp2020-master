This will be implemented through research on environmental protection, on industrial hazards and on the application of remote sensing techniques. This research will be conducted through the joint drawing up of reference measurement methods and analysis techniques, the collection and dissemination of data, the conduct of several collaborative Community-wide projects and the operation of both existing and new experimental facilities of Community interest,\n- ensuring that the manufacturing industries of the Community have better access to a range of advanced materials and that these materials are produced by cost-effective means and incorporated in high-performance components and in particular by establishing improved methods for the characterization of advanced materials, by performance assessment techniques, by data collection and dissemination, including a data bank to be made publicly available, and through the operation of experimental facilities of Community-wide interest,\n- the scientific and technical knowledge necessary for further harmonization and standardization notably in the industrial and energy fields by research on reference methods, reliability of structures and reference methods in non-nuclear energies. This will include the construction of a new facility for examining the reliability of structures and the operation of this and existing experimental facilities of Community-wide interest, establishment of common methods and codes for testing, and common models for describing the behaviour of structures, mechanical systems and common methods for assessing the performance of non-nuclear energy systems,\n- the strengthening of the economic and social cohesion of the Community. This will be achieved through the exchange schemes for scientific and technical personnel from the public and private sectors in all Member States to the JRC and vice-versa for at least 120 persons, and through a scheme of associated laboratories fostering a close and permanent collaboration between these laboratories and the JRC, in particular with laboratories in Member States and their regions most interested in this scheme,\n- the enhancement of the relevance of the JRC scientific venture in ensuring specific users for its expected results,\n- increasing the scientific consensus on environmental and safety issues, in associating national laboratories, universities and industry to the JRC specific research programmes through technical meetings, exchange of personnel and, where possible, through the drawing-up of common studies and common projects,\n- increasing industrial competitivity in accelerating technology transfer from JRC specific research programmes to industry, notably in implementing these programmes, when possible, in the framework of industrial cooperation, where exchange of personnel will be a vital component of the association."}
