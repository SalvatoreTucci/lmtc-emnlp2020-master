Caffeine is one such substance.\n(5) It would therefore be useful to make it compulsory for the labelling of the products concerned to emphasise the presence of certain substances by means of an explicit warning which consumers could not overlook.\n(6) However, such a measure applied unilaterally by the Netherlands in respect of caffeine would be sure to hinder intra-Community trade. In addition, the reference to an equivalent number of cups of coffee appears imprecise and ambiguous, indeed liable to be misinterpreted by consumers.\n(7) This finding has prompted the Commission to deliver a negative opinion in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 79/112/EEC.\n(8) The most satisfactory solution to the problem posed by the draft Netherlands Regulation will be to draw up a Community labelling provision. The Commission will do all it can to reach a satisfactory solution such as this within the time period laid down in Article 1 of this Decision.\n(9) It is therefore necessary to suspend any national initiative in this field for an appropriate period of time.\n(10) The measures laid down in this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of the Netherlands is hereby required to suspend, for a period of 12 months from the date of notification of this Decision, the adoption of that part of its draft Regulation which concerns labelling provisions making it compulsory to indicate \"contains 150 to 350 mg/l of caffeine, corresponding to 2 to 4 cups of coffee\" on soft drinks containing caffeine.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 33, 8.2.1979, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 21."}
