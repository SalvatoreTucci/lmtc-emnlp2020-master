Diphosphates (E 450), specified in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, may be used as an alternative to Sodium aluminium phosphate (E541) thus reducing the aluminium content of processed foods. The currently specified diphosphates have an astringent aftertaste (\u2018pyro-taste\u2019) and may contribute to the total sodium content of food.\n(6) Specifications for Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate should be set out in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, since the substance could be used as an alternative to the other diphosphates in order to reduce the \u2018pyro-taste\u2019 and to avoid increasing the sodium level of a food. Therefore, the use of Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphatese should be authorized in the categories 6.2.1: Flours, only self-raising flour; 6.5: Noodles; 6.6: Batters; 7.1: Bread and rolls and 7.2: Fine bakery wares. The number E 450 (ix) should be assigned to Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate.\n(7) Similar substances, with equal or higher magnesium content compared to Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate, the mono- and dibasic magnesium salts of orthophosphoric acid (E343i; E343ii) are already authorised for use in the same food categories. The inclusion of Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate as an alternative diphosphate in the annex of Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 and its subsequent use in foodstuffs will not result in an increase of phosphorous or magnesium intake. Therefore, the establishment of the specification and the specific authorisation of the use of Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate (E 450 (ix)) as a raising agent and acidity regulator is not considered of safety concern.\n(8) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the inclusion of Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate in the annex of EC regulation 231/2012 and the authorisation of the use of Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate (E 450 (ix)) as a raising agent is not considered of safety concern it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(9) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1).\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) The tabel in point (l) of Part C, is replaced by the following table:\n\u2018E-number Name\nE 338 Phosphoric acid\nE 339 Sodium phosphates\nE 340 Potassium phosphates\nE 341 Calcium phosphates\nE 343 Magnesium phosphates\nE 450 Diphosphates\u00a0(1)\nE451 Triphosphates\nE 452 Polyphosphates\n(2) Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(a) In category 06.2.1 \u2018Flours\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry E 338 - 452:\n\u2018E 450 (ix) Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate 15\u00a0000 (4)(81) Only self raising flour\n(81) the total amount of phosphates shall not exceed the maximum level for E 338 - 452\u2019\n(b) In category 06.5 \u2018Noodles\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry E 338 - 452:\n\u2018E 450 (ix) Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate 2\u00a0000 (4)(81)\n(81) the total amount of phosphates shall not exceed the maximum level for E 338 - 452\u2019\n(c) In category 06.6 \u2018Batters\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 338 - 452:\n\u2018E 450 (ix) Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate 12\u00a0000 (4)(81)\n(81) the total amount of phosphates shall not exceed the maximum level for E 338 - 452\u2019\n(d) In category 07.1 \u2018Bread and rolls\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 338 - 452:\n\u2018E 450 (ix) Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate 15\u00a0000 (4)(81) Only pizza dough (frozen or chilled) and \u201ctortilla\u201d\u00a0\u2019\n(e) In category 07.2 \u2018Fine bakery ware\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 338 - 452:\n\u2018E 450 (ix) Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate 15\u00a0000 (4)(81)\n(81) the total amount of phosphates shall not exceed the maximum level for E 338 - 452\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0E 450 (ix) is not included\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, the following entry is inserted after the specifications for food additive E 450 (vii):\n\u2018E 450(ix) MAGNESIUM DIHYDROGEN DIPHOSPHATE\nSynonyms Acid magnesium pyrophosphate, monomagnesium dihydrogen pyrophosphate; magnesium diphosphate, magnesium pyrophosphate\nDefinition Magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate is the acidic magnesium salt of diphosphoric acid. It is manufactured by adding an aqueous dispersion of magnesium hydroxide slowly to phosphoric acid, until a molar ratio about 1:2 between Mg and P is reached. The temperature is held under 60\u00a0\u00b0C during the reaction. About 0,1\u00a0% hydrogen peroxide is added to the reaction mixture and the slurry is then heated and milled.\nEINECS 244-016-8\nChemical name Mono magnesium dihydrogen diphosphate\nChemical formula MgH2P2O7\nMolecular Weight 200,25\nAssay P2O5 content not less than 68,0\u00a0% and not more than 70,5\u00a0% expressed as P2O5\nDescription White crystals or powder\nIdentification\nSolubility Slightly soluble in water, practically insoluble in ethanol\nParticle size: The average particle size will deviate between 10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcm\nPurity\nLoss on ignition Not more than 12\u00a0% (800\u00a0\u00b0C, 0,5 hours)\nFluoride Not more than 20\u00a0mg/kg (expressed as fluorine)\nAluminium Not more than 50\u00a0mg/kg\nArsenic Not more than 1\u00a0mg/kg\nCadmium Not more than 1\u00a0mg/kg.\nLead Not more than 1\u00a0mg/kg\u2019"}
