These objections were deemed admissible under points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) Germany\u2019s objection referred in particular to the concern that the registration of \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 as a protected geographical indication would adversely affect other products that have been placed lawfully on the market for at least five years and sold as Balsamessig/Aceto balsamico, as well as to the alleged generic character of these terms. Germany also pointed to the lack of clarity regarding the stages of production which must take place in the area of origin.\n(4) France\u2019s objection concerned the fact that \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 does not have its own reputation that is distinct from that of \u2018Aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena\u2019, which has already been registered as a protected designation of origin under Council Regulation (EC) No 813/2000\u00a0(3). France claims that consumers could be misled as to the nature and origin of the product in question.\n(5) Greece stressed the importance of balsamic vinegar production in Greece, which is marketed under names such as \u2018balsamico\u2019 or \u2018balsamon\u2019 and the negative impact that registration of the name \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 would have on these products, which have been placed lawfully on the market for at least five years. Greece also maintains that the terms \u2018aceto balsamico\u2019, \u2018balsamic\u2019, etc. are generic.\n(6) By letters dated 4 March 2008, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.\n(7) Given that no agreement was reached between France, Germany, Greece and Italy within the designated timeframe, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.\n(8) The Commission has requested the opinion of the scientific committee for designations of origin, geographical indications and certificates of specific character established under Decision 93/53/EC\u00a0(4) as to whether the conditions for registration were met. The committee stated in its unanimous opinion submitted on 6 March 2006 that the name \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 has an undeniable reputation on the national and international market, as demonstrated by its frequent use in numerous recipes in many Member States, and the many references to it on the Internet, in the press and other media. \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 therefore meets the inherent condition for the product having a specific reputation linked to that name. The committee noted the fact that these products have co-existed on the market for hundreds of years. It also noted that \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 and \u2018Aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena\u2019 are different as regards their characteristics, customer base, usage, method of distribution, presentation and price, thereby ensuring the fair treatment of the producers in question and not misleading consumers. The Commission fully concurs with these points.\n(9) In order to further distinguish between these products, it has been pointed out that numerical qualifiers were included in the general ban on using terms other than those expressly provided for in the technical specifications. Moreover, a number of minor changes have been made to the technical specifications for the term \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 aimed at removing any ambiguities.\n(10) It appears that Germany and Greece did not refer to the entire name, i.e. \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 in their objections regarding the generic nature of the name proposed for registration, but only to some elements of it, namely the words \u2018aceto\u2019, \u2018balsamico\u2019 and \u2018aceto balsamico\u2019, or to translations thereof. However, protection is granted to the term \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 as a whole. Individual non-geographical components of that term may be used, even jointly and also in translation, throughout the Community, provided the principles and rules applicable in the Community\u2019s legal order are respected.\n(11) In the light of the above, the name \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 should be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["The name contained in Annex I to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.", "A consolidated version of the summary containing the main points of the specification is set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a093, 31.3.2006, p.\u00a012.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0152, 6.7.2007, p.\u00a018.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0100, 20.4.2000, p.\u00a05.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a013, 21.1.1993, p.\u00a016.\nANNEX I\nAgricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty:\nClass 1.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other products listed in Annex I to the Treaty (spices, etc.)\nITALY\nAceto Balsamico di Modena (PGI)\nANNEX II\nSUMMARY\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin of agricultural products and foodstuffs\n\u2018ACETO BALSAMICO DI MODENA\u2019\nEC No: IT-PGI-0005-0430-18.11.2004\nPDO (\u00a0)\u00a0PGI (X)\nThis summary sets out the main elements of the product specification for information purposes.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsible department in the Member State:\nName : Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali\nAddress : Via XX Settembre, 20 \u2014 00187 Roma\nTel. : 06-4819968\nFax : 06-42013126\nE-mail : qualita@politicheagricole.it\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Group\nName : Consorzio Aceto Balsamico di Modena Soc.

This, along with the compilation of specific lists managed by the body that inspects the land registry parcels on which the vines are located, growers, must producers, processors and bottlers, as well as timely notification to the inspection body of the quantities produced, packaged and labelled, ensures product traceability. All natural and legal persons recorded in these lists may be subject to checks by the inspection body, as provided for in the production specification and the monitoring programme.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\n\u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 is obtained from grape must that is partially fermented and/or boiled and/or concentrated by adding a quantity of vinegar aged for at least 10 years and with the addition of at least 10\u00a0% of vinegar produced from the acidification of wine only. The percentage of boiled and/or concentrated grape must should not be less than 20\u00a0% of the volume sent for processing. The concentration increases until the initial amount of must attains a density of at least 1,240 at a temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIn order to ensure that \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 acquires the properties described in point 4.2, the grape must has to be produced from the following vine varieties: Lambrusco, Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Albana, Ancellotta, Fortana and Montuni.

The receptacles in which \u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 is released for direct consumption must be made of glass, wood, ceramic or terracotta with the following capacity: 0,250 l, 0,500 l, 0,750 l, 1 l, 2 l, 3 l or 5 l; or in single-dose sachets of a maximum capacity of 25 ml made of plastic or composite materials, bearing the same wording as that on the labels of the bottles. Receptacles made from glass, wood, ceramic or terracotta with a capacity of 5 litres or more, or plastic bottles with a capacity of 2 litres or more are allowed, however, if the product is intended for professional use. The assembly of raw materials, processing, refining and ageing in wood receptacles must take place in the geographical area of origin. The product may be packaged outside the area specified in point 4.3.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\n\u2018Aceto Balsamico di Modena\u2019 has an excellent reputation on both the national and international markets, amply demonstrated by its frequent use in countless recipes and the many references to it on the Internet, in the press and in the other media.
