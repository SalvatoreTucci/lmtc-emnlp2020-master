The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping of the product and of resulting material injury that was sufficient to justify the initiation.\n(3) The Commission informed the complainant, other known Union producers, the known exporting producers in the PRC, possible analogue country producers, known importers, distributors, and other parties known to be concerned, and representatives of the PRC of the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.\n(4) The complainant, other Union producers, the exporting producers in the PRC, importers and distributors made their views known. All interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(5) By a letter of 9 September 2013 to the Commission, the complainant withdrew its complaint.\n(6) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, a proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(7) The investigation has not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would be against the Union interest. Therefore, the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. No comments were received.\n(8) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or steel, of an external diameter exceeding 406,4\u00a0mm, originating in the PRC, should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of seamless pipes and tubes of iron or steel, other than of stainless steel, of circular cross-section, of an external diameter exceeding 406,4\u00a0mm, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes 7304\u00a019\u00a090, 7304\u00a029\u00a090, 7304\u00a039\u00a098 and 7304\u00a059\u00a099, is terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 45, 16.2.2013, p. 3."}
