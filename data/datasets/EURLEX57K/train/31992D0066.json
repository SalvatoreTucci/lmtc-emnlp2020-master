The planning of the measures for the development and rationalization of aquaculture production corresponding to the investments provided for in the Annex hereto shall be carried out with due regard for the priorities set by the various  Regulations governing the Community structural policies.\n2. Special attention must be given during the implementation of the programme to the interaction between the development of the aquaculture sector and the environment and to the health conditions of fish farms and their products.\n3. Preference shall be given to investment projects to which the Member State applies rules favourable to the development of aquaculture and protected marine areas.\n4. Preference shall be given to innovative projects based on adequate research work and ensuring in the long term the diversification of production.\n5. The production objectives of the programme must be checked at regular intervals and adjusted, if necessary, in line with the development of the market for fishery and aquaculture products.", "The Commission shall inform the Member State, if necessary, within six months following 1 April each year, of the failure to comply with the conditions to which approval of the programme was made subject, on the basis of an examination of the  periodic summary reports provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86, or in the absence thereof.", "The Commission draws attention to the fact that the investment estimates contained in this programme are without prejudice to any financial aid the Community may grant.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 1991.

On that basis, the socio-economic objectives are  to:\n- exploit natural resources,\n- supply the market deficit,\n- diversify production,\n- absorb surplus labour in the fisheries sector,\n- change of fishing shellfish ('marisqueo'),\n- strengthen the policies for the protection of the sea coast.\nMULTIANNUAL GUIDANCE PROGRAMME - PROTECTED MARINE AREAS SPAIN\nRegions/locations\nThe entire coastal area of Spain and the islands.\nEnvironment\nProtection of marine ecosystems of interest to fisheries.\nLegislative aspects/funding of investments\nInstallation of 78 artificial reefs representing a total investment of ECU 34,2 million.\nPriorities/objectives\n- Development priorities\n- artificial reefs ad hoc,\n- artificial reefs formed from the timber in fishing vessel hulls,\n- marine reservations.\n- Overall objectives\n- to protect certain areas with the aim of preventing over exploitation (trawling, for example),\n- to establish restocking areas,\n- to establish various habitats which will allow an increase in natural production,\n- to encourage non-industrial fishing in the areas surrounding reefs."}
