Those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2738/1999 of 21 December 1999 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted(4).\n(2) Pursuant to Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the Member States were authorised by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1163/1999(5) to pay an initial advance and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2163/1999(6) to pay a second advance to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers. The definitive premiums to be paid in respect of the 1999 marketing year must thus be fixed.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the premium payable to producers of heavy lambs in respect of the 1999 marketing year is obtained by multiplying the loss of income by a coefficient expressing the annual average production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs, expressed per 100 kg of carcass weight. In accordance with the abovementioned Regulation, the premium per ewe for producers of light lambs and per female of the caprine species should be 80 % of the premium for producers of heavy lambs.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in Article 13(2) of that Regulation. That coefficient is fixed at 7 % by Article 13(4) of the said Regulation.\n(5) It is opportune to foresee that the aid provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1323/90 of 14 May 1990 instituting specific aid for sheep and goat farming in certain less-favoured areas of the Community(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 193/98(8), or the balance of this aid, resulting from the application of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1163/1999, should be granted before a certain date and under what conditions.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application of specific measures relating to agricultural production in the Canary Islands. Those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the premium payable to producers of light lambs and she goats on the same conditions as those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98. Those conditions provide for Spain to be authorised to pay the supplement to the premium.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["It is hereby noted that the difference between the basic price less the impact of the coefficient provided for in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and the Community market price during the 1999 marketing year was EUR 138,169 per 100 kilograms.", "The coefficient provided for in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 is hereby fixed at 15,69 kilograms.", "1.
