Those bivalve molluscs may be intended for human consumption after having undergone, after processing, a test lot by lot to verify that they do not contain a PSP level detectable by the bioassay method.\n(5) Morocco has also bivalve molluscs of the species Acanthocardia tuberculatum resources with a level of PSP in the edible parts of more than 80 \u03bcg per 100 g but less than 300 \u03bcg per 100 g.\n(6) Morocco has provided guarantees regarding the application of the conditions laid down in Decision 96/77/EC, to bivalve molluscs of the species Acanthocardia tuberculatum.\n(7) Imports from Morocco of processed and canned bivalve molluscs of the species Acanthocardia tuberculatum harvested and processed in accordance with conditions fulfilling the health requirements laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC and the harvesting and processing conditions laid down in Decision 96/77/EC should be authorised.\n(8) Decision 95/30/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 95/30/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
