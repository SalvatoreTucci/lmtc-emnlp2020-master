It is also still collecting data on the samples supplied by the Member States and tested in Community comparative trials.\n(3) Current international practices including those adopted by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) continue to permit temporary experiments on seed sampling and seed testing.\n(4) Consequently the temporary experiment should be extended and Decision 98/320/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["In Article 4 of Decision 98/320/EC the date \"30 June 2002\" is replaced by the date \"31 July 2004\".", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 April 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2290/66.\n(2) OJ L 25, 1.2.1999, p. 27.\n(3) OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2298/66.\n(4) OJ L 234, 1.9.2001, p. 60.\n(5) OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2309/66.\n(6) OJ L 169, 10.7.1969, p. 3.\n(7) OJ L 140, 12.5.1998, p. 14."}
