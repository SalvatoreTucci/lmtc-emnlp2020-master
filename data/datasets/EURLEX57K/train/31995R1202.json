The following subparagraph is inserted after point 1 of the 'Plants and plant products` section  of Annex I:\n'In particular, the conversion period may be reduced to the strict minimum by a Member State in  situations where the parcels have been treated with a product not included in Annex II, part B as  part of a pest or disease control scheme made mandatory by the competent authority of the Member  State on its territory or on certain parts of its territory in respect of a specific crop.\nThe reduction in the conversion period must take account of all the following points:\n-  the parcels were already converted or were undergoing conversion to organic farming,\n-  the degradation of the plant protection product concerned must result in an insignificant level  of residue in the soil and, where the latter is a perennial crop, in the crop,\n-  the Member State concerned must notify the other Member States of its decision concerning the  obligation of treatment and also the level of the reduction decided for the conversion period,\n-  products of the harvest following treatment may not be sold bearing an indication referring to  organic production.` 2.  Point 9 of part A of Annex III is replaced by the following:\n'9.  Where an operator runs several production units in the same area producing crops or crop  products not covered by Article 1 together with storage premises for input products (such as  fertilizers, plant protection products, seed) must also be subject to the inspection arrangements  as regards the first subparagraph of point 2 and points 3 and 4. Crops of the same variety as those  produced at the unit referred to in point 1 may not be produced at these units.\nHowever, producers may derogate from the rule referred to in the last sentence of the preceding  subparagraph:\n(a)  in the case of the production of perennial crop products (fruit growing, vines and hops)  provided the following conditions are met:\n1.  the production in question forms part of a conversion plan in respect of which the producer  gives a firm undertaking and which provides for the beginning of the conversion of the last part of  the area concerned to organic production in the shortest possible period which may not in any event  exceed a maximum of five years,\n2.  appropriate measures have been taken to ensure the permanent separation of the products  obtained from each unit concerned,\n3.  the inspection body or authority is notified of the harvest of each of the products concerned  at least 48 hours in advance,\n4.  immediately upon completion of the harvest, the producer informs the inspection body or  authority of the exact quantities harvested on the units concerned together with any particular  distinguishing features (such as quality, colour, average weight, etc.) and confirms that the  measures taken to separate the products have been applied,\n5.  the conversion plan and the measures referred to in points 1 and 2 have been approved by the  inspection body or authority. This approval must be confirmed each year after the start of the  conversion plan;\n(b)  in the case of areas intended for agricultural research agreed by the Member States' competent  authorities, provided that conditions 2, 3 and 4 and the relevant part of condition 5 referred to  in (a) are met;\n(c)  in the case of production of seed, vegetative propagating material and transplants, provided  that conditions 2, 3 and 4 and the relevant part of condition 5 referred to in (a) are met.`"}
