Preference shall be given to investment projects to which the Member State applies rules favourable to the development of aquaculture and protected marine areas.\n4. Preference shall be given to innovative projects based on adequate research work and ensuring in the long term the diversification of production.\n5. The production objectives of the programme must be checked at regular intervals and adjusted, if necessary, in line with the development of the market for fishery and aquaculture products.\n6.

Estimated overall investment in the next programme amounts to between ECU 71 and 100 million.\nMarket\nMainly domestic and Community markets with exports to non-member countries (USA, Japan).\nIncreased investment in the promotion and marketing of aquaculture products.\nOpening up of new market segments and development of new products.\nPriorities/objectives\nTo increase the range of species farmed by developing new species (turbot, halibut, tilapia, freshwater crayfish, wrasse) and the range of products obtained from aquaculture.\nTo improve infrastructure.\nTo promote environmental protection.\nTo step up marketing operations.\nTo encourage technical innovation.\nTo contribute to the socio-economic development of the more remote regions in conjunction with various national and Community programmes.\nTo raise health standards and product quality.\nTo increase efficiency in order to achieve improved adaptation to market conditions (operating at the level of labour, feed costs and the survival rate of fish and shellfish).\nTo secure the viability of the industry.\nIn the present state of the market in salmonidae, to give priority to modernizing and expanding existing units pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86.\nProtected marine areas\nIncreasing interest on the part of the industry shown by the feasibility studies being carried out (principally on lobster)."}
