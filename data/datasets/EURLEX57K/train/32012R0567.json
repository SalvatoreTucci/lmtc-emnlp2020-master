Given the large number of cooperating exporting producers in China in the investigation that led to the imposition of the anti-dumping duty (\u2018the original investigation\u2019), a sample of Chinese exporting producers was selected and individual duty rates ranging from 26,3\u00a0% to 36,5\u00a0% were imposed on the companies included in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample were attributed a duty rate of 30,6\u00a0%. A duty rate of 69,7\u00a0% was imposed on all other Chinese companies.\n(2) Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 stipulates that where any new exporting producer in China provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that:\n\u2014 it did not export to the Union the products described in Article 1(1) of that Regulation during the investigation period (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) (\u2018the investigation period\u2019) (the first criterion),\n\u2014 it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (the second criterion), and\n\u2014 it has actually exported to the Union the products concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Union (the third criterion),\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NEW EXPORTING PRODUCER REQUEST\n(3) A Chinese company (\u2018the applicant\u2019) has applied to be granted the same treatment as the companies cooperating in the original investigation not included in the sample (\u2018new exporting producer treatment\u2019).\n(4) An examination has been carried out to determine whether the applicant fulfils the criteria for being granted new exporting producer treatment as set out in Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011.\n(5) A questionnaire was sent to the applicant who was asked to supply evidence to demonstrate that it met the three criteria mentioned above.\n(6) The evidence provided by the Chinese exporting producer was considered sufficient to show that it fulfils the criteria set out in Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011. This exporting producer can therefore be granted the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 30,6\u00a0%) and consequently its name can be added to the list of exporting producers in Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011.\n(7) The applicant and the Union industry have been informed of the findings of the examination and were given the opportunity to submit their comments.\n(8) All arguments and submissions made by interested parties were analysed and duly taken into account where warranted,", "main_body": ["The following company shall be added to the list of producers from the People\u2019s Republic of China listed in Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011:\n\u2018Name TARIC additional code\nOnna Ceramic Industries (China) Co.
