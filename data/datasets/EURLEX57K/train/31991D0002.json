Aid to cover operating losses of the 'Carbonifera do Douro' undertaking totalling Esc 796 400 000 for production of  about 0,22 million tonnes is submitted for the approval of the Commission under the abovementioned Decision.\nII\nThe increase in aid compared with 1988 must be viewed in the light of the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, in particular those of Article 2 (1) thereof.\nFor several years, the 'Carbonifera do Douro' undertaking has been implementing a modernization and rationalization plan which has led to some improvement in productivity. However, this has not been fully reflected in the production costs owing to the  increase in the cost of certain production factors, such as salaries.\nThe aid will cover the difference between projected average costs and projected average revenue for each tonne produced. The aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence complies with the conditions of Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nThe purpose of the aid is to prevent premature closure of the pit and forms part of a regional industrial diversification policy designed to create new employment outside the coal industry. It hence contributes to solving the social and regional  problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1).\nIII\nIn view of the temporary nature of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC which expires on 31 December 1993, and the need to ensure the economic viability of the Community's coal industry in the long term, Community aid must be scheduled on a declining scale.\nTo enable the Commission to check whether the conditions of application of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC are fulfilled, Portugal should be requested to submit, by 31 December 1990, information relating to the business strategy of the undertaking 'Carbonifera  do Doura'.\nIn view of the above and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities, the aid to be granted to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry in 1989 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and with the proper  functioning of the common market.\nIV\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it authorizes is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof. It must therefore be informed of  the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["     Article 1\nPortugal is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Esc 796 400 000 to the coal industry to cover operating losses for the 1989 calendar year.
