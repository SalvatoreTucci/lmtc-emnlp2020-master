There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live birds other than poultry, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds).\n(2) Following the outbreak of avian influenza, caused by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strain, in south-eastern Asia starting in December 2003, the Commission adopted several protection measures in relation to avian influenza. Those measures included in particular Commission Decision 2005/759/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries and the movement from third countries of birds accompanying their owners\u00a0(5) and Commission Decision 2005/760/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries for the import of captive birds\u00a0(6).\n(3) Since new cases of avian influenza have been reported in certain member countries of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the restrictions concerning the movements of pet birds and imports of other birds from certain areas at risk should be continued. Therefore it is appropriate to extend the application of Decisions 2005/759/EC and 2005/760/EC.\n(4) Decisions 2005/759/EC and 2005/760/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 5 of Decision 2005/759/EC \u201831 January 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 May 2006\u2019.", "In Article 6 of Decision 2005/760/EC \u201831 January 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 May 2006\u2019.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
