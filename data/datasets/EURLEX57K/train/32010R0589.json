The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with consultations with Norway pursuant to the provisions of the agreed record of conclusions of fisheries consultations between the European Commission and Norway of 26 January 2010. In consequence, the European Union share of that part of the TAC that can be caught in EU waters of ICES zones IIa and IV should be fixed at 90\u00a0% of 400\u00a0000 tonnes.\n(5) Following negotiations with Norway, the amount allocated to Norway from the EU\u2019s share of the TAC should be increased from 20\u00a0000 tonnes to 27\u00a0500 tonnes in exchange for fishing opportunities on other species in Norwegian waters.\n(6) The Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries recommends that the TAC should be increased by 4,23\u00a0% to cover EU waters of ICES zone IIIa.\n(7) Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 53/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IA to Regulation (EU) No 53/2010 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 July 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a021, 26.1.2010, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nAnnex IA to Regulation (EU) No 53/2010 is amended as follows:\nThe entry concerning the species sandeel in EU waters of IIIa and EU waters of IIa and IV is replaced by the following:\nSpecies : Sandeel\nZone : EU waters of IIIa, EU waters of IIa and IV\u00a0(1)\nSpecies : Sandeel\nZone : EU waters of IIIa, EU waters of IIa and IV\u00a0(1)\nDenmark 327\u00a0250\u00a0(2)\nUnited Kingdom 7\u00a0153\u00a0(3)\nGermany 500\u00a0(4)\nSweden 12\u00a0017\u00a0(5)\nEU 346\u00a0920\u00a0(6) Analytical TAC.\nNorway 27\u00a0500\u00a0(7)\nFaeroes 2\u00a0500\nTAC 376\u00a0920"}
