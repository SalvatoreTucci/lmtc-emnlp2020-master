It is also intended to seek further specific advice.\n(6) Pending such advice, it is appropriate to provide transitional measures allowing the continued placing on the market, export, import and transit of certain products classified as Category 1 and 2 materials under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, intended exclusively for technical uses.\n(7) Accordingly, transitional measures should be adopted to allow the technical use of certain, strictly defined, Category 1 and 2 materials. The specific uses of such materials intended for technical purposes should be subject to strict channelling and control measures, further reducing the risk of diversion into the food and feed chains and unintended use in other technical products such as fertilisers and soil improvers, cosmetics, medicinal products and medical devices.\n(8) Where the use of Category 1 and 2 animal by-products cannot be avoided for the production of medicinal products, the competent authority may, on the basis of an appropriate case-by-case risk assessment in accordance with relevant Community legislation, derogate from the provisions of the Regulation\n(9) With regard to the placing on the market and export of animal by-products intended for a technical use produced in the Community, the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should be generally sufficient, subject to complementing the rules for collection and transport to ensure the strict channelling, identification, and control objectives being pursued; with regard to consignments for imports or in transit, additional certification and channelling requirements should be implemented.\n(10) Member States should implement additional verification arrangements as necessary for the implementation of this Regulation and in particular to avoid the risk of diversion, and should cooperate to that effect; they should inform the Commission and other Member States accordingly, and take all necessary measures in the context of the relevant Community legislation in case of non compliance.\n(11) In order to avoid disruption of trade it is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the continuing acceptance of imported animal by-products arriving at the border inspection posts after 1 May 2004, and which may still be accompanied by old models of health certificates.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to the following animal by-products, classified as Category 1 or Category 2 material under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 and intended exclusively for technical uses:\n(a) hides and skins derived from animals which have been treated with certain substances which are prohibited pursuant to Directive 96/22/EC(4);\n(b) rendered fats derived from Category 1 materials produced using Method 1 as referred to in Annex V, Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, and in the case rendered fats from ruminant animals have been purified so that the maximum level of remaining total insoluble impurities does not exceed 0,15 % in weight, and derived fat derivatives meeting at least the standards referred to in Annex VI, Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002;\n(c) ruminant intestines (with or without content); and\n(d) bone and bone products containing vertebral column and skulls, and bovine horns which have been removed from the skull using a method which left the cranial cavity intact.\nHowever, those animal by-products shall not be derived from animals referred to in Article 4(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002", "Derogation regarding the placing on the market and export of animal by-products\nBy way of derogation from Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the Member States may authorise the placing on the market and export of the animal by-products referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation (\"the animal by-products\").\nHowever, the derogation provided for in the first sub-paragraph shall not apply to the export of the animal by-products referred to in points (c) and (d) of Article 1 of this Regulation.", "Derogation regarding the importation and transit of animal by-products\nBy way of derogation from Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the Member States may authorise the importation and transit of the animal by-products.\nA label similar to that referred to in point (a) of Article 5 of this Regulation shall also be required for the imported animal by-products.", "Conditions for the placing on the market, export and import of the animal by-products\n1.
