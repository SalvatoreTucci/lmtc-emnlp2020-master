In addition, Shellac (E 904) can contribute to a better preservation of all unpeeled boiled eggs when used on their surface.\n(6) Those food additives are not expected to migrate into the internal edible part of the eggs due to their insolubility and to their high molecular weight. The use of those food additives is not liable to have an effect on human health as their waxes remain on the egg shell. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of Talc (E 553b) and Carnauba wax (E 903) on unpeeled coloured boiled eggs and the use of Shellac (E 904) on all unpeeled boiled eggs, coloured as well as non-coloured.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of Talc (E 553b), Carnauba wax (E 903) and Shellac (E 904) on unpeeled boiled eggs constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(3), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of Talc (E 553b) and Carnauba wax (E 903) on unpeeled coloured boiled eggs and the use of Shellac (E 904) on unpeeled boiled eggs before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to those food additives.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entries are inserted in the food category 10.2 \u2018Processed eggs and egg products\u2019 after the entry for E 520-523:\n\u2018E 553b Talc 5\u00a0400  only on the surface of unpeeled coloured boiled eggs Period of application:\nE 903 Carnauba wax 3\u00a0600  only on the surface of unpeeled coloured boiled eggs Period of application:\nE 904 Shellac quantum satis  only on the surface of unpeeled boiled eggs Period of application:"}
