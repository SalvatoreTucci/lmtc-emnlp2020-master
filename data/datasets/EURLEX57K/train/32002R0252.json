Export options have thus been seriously restricted.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to limit the adverse impact on exporters by allowing them, notwithstanding Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, to cancel export licences which they can prove they are unable to use.\n(5) This measure should benefit only operators who can show on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(8), that they have in the circumstances been unable to export and that, in particular, their licences were requested in order to export to the third countries that have adopted restrictive health measures.\n(6) Given the way in which the situation has evolved, this Regulation should be brought into force immediately.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
