The Commission has published in the Official Journal successive lists of bicycle assemblers\u00a0(4) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(2) Following the last publication of the list of parties under examination\u00a0(5), a period of examination has been selected. This period was defined as from 1 January 2007 to 31 May 2009. A questionnaire was sent to all parties under examination, requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nA.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceptablerequests for exemption\n(3) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. These parties had already received their suspension with effect from the day of arrival of a first complete application dossier at the Commission premises. The newly requested and provided information was examined and verified, where necessary, at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nMADIROM PROD SRL Bucuresti, Sector 6, Splaiul Independentei no. 319, OB. 152 Romania A896\nRose Versand GmbH Schersweide 4, 46395 Bocholt Germany A897\nWinora Staiger GmbH Max-Planck-Strasse 6, 97526 Sennfeld Germany A894\n(4) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that for all of these applicants' bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People's Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60\u00a0% of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations, and they, therefore, fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(5) For this reason, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, the parties listed in the above table should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty.\n(6) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation, the exemption of the parties listed in table 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.\nA.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unacceptable request for exemption\n(7) The party listed in table 2 below also submitted a request for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nCITIC \u2013 MARMES BICYCLE CZ, s.r.o. \u017dichl\u00ednsk\u00e9 P\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed, Albrechtick\u00e1 391, 56301 Lan\u0161kroun Czech Republic A891\n(8) This party did not submit a questionnaire reply.\n(9) Since the party listed in table 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption set by Article 6(2) of the exemption Regulation, the Commission has to reject its request for exemption, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Regulation. In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the request submitted by this party.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nB.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admissible requests for exemption for which suspension should be granted\n(10) Interested parties are hereby informed of the receipt of further requests for exemption, pursuant to Article 3 of the exemption Regulation, from parties listed in table 3.
