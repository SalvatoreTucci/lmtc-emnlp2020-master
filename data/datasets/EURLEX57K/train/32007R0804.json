Therefore, the fishing opportunities for the said stock allocated to Poland for 2007 are deemed to be exhausted.\n(4) According to Article 21(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 Poland has the obligation to provisionally prohibit, as from the date on which its catch quota in question is deemed to be exhausted, the fishing for that stock, the retention on board, the transhipment and the landing of fish taken after that date.\n(5) In the absence of appropriate action taken by Poland, it is necessary that the Commission fixes, at its own initiative, the moment on which the catches by vessels flying the flag of Poland of cod in the Baltic Sea (Subdivisions 25-32, EC-waters) are deemed to have exhausted the quota for Poland, and to immediately prohibit fishing for that stock as from that date.
