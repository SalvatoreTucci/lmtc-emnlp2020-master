Article 7(2) of that Regulation, concerning securities, enables operators to avoid forfeiture of the security whenever importers are able to produce a new import licence drawn under the barley quota administered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2376/2002(7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 539/2003(8).\n(2) Given that such a possibility raises several practical difficulties at the level of customs and creates opportunities for undue use of the tariff-quota in question, it is appropriate to abolish the provision.\n(3) In order to solve practical difficulties in customs treatment of imports of malting barley in cases where certificates of conformity are provided, it is necessary to amend the provisions of that Regulation concerning the certification procedure for malting barley.\n(4) In the framework of the common wheat and barley tariff quota, it is important to harmonize the dates of application in all Member States in case of national holidays. The same provisions should be made applicable for the malting barley tariff quota as well.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2377/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2377/2002 is amended as follows:\n1.
