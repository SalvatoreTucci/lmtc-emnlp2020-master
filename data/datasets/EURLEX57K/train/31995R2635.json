The import document referred to in paragraph 1 above is issued automatically, free of charge  and for any quantity requested within a maximum of five working days following receipt of a  declaration addressed to the competent national authorities by any Community importer, regardless  of his place of business in the Community.\n3.

The import document  shall be valid through the whole Community customs territory and can be used for a period of six  months as from the issuing date as long as the import regime of liberalization applicable to the  products concerned remains in force.\n4.  The Member States shall notify the Commission of the amounts of the requests for import  authorizations which they have received as well as of the amounts, base cif at the Community  borders, of the products listed in Annex I put into free circulation as from the date of entry into  force of this Regulation.
