To implement that administrative assistance, the Commission, represented by the European Anti-Fraud Office (hereinafter referred to as \"OLAF\"), and the Russian authorities have concluded an arrangement establishing a mechanism for the communication of information on movements of goods between the Community and the Russian Federation.\n(2) As part of that administrative assistance, Regulation (EC) No 2584/2000(4) laid down, specifically in relation to the transport by road of beef, veal and pigmeat products bound for the Russian Federation, the information which operators must forward to the competent authorities of the Member States and the system for communicating that information between the competent authorities of the Member States, OLAF and the Russian authorities.\n(3) That information and the system of communication introduced will make it possible to trace exports of the products concerned to the Russian Federation and, where appropriate, detect cases in which a refund is not due and must be recovered.\n(4) In view of the success of the system introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2584/2000, the system for the communication of information should be extended to exports of the products concerned by any type of transport, a means should be devised to enable the exporter to specify more precisely the type of transport employed and a legal value should be conferred on the information obtained through this system.\n(5) Article 16(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/2002(6), specifies that the Commission may provide in certain specific cases for proof of import to be furnished by specific documents or in some other way.
