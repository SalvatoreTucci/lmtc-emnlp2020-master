Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel bars originating in India should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel bars originating in India, currently falling within CN codes 7222\u00a020\u00a021, 7222\u00a020\u00a029, 7222\u00a020\u00a031, 7222\u00a020\u00a039, 7222\u00a020\u00a081 and 7222\u00a020\u00a089, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 March 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 87 A, 1.4.2010, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 87, 1.4.2010, p. 17."}
