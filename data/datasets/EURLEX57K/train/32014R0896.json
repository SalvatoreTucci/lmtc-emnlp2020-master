This would increase by 4,4 % the overall TAC for 2014 proposed by the other coastal States under the existing long-term management plan.\n(4) According to the most recent scientific advice, the estimated effect of this increase in catch in 2014 on the biomass of herring by the beginning of 2015 would only be 0,4 %, a figure that can be considered non-significant in terms of conservation of the stock.\n(5) The corrective measure adopted by the Faroe Islands, when taken together with the shares adopted jointly by the other coastal States, i.e. Russian Federation, Norway, Iceland and the Union, will not therefore undermine the conservation efforts agreed between the EU and the other coastal States.\n(6) As a consequence, the measures adopted by the Commission under Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 should cease to apply in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1026/2012. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 should thus be repealed.\n(7) As continuing the application of those measures is not required, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.\n(8) This is without prejudice to the future quotas to be set by the Faroe Islands or to the forthcoming coastal state consultations on the joint management of Atlanto-Scandian herring.\n(9) The Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture did not deliver an opinion,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0316, 14.11.2012, p.\u00a034.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0223, 21.8.2013, p.\u00a01."}
