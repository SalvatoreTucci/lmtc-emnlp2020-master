The measures related to pallets, boxes and dunnage align Community measures with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No 15 on \u2018Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade\u2019 which was adopted in March 2002 by the Fourth Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (ICPM).\n(3) Standard No 15 describes that wood packaging (including dunnage) made of coniferous and non-coniferous raw wood, should be subjected to approved measures such as heat treatment (56\u00a0\u00b0C for a minimum of 30 minutes) or fumigation with Methyl Bromide. Moreover the wood should display a specified mark to certify that the wood has been subjected to an approved measure.\n(4) The Standard also provides that countries may require that imported wood packaging material subjected to an approved measure be made from debarked wood and display a mark subject to \u2018technical justification\u2019.\n(5) Third countries have requested that the Community consider alternative methods of achieving the same goal. To this end, research is under way on technical aspects of debarking wood, in particular the efficiency of \u2018pest risk reduction\u2019 of debarking in addition to treatment measures.\n(6) While awaiting the results of that research, it is appropriate to postpone for debarked wood, the application of the requirement to be used.\n(7) Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The Standing Committee on Plant Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Directive 2000/29/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
