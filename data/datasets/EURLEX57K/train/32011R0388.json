Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Maduramicin ammonium alpha, CAS number 84878-61-5, was authorised for 10 years in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3) and for use on turkeys by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2380/2001\u00a0(4). That additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of maduramicin ammonium alpha as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 9 December 2010 that, under the proposed conditions of use, maduramicin ammonium alpha does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that that additive is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens for fattening\u00a0(5). The Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of maduramicin ammonium alpha shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the provisions on maduramicin ammonium alpha in Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 should be deleted.\n(7) Since the modifications on the conditions of the authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the premixtures and compound feed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019 is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999, the entry under the registration number of additive E 770, concerning Maduramicin ammonium alpha is deleted.", "Premixtures and compound feed containing maduramicin ammonium alpha labelled in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 321, 6.12.2001, p. 18.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(1):1952.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive (trade name) Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive Composition\nActive substance\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1)\n1.
