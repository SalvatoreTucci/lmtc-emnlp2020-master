The Commission has received information about both chemicals in the form of a single decision guidance document. Both chemicals are severely restricted at Community level since their use as anti-knock agents in petrol is effectively banned, subject to minor exemptions, by Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC\u00a0(4). An import decision should therefore be taken accordingly.\n(5) The chemical parathion has also been added to the PIC procedure, as a pesticide, for which the Commission has received information from the Secretariat in the form of a decision guidance document.\n(6) Parathion falls within the scope of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market\u00a0(5). By Commission Decision 2001/520/EC of 9 July 2001 concerning the non-inclusion of parathion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance\u00a0(6), parathion was excluded from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and authorisations for plant protection products containing it had to be withdrawn by 8 January 2002. Parathion had previously been included in the interim PIC procedure to the extent that certain severely hazardous pesticide formulations containing parathion were listed in Annex III to the Convention, which was reflected in the response form set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2000/657/EC of 16 October 2000 adopting Community import decisions for certain chemicals pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals\u00a0(7). The entry for parathion in Annex III to the Convention needs to be replaced by an entry covering parathion in all its forms. A new import decision should therefore be taken.\n(7) Decision 2000/657/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision on the import of the chemical tetraethyl lead, as set out on the form for importing country responses in Annex I, is adopted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision on the import of the chemical tetramethyl lead, as set out on the form for importing country responses in Annex II, is adopted.", "The decision on the import of parathion as set out in the Annex to Decision 2000/657/EC is replaced by the import decision set out on the form for importing country responses in Annex III to this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, p. 1.
