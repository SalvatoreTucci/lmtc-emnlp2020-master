Where no tests are mentioned, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex.\nFunctional unit\nThe functional unit, to which inputs and outputs should be related, is:\n1 m2 of mattress\nA. ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\nA1. MATERIALS\nSpecific criteria are set in this section A1 for latex foam, polyurethane foam, wire and springs, coconut fibres and wood. Other materials for which no material-specific criteria are set are allowed. All of the materials used must comply with the criteria in section A2 on the use of dyes, pigments and flame retardants. The applicant shall supply detailed information as to the material composition of the mattresses.\nThe criteria specific for latex foam, polyurethane foam, or coconut fibres set in this section A1 need only be met if that material contributes to more than 5 % of the total weight of the mattress.\nLatex foam\n1. The concentrations in latex foam of the following substances must be less than the limit values indicated below:\n1(a) pentachlorophenol (its salts and esters): 0,1 ppm\nTest method: Milling of 5 g sample, extraction of PCP or sodium salt.\nAnalysis by means of gas chromatography (GC), detection with mass spectrometer or ECD.\n1(b) extractable heavy metals:\n>TABLE>\nTest method: Milled sample extracted according to DIN 38414-S4, L/S=10.\nFiltration with 0,45 \u00ecm membrane filter.\nAnalysis by means of atomic emission spectroscopy with inductive coupled plasma (ICP-AES) or with hydrid or cold vapour technique.\n1(c) extractable formaldehyde: 50 ppm\nTest method: According to Japan Law 112 (1973) or PRENISO 14184-1.\nSample of 1 g with 100 g water heated to 40 \u00b0C for one hour.\nFormaldehyde in extract analysed with acetylacetone, photometric.\n1(d) butadiene: 1 ppm\nTest method: Milling and weighing of sample.\nSampling by headspace sampler.\nAnalysis by gas chromatography, detection by flame-ionisation detector.\nPolyurethane (PUR) foam\n2. The concentrations in PUR foam of the following substances must be less than the limit values indicated below:\n2(a) extractable heavy metals:\n>TABLE>\nTest method: Milled sample extracted according to DIN 38414-S4, L/S=10.\nFiltration with 0,45 \u00ecm membrane filter.\nAnalysis by means of atomic emission spectroscopy with inductive coupled plasma (ICP-AES) or with hydrid or cold vapour technique.\n2(b) The concentration of tin (in organic form) must not exceed 900 ppm.\nTest method: Sample treatment according to NEN 6465 or ISO-DIS (draft international standard) 11466 or equivalent (grinding of sample, followed by treatment for two hours with boiling HCl/HNO3 (aqua regia)).\nAnalysis according to NEN 6465 or ISO-DIS (draft international standard) 11466 or equivalent, by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), cold vapour (CVAAS) for Hg; atomic emission spectroscopy with inductive coupled plasma (ICP-AES) for other heavy metals.\n3. CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs or methylene chloride shall not be used as blowing agents or as auxiliary blowing agents. The use of methylene chloride as an auxiliary blowing agent is nevertheless allowed in conjunction with the application of powdered flame retardants.\nWire and springs\n4. If degreasing and/or cleaning of wire and/or springs is carried out with organic solvents, use must be made of a closed cleaning/degreasing system.\n5. The surface of springs must not be covered with a galvanic metallic layer.\nCoconut fibres\n6. If the coconut fibre material is rubberised, the latex used must comply with the criteria applicable to latex foam.\nWooden material\n7. Any particle board used must be of class 1 quality with respect to formaldehyde as defined in EN 312-1.\nAny fibreboard used must be of class A quality with respect to formaldehyde as defined in EN 622-1.\nA2. CHEMICALS AND PREPARATIONS\nGlues\n8. Any glues used must contain less than 10 % by weight of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This criterion does not apply to glues used for occasional repairs.\nVOCs are any organic compound having at 293,15 K a vapour pressure of 0,01 kPa or more, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular conditions of use.\n9. Any glues used must be free of benzene and chlorobenzenes.\nDyes and pigments\n10. No azo dyes shall be used that may cleave to any of the following aromatic amines:\n>TABLE>\n11.

Solvent Yellow 1\nC.I. Solvent Yellow 2\nC.I. Solvent Yellow 3\nC.I. Basic Red 9\nC.I. Disperse Blue 1\n12. The following potentially sensitising dyes shall only be used if the fastness to perspiration (acid and alkaline) is at least 4:\nC.I. Disperse Blue 3\nC.I. Disperse Blue 35\nC.I. Disperse Blue 106\nC.I. Disperse Blue 124\nC.I. Disperse Yellow 3\nC.I. Disperse Orange 3\nC.I. Disperse Orange 37/76\nC.I. Disperse Red 1\nTest method: ISO 105-E04: Colour fastness to perspiration (acid and alkaline), minimum level 4. Testing only required if these dyes are used.\n13. No dyes or pigments shall be used that are based on chromium, copper, nickel or lead. Chrome mordant dyeing is not allowed.\n14. The levels of ionic impurities in the dyes used must not exceed the following:\n>TABLE>\n15. The levels of ionic impurities in the pigments used must not exceed the following:\n>TABLE>\nNB: All of the materials used in the mattress must comply with the criteria on dyes and pigments (criteria 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). Recycled materials used in the mattress may nevertheless contain the dyes and pigments excluded here, but only if added in the previous life-cycle of the material.\nFlame retardants\n16. No use is allowed of flame retardant substances or preparations containing substances that are classified or can be classified as dangerous for the environment according to Council Directive 67/548/EEC (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/69/EEC (4).\nNB: All of the materials used in the mattress must comply with this criterion. Recycled materials used in the mattress may nevertheless contain the flame retardants excluded here, but only if added in their previous life-cycle.\nB. FITNESS FOR USE CRITERIA\nDurability\n17. The loss of height must be less than 20 mm.\nThe loss of firmness (Hs) must be less than 20 %.\nTest method: prEN 1957 (final draft January 1997). The losses of height and firmness refer to the difference between the measurements made initially (at 100 cycles) and after the completion (30 000 cycles) of the durability test.\n(1) OJ 196, 16. 8. 1967, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 343, 13. 12. 1997, p. 19.\n(3) OJ 196, 16. 8. 1967, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 343, 13. 12. 1997, p. 19."}
