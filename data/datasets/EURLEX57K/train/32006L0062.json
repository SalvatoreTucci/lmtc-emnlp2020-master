Information relating to that use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and\u00a0is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.\n(3) For chlorfenvinphos it has been decided by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02076/2002\u00a0(7) not to\u00a0include that substance in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Certain Member States are allowed to maintain certain authorisations for the use of products containing chlorfenvinphos in force until 30\u00a0June 2007.\n(4) There are already Community MRLs for chlorfenvinphos in Directive 76/895/EEC. They should be taken into consideration when setting the MRLs for chlorfenvinphos in Directive 90/642/EEC.\n(5) The Commission review reports which were prepared for the inclusion in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and\u00a0if necessary, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for those substances. The exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substances concerned has been assessed in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organization\u00a0(8) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants\u00a0(9) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded.\n(6) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(7) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex\u00a0VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.\n(8) It is therefore necessary to add all of the MRLs arising from the use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and\u00a090/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and\u00a0control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. Where MRLs have not been defined until now, it is appropriate to set them for the first time.\n(9) Provisions of Directive 76/895/EEC which set MRLs for chlorfenvinphos should consequently be deleted.\n(10) Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and\u00a090/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex\u00a0II to Directive 76/895/EEC, the line for chlorfenvinphos is deleted.", "Annex\u00a0II to Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0I to this Directive.", "Annex\u00a0II to Directive 86/363/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0II to this Directive.", "Annex\u00a0II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0III to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 20\u00a0January 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to\u00a0comply with this Directive.
