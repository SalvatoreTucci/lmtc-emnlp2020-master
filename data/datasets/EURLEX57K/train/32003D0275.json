The Member State may take more stringent action in the field covered by this Directive if deemed necessary and proportionate to contain the disease, taking into account the particular epidemiological, animal husbandry, commercial and social conditions prevailing.\n(5) The Belgian authorities have in co-operation with the Commission, put in place a nation-wide standstill for transport of live poultry and hatching eggs, which includes a prohibition of dispatch of live poultry and hatching eggs to Member States and third countries. However, in view of the specificity of poultry production, movements of hatching eggs, day-old chicks, ready-to-lay pullets and poultry for immediate slaughter may be authorised within Belgium. Furthermore the dispatch to Member States and third countries of fresh, unprocessed manure and litter of poultry should also be prohibited.\n(6) Fresh poultry meat destined for intra-Community trade has to be marked with a health mark in accordance with the health mark foreseen in Chapter XII of Annex I of Directive 71/118/EEC(4), as last amended by Council Directive 97/79/EC(5).
