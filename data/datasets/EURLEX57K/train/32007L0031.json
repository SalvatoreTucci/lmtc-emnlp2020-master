Therefore, fosthiazate was included in Annex I to that Directive with the specific provisions that Member States may only authorise uses as nematicide.\n(3) In addition to the control of nematodes in certain agricultural uses, the notifier now has applied for an amendment to those specific provisions as regards the control of insects. In order to support such an extension of the use, the notifier submitted additional information.\n(4) The Netherlands and the United Kingdom evaluated the information and data submitted by the company. They informed the Commission in May and November 2006, respectively, that they conclude that the requested extension of use does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for fosthiazate in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. This is particularly the case since the extension only concerns the organisms controlled, but not the application parameters as set out in the specific provisions of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(5) Therefore it is justified to modify the specific provisions for fosthiazate.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 1 September 2007 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
