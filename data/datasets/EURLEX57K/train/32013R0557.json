The quality and the timeliness of available detailed information for research has, in this context, become an important component of a science-based understanding and governance of society.\n(4) The research community should, therefore, enjoy wider access to confidential data used for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, for analysis in the interest of scientific progress, without compromising the high level of protection that confidential statistical data require.\n(5) Bodies with the objective of promoting and providing access to data in the interest of scientific research in socially- and policy-relevant areas could contribute to the process of releasing confidential data for scientific purposes, thereby improving the accessibility of confidential data.\n(6) A risk management approach should be the most efficient model with a view to making a wider range of confidential data available for scientific purposes while preserving the confidentiality of respondents and statistical units.\n(7) The physical and logical protection of confidential data should be ensured by regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures. These measures should not be so excessive as to limit the utility of the data for the purpose of scientific research.\n(8) To this effect, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, Member States and the Commission should take appropriate measures to prevent and sanction any violations of statistical confidentiality.\n(9) This Regulation ensures, in particular, full respect for private and family life and for the protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union).\n(10) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2) and to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(11) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information\u00a0(4) and to Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies\u00a0(5).\n(12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community statistics, concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes\u00a0(6) should be repealed.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee (ESS Committee),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes the conditions under which access to confidential data transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) may be granted for enabling statistical analyses for scientific purposes, and the rules of cooperation between the Commission (Eurostat) and national statistical authorities in order to facilitate such access.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018confidential data for scientific purposes\u2019 means data which only allow for indirect identification of the statistical units, taking the form of either secure-use files or scientific-use files;\n(2) \u2018secure-use files\u2019 means confidential data for scientific purposes to which no further methods of statistical disclosure control have been applied;\n(3) \u2018scientific-use files\u2019 means confidential data for scientific purposes to which methods of statistical disclosure control have been applied to reduce to an appropriate level and in accordance with current best practice the risk of identification of the statistical unit;\n(4) \u2018statistical disclosure control methods\u2019 means methods to reduce the risk of disclosing information on the statistical units, usually based on restricting the amount of, or modifying, the data released;\n(5) \u2018access facilities\u2019 means the physical or virtual environment and its organisational setting where access to confidential data for scientific purposes is provided;\n(6) \u2018national statistical authorities\u2019 means the national statistical institutes and other national authorities responsible in each Member State for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics as designated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.", "General principles\nThe Commission (Eurostat) may grant access to confidential data for scientific purposes held by it for the development, production or dissemination of European statistics as referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) access is requested by a recognised research entity;\n(b) an appropriate research proposal has been submitted;\n(c) the requested type of confidential data for scientific purposes has been indicated;\n(d) access is provided either by the Commission (Eurostat) or by another access facility accredited by the Commission (Eurostat);\n(e) the relevant national statistical authority which provided the data has given its approval.", "Research entities\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognition of research entities shall be based on criteria referring to:\n(a) the purpose of the entity;
