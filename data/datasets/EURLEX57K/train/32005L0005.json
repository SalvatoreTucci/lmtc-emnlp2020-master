Commission Directive 2002/26/EC of 13 March 2002 laying down the sampling methods and methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of ochratoxin A in foodstuffs\u00a0(3), should include provisions related to roasted coffee beans, ground roasted coffee, soluble coffee, wine and grape juice.\n(3) Directive 2002/26/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/26/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive 12 months after the entry into force at the latest.
