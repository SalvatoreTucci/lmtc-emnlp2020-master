The following text is added to Article 1:\n'- the apparatus \"Ultra-FOM\" and the assessment method related thereto, details of which are given in Part 5 of Annex I.\nAs regards the apparatus \"Ultra-FOM\", it is laid down that after the end of the measurement procedure it must be possible to verify on the carcase that the apparatus measured the values of measurement X1, X2 and X3 on the site provided for in Annex I Part 5 point 3. The corresponding marking of the measurement site must be made at the same time as the measurement procedure.`\n2.

Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Ultra-FOM\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an ultrasonic probe at 4 MHz (Krautkr\u0102\u00a4mer MB 4 SE). The ultrasonic signal is digitized, stored and processed by a micro-processor (type intel 80 C 31).\nThe results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the Ultra-FOM apparatus itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 70,35 - 0,687 X1 - 0,686 X2 + 0,034 X3\nwhere:\n^y = estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase, at the last rib,\nX2 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,\nX3 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms.`"}
