The unutilised quantity amounts to 5\u00a0755 tonnes.\n(4) Spain, on the other hand, had requested, pursuant to Article 4(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas\u00a0(3) that, within the limits indicated in that Regulation, part of their mackerel fishing quota for 2011 be withheld and transferred to the following year.\n(5) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 319/2012 of 13 April 2012 adding to the 2012 fishing quotas certain quantities withheld in the year 2011 pursuant to Article 4(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96\u00a0(4) transferred 2\u00a0511 tonnes of Spain\u2019s 2011 unutilised mackerel fishing quota to the year 2012. Hence, the remaining 2011 unutilised tonnage amounts to 3\u00a0244.\n(6) The amount of 3\u00a0244 tonnes should be used to reschedule the deductions foreseen in Regulation (EU) No 165/2011. This quantity should be added to the 2011 deduction amount, which totalizes 7\u00a0744, and simultaneously subtracted from the deduction amount of subsequent years.\n(7) Spain requested that the unutilised tonnage be subtracted from the 2013 and 2014 deduction amounts. This is compatible with the rationale expressed in recital 7 of Regulation (EU) No 165/2011. Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 should, therefore, be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 October 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 48, 23.2.2011, p. 11.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 104, 14.4.2012, p. 2.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nStock Initial quota 2010\u00a0(1) Adapted quota 2010 Established catches 2010 Difference quota-catches Multiplying factor of Article 105(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 Deduction 2011 Deduction 2012 Deduction 2013 Deduction 2014 Deduction 2015 and, where appropriate, for subsequent years\nMAC/8C3411 27\u00a0919 24\u00a0604 44\u00a0225 \u201319\u00a0621 \u201339\u00a0242 7\u00a0744 5\u00a0500 8\u00a0126 8\u00a0125 9\u00a0747\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 53/2010\u2019."}
