Implementing rules should be laid down for the quota year 2005/06 starting on 1 July 2005.\n(2) The 2004/05 quota was managed in conformity with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1203/2004 of 29 June 2004 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 (1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005)\u00a0(2). That Regulation introduced a method of administration based on an import performance criterion ensuring that the quota is allocated to professional operators able to import beef without undue speculation.\n(3) The experience obtained from the application of that method shows that there are positive results and therefore it is appropriate to maintain the same method of administration for the quota year 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.\n(4) It is appropriate to determine a reference period for eligible imports which is long enough to provide for a representative performance while also sufficiently recent to reflect the latest development in trade.\n(5) For control reasons, applications for import rights should be submitted in the Member States where the operator is entered in the national VAT register.\n(6) In order to prevent speculation, a security relating to import rights should be fixed for each applicant under the quota.\n(7) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be established that such obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(3).\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(5) should be applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation, save where derogations are appropriate.\n(9) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not given an opinion within the time limit set by its President,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tariff quota totalling 53\u00a0000 tonnes expressed in weight of boneless meat is hereby opened for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.\nThe order number of the tariff quota shall be 09.4003.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Common Customs Tariff duty applicable to the quota provided for in paragraph 1 shall be 20\u00a0% ad valorem.", "For the purposes of this Regulation,\n(a) 100\u00a0kilograms of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 77\u00a0kilograms of boneless meat;\n(b) \u2018frozen meat\u2019 means meat that is frozen and has an internal temperature of \u2013 12\u00a0\u00b0C or lower when it enters the customs territory of the Community.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Community operator may apply for import rights on the basis of a reference quantity which shall be the quantities of beef falling under CN codes 0201, 0202, 0206\u00a010\u00a095 or 0206\u00a029\u00a091 imported by him/her or on his behalf under the relevant customs provisions, between 1 May 2004 and 30 April 2005.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A company formed by the merger of companies each having reference imports may use those reference imports as basis for its application.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of imports referred to in paragraph 1 shall accompany the application for import rights and shall be provided by means of a duly endorsed copy for the consignee of the customs declaration for release for free circulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No later than 13.00, Brussels time, on the second Friday following the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, applications for import rights shall reach the competent authority in the Member State where the applicant is entered in the national VAT register.\nAll quantities presented as reference quantity, in application of Article 3, shall constitute the import rights applied for.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After verifying the documents submitted, the Member States shall communicate to the Commission no later than the fifth Friday following the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, a list of applicants for import rights under the quota provided for in Article 1(1), including in particular their names and addresses and the quantities of eligible meat imported during the reference period concerned.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Communications of the information referred to in paragraph 2, including nil returns, shall be sent by fax or e-mail using the form in Annex I.", "The Commission shall decide as soon as possible the extent to which import rights under the quota provided for in Article 1(1) may be granted.
