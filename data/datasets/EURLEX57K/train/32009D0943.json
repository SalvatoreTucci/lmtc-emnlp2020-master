Such a procedure should ensure that decisions expressing the Community\u2019s agreement can be taken swiftly.\n(5) When informed by Denmark of its intention to enter into an international agreement, the Commission should assess the coherence of that agreement with Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007, including Community legislation affecting that Regulation, and set out any arrangements which may be necessary. As the objective is to arrive at a uniform application of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 in all Member States and in Denmark, the Commission should ensure that Denmark does not enter into a specific international agreement if this could affect the conditions on which the Community would itself accede to the agreement in question, or, as the case may be, would authorise the Member States to accede to it in the interest of the Community. If the Community is already party to the agreement in question or if the Community has authorised the Member States to become party thereto in the interest of the Community, the Commission should make an assessment of a more limited nature with the aim of verifying that Denmark proposes to accede to the international agreement on the same conditions as the Community or, as the case may be, the Member States as authorised by the Community.\n(6) Decision 2006/326/EC should be amended accordingly in order to provide for such a procedure.\n(7) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(8) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application,", "main_body": ["The following Articles shall be inserted in Decision 2006/326/EC:\n\u2018Article 1a\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of applying Article 5(2) of the Agreement, the Commission shall assess, before taking a decision expressing the Community\u2019s agreement, whether the international agreement envisaged by Denmark would not render the Agreement ineffective and would not undermine the proper functioning of the system established by its rules.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall take a reasoned decision within 90 days of being informed by Denmark of Denmark\u2019s intention to enter into the international agreement in question.\nIf the international agreement in question meets the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, the decision by the Commission shall express the Community\u2019s agreement within the meaning of Article 5(2) of the Agreement.", "b\nThe Commission shall inform the Member States of the international agreements which Denmark has been authorised to conclude in accordance with Article 1a.\u2019"], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
