From the assessment of that information, it appears that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia complies with the relevant requirements laid down in that Regulation and should therefore be included in the list set out in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the following entry is inserted between the entry for Saint Lucia and that for Montserrat:\n\u2018MK \u2026 the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0146, 13.6.2003, p.\u00a01."}
