It is appropriate to establish the Community producer price for one of those products and calculate the Community producer price for the others by means of the conversion factors established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 802/2006 of 30 May 2006 fixing the conversion factors applicable to fish of the genera Thunnus and Euthynnus\n\u00a0(2).\n(5) On the basis of the criteria laid down in the first and second indents of Article 18(2) and in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the Community producer price for the 2009 fishing year should be adjusted.\n(6) Given the urgency of the matter, it is important to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in paragraph 1(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union,", "main_body": ["For the fishing year from 1 January to 31 December 2009, the guide prices as provided for in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be as set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "For the fishing year from 1 January to 31 December 2009, the Community producer prices as provided for in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be as set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
