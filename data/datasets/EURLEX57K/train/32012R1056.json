If necessary, any appropriate transitional measures for the purposes of the establishment of this list may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EU) No 234/2011, the applicants shall take into account latest guidance concerning the data required for risk assessment established by the European Food Safety Authority (\"the Authority\") that is available at the time of the submission of the application. The Authority adopted a scientific opinion on 23 July 2009 providing guidance on data requirements for the evaluation of food enzyme applications\u00a0(4) and issued on 8 July 2011 an explanatory note for the guidance on the submission of a dossier on food enzymes\u00a0(5). It also adopted a scientific opinion on 25 May 2011 updating the guidance for the risk assessment of genetically modified micro-organisms and their products intended for food and feed use\u00a0(6).\n(5) The detailed requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 234/2011, by the Authority\u2019s guidance documents and explanatory note were adopted later than Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008.\n(6) The experience gained in the meantime shows that the initial deadline for submitting applications is insufficient in order to allow stakeholders and in particular small and medium sized enterprises to produce all necessary data within that period. More time than originally foreseen is required for the submission of the applications to enhance the smooth transition from the present legal situation to the system established by Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008. Therefore, the 24-month period established by Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 for submitting enzyme applications should be extended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["In Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\"The deadline for submitting such applications shall be 42 months after the date of application of the implementing measures laid down in accordance with Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 7.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 64, 11.3.2011, p. 15.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1305, p. 1. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdoc/doc/1305.pdf\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Supporting Publication 2011:177. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/doc/177e.pdf\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011;9(6):2193. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2193.pdf"}
