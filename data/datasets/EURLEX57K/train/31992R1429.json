The following is added to point 4.1.2.:\n'and the resolution index, lr, using the formula\na\nb\nwhere:\na = the height of the smallest peak, measured from the base line;\nb = the height of the lowest point of the valley between the two adjacent peaks, measured from the base line.'\n2. The following point 6 is added:\n'6. SPECIAL CASE - DETERMINATION OF TRANS-ISOMERS\nIt is possible to determine the content of trans-isomers in fatty acids with a number of carbon atoms between 10 and 24 by separating the methyl esters using gas chromatography capillary columns having a specific polarity.\n6.1. A capillary column made of silica having an internal diameter of between 0,25 mm and 0,32 mm and a length of 50 m, coated with cyanopropisilicon, the thickness of the coating being between 0,1 and 0,3 \u00ecm (type SP 2380, C.P. sil 88,  silor 10 and similar types).\n6.2. The methyl esters are prepared using the procedure set out in Annex X B. As a precaution, fatty substances having a free acidity over 3 % must be neutralized in accordance with 6.1 of Annex VII.\n6.3. The operating conditions for gas chromatography are overall as follows:\n- column temperature set between 150 \u00b0C and 230 \u00b0C (for example 165 \u00b0C for 15 minutes then increasing by 5 \u00b0C a minute to 200 \u00b0C);\n- injector temperature: 250 \u00b0C if the splitting system is used or the initial temperature of the column if the on-column system is used;\n- detector temperature: 260 \u00b0C;\n- flow rate of the carrier gas (helium and hydrogen): 1,2 ml a minute.\nThe quantity injected must be such that in the conditions of sensitivity employed the height of the peak corresponding to the methyl ester of the arachidic acid is equal to or greater than 20 % of the bottom of the scale.\n6.4. Identification of the various methyl esters is effected on the basis of the retention times which are compared with those for the reference mixtures (as indicated at point 2.3).\nThe esters of trans fatty acids are eluted before the corresponding cis-isomers. An example of a chromatogram is given in figure 2.\nFigure 2:\nGas chromatogram of the trans-isomers of fatty acid using capillary column.\n6.5. The efficiency of the column determined in accordance with point 4.1.2 must be such as to allow separation of certain critical couples, for example the couple formed by the massif of the transisoleic acids and the oleic acid peak, trans C18:1/cis  C18:1, with a resolution index greater than 2.\n6.6. The percentage of the various trans fatty acids is calculated on the basis of the relationship between the surface of the relevant peak and the sum of the surfaces of all the peaks present.\nThe percentages of:\n- the trans octadecenoic acids (T 18: 1) indicated in Annex I to this Regulation as the sum of the transoleic isomers;\n- the cis-trans and trans-cis octadecadienoic acids [(CT/TC) 18: 2] indicated in Annex I to this Regulation as the sum of the translinoleic isomers;\n- the trans-cis-trans, cis-cis-trans, cis-trans-cis, trans-cis-cis, octadecatrienoic acids [(TCT + CCT + CTC + TCC) 18: 3], indicated in Annex I of this Regulation as the sum of the translinolenic isomers\nare taken into account.\nNote 8: Taking into account the particular characteristics of this method, please give the results with 2 decimals.'\n3. The existing points 6 and 7 become points 7 and 8 respectively."}
