Auxiliary staff may also perform specific short-term tasks in accordance with the high standards laid down in the Staff Regulations. Auxiliary staff complement permanent officials in highly specialised areas where the expertise needed is not otherwise available.\n(2) The possibility of extending the duration of an auxiliary contract constitutes a useful element of flexibility in the use of the institutions' human resources.\n(3) The possibility of extending the duration of an auxiliary contract beyond one year is justified in order to allow the institutions to respond, when the interests of the service so require, to the need to ensure a certain continuity of service and/or benefit fully from the qualifications and training of the staff member concerned.\n(4) Article 52 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities should therefore be amended in order to extend the maximum duration of contracts for auxiliary staff to three years,", "main_body": ["Article 52(b) of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities shall be replaced by the following: \"(b) three years, in all other cases.\".", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 March 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
