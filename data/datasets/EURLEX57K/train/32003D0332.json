The objective of the project is to investigate some aspects of microbiological accumulation in bivalve shellfish in relation to human health, specially in the area of contamination of shellfish by Norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), the detection of NVs in shellfish and the detection of both total vibrios and pathogenic strains in bivalve shellfish.\n(4) In the light of the zoonotic importance of bacterial and viral contamination of bivalve molluscs, it is appropriate to provide financial assistance for a period of not more than one year to cover certain costs incurred by CEFAS in order to carry out the project. Therefore, the Community financial assistance should be increased to cover CEFAS's amended annual work programme.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003(6), provides for a procedure to establish the status of a country with respect to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The Regulation also sets out a BSE monitoring programme for the Community.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 furthermore designates the Veterinary Laboratories Agency at Weybridge, United Kingdom as the Community reference laboratory (CRL) for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Its functions includes collecting and collating data on the results of tests carried out in the Community and keeping abreast of trends in surveillance, epidemiology and prevention of TSEs throughout the world.\n(7) The Commission has invited the CRL for TSEs to add to its annual work programme the analysis of the results of the Community BSE monitoring programme and the development, on the basis of such analysis, of an epidemiological valid integrated approach to initial and continuing evaluation of country BSE status. In carrying out this task, the CRL for TSEs takes into account the method developed by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) for assessment of the geographical BSE risk and the recommendations of the International Animal Health Organisation (OIE) on BSE risk categories and surveillance and monitoring systems. To this end, the CRL for TSEs has added a project, presented on 20 February 2003, to its annual work programme. Therefore, the Community financial assistance should be increased to cover the amended annual work programme of the CRL for TSEs.\n(8) Rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 324/2003 of 20 February 2003 establishing the eligibility criteria for the expenditure of the Community reference laboratories receiving financial assistance under Article 28 of Decision 90/424/EEC and establishing the procedures for the submission of expenditure and the conduct of audits(7), should apply without prejudice to the need for providing different deadlines appropriate to the schedule for the projects concerned.\n(9) Decision 2003/126/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/126/EC, is amended as follows:\n1.
