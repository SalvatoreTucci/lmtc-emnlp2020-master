Those themes and products are listed in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1071/2005\u00a0(2).\n(2) Under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000, guidelines are to be laid down for each sector or product selected, giving a broad outline of the campaigns to be carried out in those sectors. The guidelines for the sectors and products selected are given in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2005.\n(3) The recent avian influenza crisis has destabilised the poultrymeat sector, leading to a significant fall in consumption and a crisis in consumer confidence. As a result, provision should be made for the possibility of carrying out information and/or promotion measures in that sector to restore lasting consumer confidence, in particular by providing appropriate information.\n(4) Poultrymeat should therefore be included in the list of products to be promoted, and guidelines giving a broad outline of the campaigns to be carried out in that sector should be laid down.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1071/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Joint Management Committee for the Promotion of Agricultural Products,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1071/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. the following indent is added to Annex I:\n\u2018\u2014 Poultrymeat\u2019;\n2. the text of the Annex to this Regulation is added to Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 July 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 23.12.2000, p. 2.
