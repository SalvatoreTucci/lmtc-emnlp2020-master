Finland has therefore requested that the water catchment area of Vesij\u00e4rvi be excluded from the eradication programme. Annex II should be amended accordingly.\n(5) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU currently lists nine compartments in the territory of Ireland with an approved surveillance programme as regards ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar).\n(6) Ireland has notified to the Commission the detection of OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar in Drumcliff within compartment 3, Shannon Estuary within compartment 6 and Oysterhaven Bay within compartment 9. Consequently, the geographical demarcation of those compartments in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU should be amended.\n(7) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU lists the territories of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Guernsey with an approved surveillance programme as regards OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar.\n(8) The United Kingdom has notified the Commission the detection of OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar in England and Northern Ireland. Consequently, the geographical demarcation of those territories in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU should be amended.\n(9) Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Decision 2010/221/EU are replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 24.11.2006, p. 14.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 98, 20.4.2010, p. 7.\nANNEX\nANNEX II\nMember States and parts thereof with eradication programmes as regards certain diseases in aquaculture animals, and approved to take national measures to control those diseases in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the area with approved national measures\nBacterial kidney disease (BKD) Finland FI The following water catchment areas:\nSweden SE The continental parts of the territory\nInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPN) Sweden SE The coastal parts of the territory\nANNEX III\nMember States and areas with surveillance programmes regarding ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar), and approved to take national measures to control that disease in accordance with Article 43(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC\nDisease Member State Code Geographical demarcation of the areas with approved national measures\nOstreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar) Ireland IE Compartment 1: Sheephaven Bay\nUnited Kingdom UK The territory of Great Britain except Whitstable Bay, Kent"}
