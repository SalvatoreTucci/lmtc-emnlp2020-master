In order to ensure the effective implementation of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, it is appropriate to provide for further information to be indicated in the equipment records.\n(2) Information on the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge should be included in the equipment records. Where the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge is unknown, the operator of the equipment concerned should ensure that certified personnel determine that charge in order to facilitate the leakage checking.\n(3) Before the leakage check is carried out, certified personnel should carefully go through the information contained in the equipment records to determine any previous issues and consult previous reports.\n(4) In order to ensure an efficient leakage control, the leakage checks should focus on those parts of the equipment which are most likely to leak.\n(5) Leakage checks should be carried out using direct or indirect measuring methods. Direct measuring methods identify leakage by the use of detection devices which can determine whether the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge is escaping from the system. Indirect measuring methods are based on the identification of abnormal performance in the system and on the analysis of relevant parameters.\n(6) Indirect measuring methods should be applied in cases where the leakage develops very slowly and where the equipment is placed in a well ventilated environment making it difficult to detect fluorinated greenhouse gases escaping from the system in the air. Direct measuring methods are necessary to identify the exact location of the leakage. The decision on the measuring method to be used should be taken by certified personnel who have the necessary training and experience to determine the most appropriate measuring method on a case by case basis.\n(7) Where there is a presumption of a leakage it should be followed up by a check to identify and to repair it.\n(8) In order to ensure the safety of the system repaired, the follow-up check provided for in Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 should focus on the parts of the system where leakage has been detected and on the adjacent parts.\n(9) Defective installation of new systems constitutes a significant risk of leakage. Therefore, newly installed systems should be checked for leakage immediately after they have been put into service.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, the standard leakage checking requirements for working and temporarily out of operation stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment containing 3 kg or more of fluorinated greenhouse gases.\nThis Regulation shall not apply to equipment with hermetically sealed systems, which are labelled as such and contain less than 6 kg of fluorinated greenhouse gases.", "Equipment records\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The operator shall indicate his name, postal address and telephone number in the records referred to in Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, hereinafter \u2018equipment records\u2019.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fluorinated greenhouse gas charge for the refrigeration, air conditioning or heat pump equipment shall be indicated in the equipment records.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge for refrigeration, air conditioning or heat pump equipment is not indicated in the manufacturer\u2019s technical specifications or on the label of that system, the operator shall ensure that it is determined by certified personnel.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the cause of the leakage has been identified, it shall be indicated in the equipment records.", "Checking equipment records\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before carrying out leakage checks, certified personnel shall check the equipment records.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Special attention shall be paid to relevant information on any repeating issues and problem areas.", "Systematic checks\nThe following parts of the refrigeration, air conditioning or heat pump equipment shall be systematically checked:\n1. joints;\n2. valves including stems;\n3. seals, including seals on replaceable driers and filters;\n4. parts of the system subject to vibration;\n5. connections to safety or operational devices.", "Choice of measuring method\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certified personnel shall apply a direct measuring method as specified in Article 6 or an indirect measuring method as specified in Article 7 when carrying out a leakage check in relation to refrigeration, air conditioning or heat pump equipment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Direct measuring methods may always be applied.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indirect measuring methods shall only be applied where the parameters of the equipment to be analysed, referred to in Article 7(1), give reliable information on the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge indicated in the records of the equipment and the likelihood of leakage.", "Direct measuring methods\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To identify leakage, certified personnel shall use one or more of the following direct measuring methods:\n(a) check of circuits and components representing a risk of leakage with gas detection devices adapted to the refrigerant in the system;\n(b) application of ultraviolet (UV) detection fluid or suitable dye in the circuit;\n(c) proprietary bubble solutions/soapsuds.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gas detection devices referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall be checked every 12 months to ensure their proper functioning.
