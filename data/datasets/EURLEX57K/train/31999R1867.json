This has, inter alia, increased local production costs and reduced the competitiveness of local potatoes. It has also delayed the harvest, which means that marketing of local production has shifted into a period where competition with external deliveries is at its height;\n(5) In addition to the above difficulties, available data indicate a large increase in quantities of ware potatoes delivered to the Canary Islands in the past few weeks and this is exacerbating the market situation there. The latest available information indicates that deliveries of potatoes, in particular those from the rest of the Community, which represent the entire market at this time of the year, are being made at prices lower than those in previous years and this has caused a reduction in prices on the Canary Islands' market, with selling prices for local products aligning with those of products delivered from the rest of the Community. Given the availability of the latter, there is a real risk that this situation will continue;\n(6) As a result of the deliveries from the rest of the Community and from third countries the Canary Islands' market is threatened with serious disturbances likely to jeopardise the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty since the current level of selling prices is insufficient for local farmers to cover their production costs and derive a fair income from that activity. If that situation continues measures to restrict quantities should be introduced. Given the currently available information, then, measures should be adopted at this stage allowing the Commission to monitor closely the development of deliveries of ware potatoes to the Canary Islands' market during August, September and October 1999. The introduction of a system for issuing delivery certificates for ware potatoes and the weekly transmission of data to the Commission by the Spanish authorities are appropriate measures for that purpose,", "main_body": ["1.
