Such expenditure, or a part thereof, may still be financed by the EAGGF under the 1983 accounts clearance procedure, provided that Greece provides the necessary evidence at latest six weeks after notification of this Decision;\nWhereas under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1078/77 of 17 May 1977 introducing a system of premiums for the non-marketing of milk and milk products and for the conversion of dairy herds (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1300/84 (5), 60 % of expenditure on those measures is borne by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF and 40 % by the Guidance Section; whereas the said measures count as intervention within the meaning of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and constitute a common measure within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of that Regulation; whereas it is therefore necessary to include Guidance Section expenditure when clearing the accounts in respect of expenditure financed by the EAGGF;\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be drawn in any subsequent clearance of accounts for national aids in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty or infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty currently in progress or concluded after the date of 1 October 1985 or as a result of infringements in 1982 or national aids incompatible with the Treaty paid in 1982 having affected the expenditure charged to the EAGGF in any financial year subsequent to that of 1982;\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be determined by the Commission in the course of a subsequent clearance of accounts relating to current investigations, financial losses resulting from irregularities in the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 or judgments by the Court of Justice on cases currently under consideration and concerning matters which are also the subject of this Decision,", "main_body": ["The expenditure by the Hellenic Republic recognized as chargeable to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, in respect of the 1982 financial year amounts, in accordance with the Annex, to Dr 36 430 369 938.", "The financial resources available at the end of 1982 amount, in accordance with the Annex to Dr 8 808 777 955.", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 June 1986.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 94, 28. 4. 1970, p. 13.\n(2) OJ No L 362, 31. 12. 1985, p. 17.\n(3) OJ No L 186, 16. 8. 1972, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 131, 26. 5. 1977, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 125, 12. 5. 1984, p. 3.\nANNEX\nClearance of the accounts concerning the expenditure financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, for 1982\n1.2.3 //  //  // (Drachmas)   // 1.
