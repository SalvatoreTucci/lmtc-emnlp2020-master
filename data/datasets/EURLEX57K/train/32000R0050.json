Separate measures imposing similar obligatory labelling for additives and flavourings should be introduced;\n(10) in particular, in accordance with the approach adopted in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 258197, it is necessary to ensure that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders this food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. To this end additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms that are not equivalent to their traditional counterparts must be subject to labelling requirements;\n(11) in accordance with the approach adopted in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, labelling requirements must be based on scientific assessment;\n(12) clear labelling rules should be formulated for the abovementioned products so as to ensure that official inspections can be carried out on the basis of reliable, reproducible and practicable data;\n(13) care should also be taken to ensure that the labelling requirements are not excessively complex but nevertheless sufficiently detailed to provide consumers with the information they need;\n(14) Regulation (EC) No 1139!98 specifies the criterion according to which the labelling obligations become operative for food produced from genetically modified maize or soya;\n(15) the presence in additives and, flavourings used as ingredients in a foodstuff of protein or DNA resulting from genetic modification is, as matters stand, also the criterion that best meets the abovementioned requirements. Such an approach could be re-examined in the light of new scientific evidence;\n(16) in view of the scope and consequences of the proposed action, the Community measures introduced by this Regulation are not only necessary but indeed essential to achieve the objectives;\n(17) adventitious contamination of additives and flavourings with DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification cannot be excluded; it is useful to examine the possibility of setting up a threshold in order to avoid labelling as a result of such contamination;\n(18) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["1. This Regulation provides for specific additional labelling requirements for food and food ingredients intended for final consumers and mass caterers hereinafter referred to as \"specified foodstuffs\") containing additives and/or flavourings as described in paragraph 2 (hereinafter referred to as \"specified additives and flavourings\").\n2. The following are specified additives and flavourings:\n- additives falling within the scope of Directive 89/107/EEC and/or\n- flavourings for use in foodstuffs falling within the scope of Directive 88/388/EEC\nwhich are, contain or are produced from genetically modified organisms within the meaning of Council Directive 90/220/EEC(10).", "Without prejudice to the other requirements of Community legislation on food labelling, the labelling of the specified foodstuffs must inform final consumers and mass caterers of:\n(a) in accordance with Article 4(1), any characteristic or food property such as:\n- composition\n- nutritional value or nutritional effects\n- intended use of the additives, or flavourings\nas a result of which the specified additives or flavourings are no longer equivalent to existing additives or flavourings;\n(b) the presence in the specified additives or flavourings of material which is not present in existing equivalent additives or flavourings and which may affect the health of certain sections of the population;\n(c) the presence in the specified additives or flavourings of material which is not present in existing equivalent additives or flavourings and which gives rise to ethical concerns;\n(d) in accordance with Article 4(2), the presence of an additive or flavouring that is or contains an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, the non-exhaustive list of which is laid down in Annex I A, Part 1, of Directive 90/220/EEC.", "The specified additives or flavourings shall be deemed to be no longer equivalent within the meaning of Article 2(a) if scientific assessment, based upon an appropriate analysis of existing data, can demonstrate that the characteristics assessed are different in comparison with traditional additives or flavourings, having regard to the accepted limits of natural variations of such characteristics. This is the case where the specified additives or flavourings contain protein and/or DNA resulting from genetic modification.", "1.
