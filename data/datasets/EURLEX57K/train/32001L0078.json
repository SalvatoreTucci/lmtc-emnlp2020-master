These models differ from the model notices in the annexes to the Directives.\n(3) The models laid down in the Directives now need to be modified in order to contribute to simplifying the implementation of the advertising rules while adapting them to the electronic means developed as part of the information system for public procurement (SIMAP), launched by the Commission in collaboration with the Member States. Moreover, the use of standard forms and the possible use of the common procurement vocabulary (CPV) will contribute to greater transparency in the market. For clarification purposes, it is suitable to replace the abovementioned annexes by the standard form.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinions of both the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement and the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Procurement,", "main_body": ["1.
