In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Article 22 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the Member States and the Commission shall communicate to each other the information necessary for implementing that Regulation. It is necessary, if the information required to operate the organised market is to be available on a standard basis and in due time, to define in detail the obligations of the Member States as regards the communication of information.\n(3) The application of the intervention measures provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 requires precise knowledge of the market. In order to achieve the highest degree of comparability, the prices for slaughtered pigs to be taken into account should be the quotations as determined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/2006 of 24 July 2006 on the marketing stage to which the average price for pig carcases refers\u00a0(4). In particular, for the purposes of regular review and in order that intervention measures may be prepared in sufficient time, such information must be available regarding piglet prices as will enable future changes in the market to be assessed.\n(4) It may occur that quotations are not received by the Commission. A situation must be avoided where the lack of a quotation causes an abnormal evolution in the market prices calculated by the Commission. The missing quotation or quotations should be replaced by the last quotation available. The use of the last quotation available is no longer possible after a certain period without quotations, which may lead to the presumption of an abnormal situation in the market concerned.\n(5) In order to obtain a view of the market which is as accurate as possible it is desirable that regular information on the other products of the pigmeat sector is available to the Commission, as well as other information which Member States have at their disposal.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall communicate to the Commission at the latest on the Thursday of each week concerning the preceding week:\n(a) the quotations as determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1128/2006;\n(b) the representative quotations for piglets per head of an average live weight of approximately 20 kilograms.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where one or more quotations are not received by the Commission the latter shall take into account the last quotation available.
