The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use has concluded that the extrapolation to other food producing species cannot be supported for this substance.\n(6) Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the substance double stranded ribonucleic acid homologous to viral ribonucleic acid coding for part of the coat protein and part of the intergenic region of the Israel Acute Paralysis Virus for bees while establishing the absence of the need to establish a MRL, applicable to honey.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the following substance is inserted in alphabetical order:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic Classification\n\u2018Double stranded ribonucleic acid homologous to viral ribonucleic acid coding for part of the coat protein and part of the intergenic region of the Israel Acute Paralysis Virus NOT APPLICABLE Bees No MRL required Honey NO ENTRY NO ENTRY\u2019"}
