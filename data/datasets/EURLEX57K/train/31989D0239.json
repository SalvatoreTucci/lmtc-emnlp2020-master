ANNEX I   PROGRAMME CONTENTS AND INDICATIVE INTERNAL ALLOCATION OF FUNDS\nThe aim of the programme is the joint development of a system of management of nuclear installations finally shut down and of the radioactive wastes produced in their dismantling which, at its various stages, will provide mankind and the environment  with the best protection possible. The programme will involve demonstration of relevant technologies. Indicative allocation of funds\nincluding staff and administrative\ncosts (million ecus)\nThe programme covers the following areas:\nA.\nResearch and development projects concerning the following subjects:\n8,4\nNo 1: Long-term integrity of buildings and systems\nNo 2: Decontamination for decommissioning purposes\nNo 3: Dismantling techniquesNo 4: Treatment of specific waste materials: steel, concrete and graphite\nNo 5: Qualification and adaptation of remote-controlled semi-\nautonomous manipulator systemsNo 6: Estimation of the quantities of radioactive wastes arising\nfrom the decommissioning of nuclear installations in the Community\nB.\nIdentification of guiding principles relating to:\n1,1\n- the design and operation of nuclear installations with a view to simplifying their subsequent decommissioning,\n- the decommissioning operations with a view to making occupational radiation exposures as low as reasonably achievable,\n- the technical elements of a Community policy in this field.\nC.\nTesting of new techniques in practice:\n- pilot projects\n- alternative tests\n- staff secondment\n16,6\n4,3\n1,1\naa\na\ns\n22,0\nTOTAL\n31,5\n(of which ECU 3 million relate to staff and administrative costs)\nANNEX II  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME AND RATE OF THE COMMUNITY'S FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION\nThe programme consists of activities carried out by means of shared-cost research contracts with competent public organizations or private firms established in the Member States. The participation of SMEs in the programme will be encouraged.\nThe Commission shall distribute, in all the official languages of the Community, information packs to accompany the invitation to participate in order to guarantee equal opportunities for the undertakings, universities and research centres in the Member  States.\nIn addition to shared-cost research contracts, the programme may also be carried out by means of study contracts, coordination projects and awards of training and mobility grants. Such contracts and grants shall, where appropriate, be awarded following  a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nParticipants in shared-cost contracts may be industrial organizations, research institutes and universities, established in the Community. Each contractor will be expected to make a significant contribution to projects. The contractor shall be expected  to bear a substantial proportion of the costs, 50 % of which shall normally be borne by the Community. Alternatively, in respect of universities and similar organizations carrying out projects, the Community may bear up to 100 % of the additional  expenditure involved.\nShared-cost research projects should, where appropriate, be carried out by participants from more than one Member State.\nWhere an opportunity for large scale cooperation involving different Member States exists, the programme may also be carried out through concerted action. This concerns in particular the selected pilot dismantling projects. In these cases, the Community  would participate through shared-cost contracts in specific parts of the projects and organize, by means of concerted action, an exchange of information relating to the other parts. The secondment\nof research staff from, wherever possible, all Member States to the pilot dismantling projects will be encouraged.\nThe information resulting from the implementation of the shared-cost activities shall be made accessible on an equal basis to all Member States. Licences and/or other rights developed in the framework of the programme will be subject to the normal  contractual conditions of the Community.\nANNEX III  EVALUATION CRITERIA\nThe programme is to be evaluated by independent experts in accordance with the Community plan of action relating to the evaluation of Community research and development activities. The following criteria are to be considered in the evaluation:\n- the extent to which research proposals were selected against relevant criteria,\n- the extent to which substantial development of knowledge, techniques and equipment has resulted from the work supported,\n- the potential relevance of the results with regard to industrial decommissioning operations,\n- the potential relevance of the results with regard to safety and protection aspects of decommissioning and in particular to occupational radiation exposure of decommissioning workers,\n- the potential relevance of the results with regard to the reliability of estimates for decommissioning costs,\n- the extent to which information exchange and cooperation across the borders of Member States have been promoted."}
