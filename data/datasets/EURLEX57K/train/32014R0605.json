With the accession of Croatia to the European Union on 1 July 2013, it is necessary that all hazard and precautionary statements provided for by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01272/2008 as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 487/2013 are available in the Croatian language as well. This Regulation introduces the necessary adjustments to the language tables.\n(2) Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 contains two lists of harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances. Table 3.1 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Parts 2 to 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Table 3.2 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Annex VI to Council Directive 67/548/EEC\u00a0(4).\n(3) Proposals for new or updated harmonised classification and labelling of certain substances have been submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Based on the opinions on those proposals issued by the Committee for Risk Assessment of ECHA, as well as on the comments received from the parties concerned, it is appropriate to introduce, remove or update harmonised classification and labelling of certain substances by amending Annex VI to that Regulation.\n(4) Compliance with the new harmonised classifications should not be required immediately, as a certain period of time will be necessary to allow suppliers to adapt the labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures to the new classifications and to sell existing stocks. In addition, a certain period of time will be necessary to allow suppliers to comply with the registration obligations resulting from the new harmonised classifications for substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, categories 1A and 1B (Table 3.1) and categories 1 and 2 (Table 3.2), or as very toxic to aquatic organisms which may cause long term effects in the aquatic environment, in particular with those set out in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5).\n(5) In line with the transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which allow the application of the new provisions at an earlier stage on a voluntary basis, suppliers should have the possibility of applying the new harmonised classifications and of adapting the labelling and packaging accordingly on a voluntary basis before the deadline for compliance.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Annex III is
