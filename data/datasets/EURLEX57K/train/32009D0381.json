Short-range devices are typically mass-market and/or portable products which can easily be taken and used across borders; differences in spectrum access conditions therefore prevent their free movement, increase their production costs and create risks of harmful interference with other radio applications and services.\n(2) Commission Decision 2008/432/EC\u00a0(3) amended the harmonised technical conditions for short-range devices contained in Decision 2006/771/EC by replacing its Annex.\n(3) However, due to rapid changes in technology and societal demands, new applications for short-range devices can emerge which require regular updates of spectrum harmonisation conditions.\n(4) On 5 July 2006, the Commission issued a permanent mandate\u00a0(4) to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), pursuant to Article 4(2) of Decision No 676/2002/EC, to update the Annex to Decision 2006/771/EC in response to the technological and market developments in the area of short-range devices.\n(5) In its November 2008 report\u00a0(5) submitted in response to that mandate, the CEPT advised the Commission to amend a number of technical aspects in the Annex to Decision 2006/771/EC.\n(6) Decision 2006/771/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Equipment operating within the conditions set in this Decision must also comply with Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\u00a0(6) in order to use the spectrum effectively so as to avoid harmful interference, demonstrated either by meeting harmonised standards or by fulfilling alternative conformity assessment procedures.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/771/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2009.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0312, 11.11.2006, p.\u00a066.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0151, 11.6.2008, p.\u00a049.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Permanent Mandate to CEPT regarding the annual update of the technical Annex to the Commission Decision on the technical harmonisation of radio spectrum for use by Short Range Devices (5 July 2006).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0CEPT Report 26, RSCOM 08-88.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a091, 7.4.1999, p.\u00a010.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nHarmonised frequency bands and technical parameters for short-range devices\nType of short-range device Frequency band Power limit/field strength limit/power density limit\u00a0(1) Additional parameters/spectrum access and mitigation requirements\u00a0(2) Other usage restrictions\u00a0(3) Implementation deadline\nNon-specific short-range devices\u00a0(4) 6\u00a0765\u20136\u00a0795 kHz 42 dB\u03bcA/m at 10 metres   1 October 2008\n13,553\u201313,567 MHz 42 dB\u03bcA/m at 10 metres   1 October 2008\n26,957\u201327,283 MHz 10 mW effective radiated power (e.r.p.), which corresponds to 42 dB\u03bcA/m at 10 metres  Video applications are excluded 1 June 2007\n40,660\u201340,700 MHz 10 mW e.r.p.
