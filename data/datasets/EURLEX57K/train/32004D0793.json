VAN DER HOEVEN\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 376.\nANNEX\nFOR THE ATTENTION OF THE PRIME MINISTER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT OF THE TOGOLESE REPUBLIC\nDear Sir,\nThe European Union attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement. The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law; these are essential elements of the Agreement and thus form the basis for relations between us.\nThe European Union believes that the political situation in Togo is deadlocked and that the democratic deficit and scant consideration for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute a violation of the essential elements set out in Article 9 of the abovementioned Agreement.\nIn view of this Article and the current political deadlock in Togo the European Union decided on 30 March 2004 to start consultations under Article 96 of the Agreement in order to thoroughly review the situation and find a remedy if possible.\nThese consultations started in Brussels on 14 April 2004. Several fundamental issues were addressed, and you were able to present the Togolese authorities\u2019 point of view and their analysis of the situation. The European Union was pleased to note that Togo made certain undertakings as stated in the Annex and proposed positive steps to improve the climate for democracy and the rule of law in the country.\nIt was agreed that an intensive dialogue on the various points raised would be held in Togo over a period of three months, and that the situation would be assessed at the end of this period.\nThis regular in-depth dialogue on a list of measures to be taken in order to implement the agreed undertakings has taken place.\nA number of significant measures have been taken by the Togolese authorities. In particular:\n\u2014 the authorities have organised information and awareness-raising meetings with prefects and police concerning various aspects of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They have distributed instructions and circulars setting out the existing directives and rules. This has produced some positive results, confirmed by the opposition,\n\u2014 the authorities have instructed the courts to bring to trial all persons remanded in custody in cases where preliminary investigations have been completed. This call for a speeding-up of procedures has led to the setting of 214 trial dates, including the cases of a number of prisoners considered political. The government ensured that lawyers had access to their clients during the preliminary inquiries. Nearly 500 prisoners were released in August, either through remittance of their sentences, or release on bail,\n\u2014 access to the media, hitherto a preserve of the government and the party in power outside election campaigns, has been extended in recent weeks to opposition parties, though access is not yet balanced,\n\u2014 the government has embarked on reform of the National Commission for Human Rights and the High Authority for Audiovisual and Communications,\n\u2014 a new press code was adopted by the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale on 24 August,\n\u2014 an analysis of the justice system has been carried out with the aid of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\n\u2014 the government is continuing efforts towards decentralisation and recently adopted a policy letter on the subject,\n\u2014 an initial meeting was held with the traditional opposition on 25 August, in order to establish a national dialogue in an organised and transparent framework.\nThese initiatives have undoubtedly improved respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in your country. Nevertheless, a number of points continue to give rise to concern, especially as regards the restoration of democracy:\nIn this connection the European Union is anxious for the following substantive measures to be taken, which are in keeping with the undertakings annexed hereto:\n\u2014 the implementation of the national dialogue in an organised and transparent framework in accordance with Undertaking 1.1,\n\u2014 in the context of this dialogue, a revision of the electoral arrangements ensuring a transparent and democratic process in accordance with Undertaking 1.3,\n\u2014 the establishment of a legal framework for the financing of political parties in accordance with Undertaking 1.4,\n\u2014 the organisation of parliamentary and local elections in accordance with Undertakings 1.5 and 1.6,\n\u2014 continuation of the process of decentralisation in accordance with Undertaking 1.7,\n\u2014 continued action on political prisoners followed by their possible liberation, as stipulated in Undertaking 2.2,\n\u2014 revision of the articles of association and terms of reference of the National Commission for Human Rights and the High Authority for Audiovisual and Communications in accordance with Undertakings 2.5 and 3.6,\n\u2014 continued reform of the legal and justice system in accordance with the recommendations of the UNDP diagnostic study.\nThe European Union also attaches great importance to the continuation and consolidation of the initiatives already undertaken in the context of Undertakings 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.\nIn follow-up to the consultations, and in light of the undertakings given thus far and the important measures still to be put in hand, it has been decided to adopt the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the Cotonou Agreement:\n1. continued implementation of projects financed with the unexpended balances of the sixth and seventh European Development Funds (EDF) that will meet the needs of the population and promote compliance with the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, namely, respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. The national programme of decentralised environmental management projects and the 1990-1994 Framework of Mutual Obligations for Stabex Funds will also be implemented;\n2. institutional aid for the implementation of measures to carry out the undertakings made during the consultations may be provided from the unexpended balances of the sixth and seventh EDF funds. In this connection the Commission will, amongst other things, adopt a financing decision on the programme to carry out a fourth general population and housing census;\n3. the ninth EDF allocation will be notified once electoral arrangements that will ensure transparent and democratic elections acceptable to all parties are established and a date for the holding of parliamentary elections is set. This will be the signal for the programming of resources;\n4. once the ninth EDF allocation is notified, aid for preparing the elections may be given as long as the conditions stipulated in the above electoral arrangements are adhered to;\n5. once free and fair parliamentary elections have been held, cooperation with the European Union will resume in full, with implementation of the ninth EDF and the 1995-1999 Framework of Mutual Obligations for Stabex Funds;\n6. contributions to regional projects will be considered on a case-by-case basis;\n7. humanitarian operations, trade cooperation and trade-linked preferences will not be affected.\nThe Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission will carry out regular joint reviews, at intervals of not more than six months.\nThe European Union will continue monitoring the situation in Togo closely; an enhanced political dialogue will be conducted with your Government over a 24-month monitoring period in order to ensure that it continues on the path mapped out towards democracy and the rule of law and pursues and consolidates its efforts in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nIf implementation of the Togolese authorities' undertakings speeds up, or on the contrary breaks down, the European Union reserves the right to adjust the appropriate measures.\nI have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully.\nDone at Brussels, 15 November 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council\nANNEX to the ANNEX\nLIST OF UNDERTAKINGS GIVEN BY THE TOGOLESE REPUBLIC\nThe Government of the Togolese Republic has given the following undertakings to the European Union during consultations held under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.\nUndertaking 1.1:\nAnnounce immediately, to ensure that democratic principles are fully upheld, the resumption of an open, credible national dialogue with the traditional opposition and civil society in an organised and transparent framework.\nUndertaking 1.2:\nGuarantee all political parties, without delay, freedom of action without fear of harassment, intimidation or censorship\nUndertaking 1.3:\nRevise the electoral arrangements on the basis of the Lom\u00e9 Framework Agreement so as to ensure transparent and democratic elections that are acceptable to all parties within six months.\nUndertaking 1.4:\nEnsure that all political parties have equitable access to public media and set up a fair system for the public funding of political parties.\nUndertaking 1.5:\nOrganise fresh parliamentary elections that are transparent, with international observers present at all stages of the process, as soon as possible, in keeping with the implementation of Undertaking 1.3 above.\nUndertaking 1.6:\nOrganise local elections that are transparent, with observers present at all stages of the process, within 12 months.\nUndertaking 1.7:\nCreate the conditions necessary for democratically elected municipal assemblies to have a mandate and the resources needed to establish effective and democratically legitimate local government within 12 months.\nUndertaking 2.1:\nEnsure that there are no instances of extrajudicial killings, torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment on Togolese soil; this includes the proper training of those managing the police and the justice system.\nUndertaking 2.2:\nFree all political prisoners who are clearly held for their political opposition, criticism of the government or other reasons not justifying detention.
