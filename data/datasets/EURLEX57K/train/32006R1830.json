That Regulation provides that import tariff quotas shall be opened for a period of 12 consecutive months and limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004, without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down in that Regulation.
