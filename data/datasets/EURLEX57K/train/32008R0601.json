Serious shortcomings were identified, in particular, regarding the capacity of the Gabonese authorities to take corrective action when high levels of heavy metals and sulphites occur.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(2) lays down maximum levels of heavy metals for certain fishery products.\n(4) European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC of 20 February 1995 on food additives others than colours and sweeteners\u00a0(3) lays down maximum levels of sulphites in certain fishery products.\n(5) Member States should therefore carry out appropriate checks on certain fishery products from Gabon on arrival at the Community border to ensure compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 and Directive 95/2/EC as regards heavy metals and sulphites, respectively.\n(6) Member States shall use appropriate sampling plans and analytical methods for these checks.
