whereas in the case of sawn wood, phytosanitary certificates are not generally issued in that country; whereas it appears that kiln-drying capacity is at present  limited in the USA;\nWhereas, in respect of the USA, the Commission has established, on the basis of the information supplied by the USA and collected in that country during a mission carried out in 1990, that an officially approved and monitored programme of issuing  certificates of debarking and grub-hole control has been set up to ensure proper debarking and to reduce the risk from harmful organisms; whereas the risk of spreading harmful organisms is reduced provided that the wood is accompanied by a Certificate  of Debarking and Grub-Hole Control issued under that programme;\nWhereas by Commission Decisions 91/107/EEC (3) and 91/636/EEC (4) the Commission authorized such derogations under technical conditions in respect of sawn wood of conifers originating in the USA, based on the use of the aforementioned Certificate of  Debarking and Grub-Hole Control;\nWhereas there have been no findings of grub-holes on sawn wood of conifers imported pursuant to Decision 91/107/EEC; whereas it has not been established, on the basis of available information, that there are elements which would militate against the  proper functioning of the aforementioned debarking and grub-hole control programme;\nWhereas Decision 91/636/EEC, stipulated that the authorization should expire on 31 December 1991;\nWhereas at present, proper kiln-drying is an effective measure to protect the Community against the introduction of certain organisms affecting wood of conifers; whereas, however, various kiln-drying schedules are commonly applied to different timber  species in order to dry them to a suitable level for end-use application; whereas these drying processes require the application of heat at various intensities and durations;\nWhereas a Community research programme has been set up to define parameters in the case of heat-treatment which ensure the eradication of the Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and its vectors, in order to enable the Commission to lay down the permanent  requirements to safeguard against the spread of the said organisms;\nWhereas the results of that research are not yet fully available;\nWhereas the authorization should therefore be extended for a further limited period of one year;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 91/107/EEC is hereby amended as follows:", "is replaced by:\n'The authorization granted in Article 1 shall expire on 31 December 1992, being the last date of entry into the Community.
