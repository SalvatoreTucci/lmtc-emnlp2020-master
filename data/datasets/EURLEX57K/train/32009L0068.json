In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) Directive 79/532/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74/150/EEC of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors, as replaced by Directive\u00a02003/37/EC\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0of 26\u00a0May\u00a02003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units\u00a0(5),\u00a0and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of agricultural or forestry tractors as regards the lighting and light-signalling devices. Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to enable the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive\u00a02003/37/EC to be applied in respect of each type of tractor. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, apply to this Directive.\n(3) In Directive 2009/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors\u00a0(6) common requirements were laid down for the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. Such lighting and light-signalling devices possess the same characteristics as those fitted to motor vehicles. Therefore, devices having received an EC component type-approval mark in accordance with the Directives already adopted on this subject in connection with the EC type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers may also be used on tractors.\n(4) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex II,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Directive, \u2018tractor\u2019 (agricultural or forestry) means any motor vehicle, fitted with wheels or endless tracks and having at least two axles, the main function of which lies in its tractive power and which is specially designed to tow, push, carry or power certain tools, machinery or trailers intended for agricultural or forestry use.
