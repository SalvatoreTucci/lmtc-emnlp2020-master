In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) Directive 93/74/EEC provides for the establishment of a positive list of the intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes. That list must indicate the precise use, that is to say, the particular nutritional purpose, the essential nutritional characteristics, the labelling declarations and where appropriate the special labelling requirements.\n(3) Certain nutritional purposes cannot be included at present in the list of intended uses due to the absence of Community methods of control for the energy value in pet foods and for dietary fibre in feedingstuffs. This list must be completed as soon as these methods have been adopted.\n(4) The established list may be modified, where appropriate, following developments in scientific and technical knowledge.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(6) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,", "main_body": ["Member States shall require that feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes within the meaning of Directive 93/74/EEC shall be marketed only if their intended uses are included in Part B of Annex I to this Directive and if they fulfil the other provisions laid down in that Part of Annex I.\nFurthermore, the Member States shall ensure that the provisions under \u2018General provisions\u2019 of Part A of Annex I are complied with.", "Directive 94/39/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 31 July 2008.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 237, 22.9.1993, p. 23.

Where there is more than one group of nutritional characteristics indicated in column 2 of Part B, denoted by \u2018and/or\u2019, for the same nutritional purpose, the manufacturer has the option to use either or both groups of essential characteristics, in order to achieve the nutritional purpose defined in column 1. For each option the corresponding labelling declarations are given opposite in column 4.\n2. Where a group of additives is mentioned in column 2 or column 4 of Part B the additive(s) used must be authorised in Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(1) as corresponding to the specified essential characteristic.\n3. Where the source(s) of ingredients or of analytical constituents is (are) required in column 4 of Part B, the manufacturer must make a precise declaration (e.g. specific name of the ingredient(s), animal species or part of the animal) allowing the evaluation of conformity of the feedingstuff with the corresponding essential nutritional characteristics.\n4. Where the declaration of a substance, also authorised as an additive, is required in column 4 of Part B and is accompanied by the expression \u2018total\u2019 the declared content must refer to, as appropriate, the quantity naturally present where none is added or, by derogation from Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2), the total quantity of the substance naturally present and the amount added as an additive.\n5. The declarations required in column 4 of Part B with the reference \u2018if added\u2019 are compulsory where the ingredient or the additive has been incorporated or increased specifically to enable the achievement of the particular nutritional purpose.\n6. The declarations to be given in accordance with column 4 of Part B concerning analytical constituents and additives must be quantitative.\n7. The recommended period of use indicated in column 5 of part B indicates a range within which the nutritional purpose should normally be achieved. Manufacturers can refer to more precise periods of use, within the fixed limits.\n8. Where a feedingstuff is intended to meet more than one particular nutritional purpose, it must comply with the corresponding entries in Part B.\n9. In the case of complementary feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes guidance on the balance of the daily ration must be provided in the instructions for use contained on the label.\nPART B\nList of intended uses\nParticular nutritional purpose Essential nutritional characteristics Species or category of animals Labelling declarations Recommended length of time Other
