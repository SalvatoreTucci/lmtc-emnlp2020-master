That list includes all member countries of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n(2) Tropical ornamental fish are not susceptible to the diseases listed in Annex A to Directive 91/67/EEC and pose a relatively low risk to the animal health situation in the Community. OIE membership has been deemed as fulfilling the criteria, as referred to in Article 19(2) of Directive 91/67/EEC, that third countries should comply with to be allowed to export tropical ornamental fish to the Community, as it ensures notification of any aquatic animal health event to the other OIE members.\n(3) The Maldives was an important exporter of tropical ornamental fish to some Member States but is not yet a member of the OIE. However, by letter dated 9 May 2007, the Maldives committed itself to join the OIE and to fulfil the obligations deriving from such membership in the interim period before it officially becomes a member of the OIE.\n(4) The Maldives should be included in Part II of Annex I to Decision 2006/656/EC before it officially joins the OIE.
