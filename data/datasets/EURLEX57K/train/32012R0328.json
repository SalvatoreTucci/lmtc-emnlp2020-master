The strategy to implement the telematic applications for freight services (TAF) TSI should not only rely on compliance of subsystems with the TSI but it should also be based on a coordinated implementation.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 62/2006 of 23 December 2005 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the telematic applications for freight subsystem of the trans-European conventional rail system\u00a0(2) should be aligned with Chapter 7 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 454/2011 of 5 May 2011 on the technical specifications for interoperability relating to the subsystem \u2018telematics applications for passenger services\u2019 of the trans-European rail system\u00a0(3) where relevant.\n(4) In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 62/2006, the representative bodies of the European railway sector have sent a Strategic European Deployment Plan (SEDP) for the implementation of the Telematics Applications for Freight to the European Commission. This work should be taken into account by modifying Annex A to the Annex. Annex A refers to the detailed specifications that are the basis for the development of the TAF system. These documents need to be put under a change management process. Through this process, the Agency should update these documents in order to clarify what the baseline is for the implementation.\n(5) The individual schedules of the SEDP submitted in 2007 are outdated. Railway undertakings, infrastructures managers and wagon keepers should therefore submit to the Commission through the Steering Committee their detailed schedules indicating the intermediate steps, deliverables and dates for the implementation of the individual TAF TSI functions. Any divergence from schedules of the SEDP should be duly justified with the mitigating measures undertaken to limit further delays. This work should be based on the assumption that change requests processed in accordance with Section 7.2.2 of the Annex would be validated.\n(6) There is a need to inform all addressees of their obligations in this Regulation, in particular small freight operators which are not members of the representative bodies of the European railway sector.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 62/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["The following Articles 4a, 4b and 4c shall be inserted to Regulation (EC) No 62/2006:\n\u2018Article 4a\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Railway undertakings, infrastructures managers and wagon keepers shall develop and deploy the computerised system in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 7 of the Annex to this Regulation, and in particular in accordance with the functional requirement specifications and with the master plan referred to in Section 7.1.2.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Railway undertakings, infrastructures managers and wagon keepers shall submit to the Commission through the Steering Committee referred to in Section 7.1.4 of the Annex not later than 13 May 2012 the master plan referred to in Section 7.1.2 based on their detailed schedules indicating the intermediate steps, deliverables and dates for the implementation of the individual TAF TSI functions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They shall report on their progress to the Commission through the Steering Committee referred to in Section 7.1.4 of the Annex following the provisions of Chapter 7 of the Annex to this Regulation.", "b\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall publish the master plan referred to in Section 7.1.2, and keep it up to date.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall update the documents referred to in Annex A on the basis of change requests that are validated before 13 May 2012 in accordance with the change management process described in Section 7.2.2.

This shall involve setting the policy, the strategic direction and prioritisation. In doing so, the Steering Committee shall also take into account the interests of small undertakings, new entrants, and railway undertaking providing specific services.\n2. The Steering Committee shall monitor the implementation progress. It shall regularly report to the European Commission about the progress achieved compared with the master plan, at least four times a year. The Steering Committee shall make the necessary steps to adjust above development in the case of a deviation from the master plan.\n3. The Steering Committee shall be composed by\n\u2014 the representative bodies from the railway sector acting on a European level as defined in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004/EC (\u201cthe rail sector representative bodies\u201d),\n\u2014 the European Railway Agency, and\n\u2014 the Commission.\n4. This Steering Committee shall be co-chaired by (a) the Commission and (b) a person nominated by the rail sector representative bodies. The Commission assisted by the members of the Steering Committee shall draft the rules of procedure of this Steering Committee, on which the Steering Committee shall agree.\n5. The members of the Steering Committee may propose to the Steering Committee that other organisations be included as observers where there are sound technical and organisational reasons for doing so.\nThe Stakeholders\nThe railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and wagon keepers shall set up an efficient project governance structure which enables the TAF system to be efficient developed and deployed.\nAbove stakeholders shall:\n\u2014 provide the necessary efforts and resources needed for the implementation of this Regulation,\n\u2014 comply with the principles of access to the TAF TSI common components which shall be available to all market participants at a unified, transparent and lowest possible service cost structure,\n\u2014 ensure that all market participants have access to all data exchanged required for fulfilling their legal obligations and for the performance of their functions in accordance with the TAF TSI functional requirements,\n\u2014 protect the confidentiality of customer relationships,\n\u2014 set-up a mechanism which will enable \u201clatecomers\u201d to join the TAF development and to profit from achieved TAF developments related to the common components in a way which is satisfactory both for above stakeholders and for the \u201cnewcomers\u201d in particular with a view to fair cost sharing,\n\u2014 report of progress with implementation plans to the TAF Steering Committee. This reporting includes also \u2014 where appropriate \u2014 deviations from the master plan.\nThe Representative Bodies\nThe Representative Bodies from the railway sector acting on a European level as defined in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004/EC shall have the following roles and responsibilities:\n\u2014 represent their individual stakeholder members at the TAF TSI Steering Committee,\n\u2014 raise awareness of their members on their obligations related to the implementation of the present Regulation,\n\u2014 ensure current and complete access for all above stakeholders to status information on the work of the Steering Committee and any other groups in order to safeguard each representative\u2019s interests in the implementation of TAF TSI in a timely manner,\n\u2014 ensure the efficient information flow from their individual stakeholder members to the TAF Steering Committee so that the stakeholders\u2019 interest is duly taken into account for decisions affecting the TAF development and deployment,\n\u2014 ensure the efficient information flow from the TAF Steering Committee to their individual stakeholder members so that the stakeholders are duly informed about decisions affecting the TAF development and deployment.\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change management\n7.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change management process\nChange management procedures shall be designed to ensure that the costs and benefits of change are properly analysed and that changes are implemented in a controlled way. These procedures shall be defined, put in place, supported and managed by the European Railway Agency and shall include:\n\u2014 the identification of the technical constraints underpinning the change,\n\u2014 a statement of who takes responsibility for the change implementation procedures,\n\u2014 the procedure for validating the changes to be implemented,\n\u2014 the policy for change management, release, migration and roll-out,\n\u2014 the definition of the responsibilities for the management of the detailed specifications and for both its quality assurance and configuration management.\nThe Change Control Board (CCB) shall be composed of the European Railway Agency, rail sector representative bodies and national safety authorities. Such an affiliation of the parties shall ensure a perspective on the changes that are to be made and an overall assessment of their implications. The Commission may add further parties to the CCB if their participation is seen to be necessary. The CCB ultimately shall be brought under the aegis of the European Railway Agency.\n7.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific change management process for documents listed in Annex A to this Regulation\nThe change control management for the documents listed in Annex A to this Regulation shall be established by the European Railway Agency in accordance with the following criteria:\n1. The change requests affecting the documents are submitted either via the National Safety Authorities (NSA), or via the representative bodies from the railway sector acting on a European level as defined in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004, or via the TAF TSI Steering Committee. The Commission may add further submitting parties if their contribution is seen to be necessary.\n2. The European Railway Agency shall gather and store the change requests.\n3. The European Railway Agency shall present change requests to the dedicated ERA working party, which will evaluate them and prepare a proposal accompanied by an economic evaluation, where appropriate.\n4. Afterwards the European Railway Agency shall present the change request and the associated proposal to the change control board that will or will not validate or postpone the change request.\n5. If the change request is not validated, the European Railway Agency shall send back to the requester either the reason for the rejection or a request for additional information about the draft change request.\n6. The document shall be amended on the basis of validated change requests.\n7. The European Railway Agency shall submit a recommendation to update Annex A to the Commission together with the draft new version of the document, the change requests and their economic evaluation.\n8. The European Railway Agency shall make the draft new version of the document and the validated change requests available on its web site.\n9. Once the update of Annex A is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the European Railway Agency shall make the new version of the document available on its web site.\nWhere change control management affects elements which are in common use within the TAP TSI, the changes shall be made so as to remain as close as possible to the implemented TAP TSI in order to achieve optimum synergies.\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX A\nLIST OF ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS\nList of mandatory specifications\nIndex N Reference Document Name Version\n5 ERA_FRS_TAF_A_Index_5.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX A.5: Figures and Sequence Diagrams of the TAF TSI Messages 1.0\nAppendix Reference Document Name Version\nA ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_A.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX A (WAGON/ILU TRIP PLANNING) 1.0\nB ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_B.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX B \u2014 WAGON AND INTERMODAL UNIT OPERATING DATABASE (WIMO) 1.0\nB \u2014 Annex 1 ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_B_Annex_1.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX B \u2014 WAGON AND INTERMODAL UNIT OPERATING DATABASE (WIMO) \u2014 ANNEX 1: WIMO DATA 1.0\nC ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_C.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX C \u2014 REFERENCE FILES 1.0\nD ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_D.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX D \u2014 INFRASTRUCTURE RESTRICTION NOTICE DATA 1.0\nE ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_E.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX E \u2014 COMMON INTERFACE 1.0\nF ERA_FRS_TAF_D_2_Appendix_F.doc TAF TSI \u2014 ANNEX D.2: APPENDIX F \u2014 TAF TSI DATA AND MESSAGE MODEL 1.0\u2019"}
