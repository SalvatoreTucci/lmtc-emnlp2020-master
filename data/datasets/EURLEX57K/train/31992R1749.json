whereas, for such fixing, it is appropriate that account be taken of the regional variations  which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, might be expected to occur in the price of sugar under natural conditions of price formation on the market;\nWhereas a deficit supply situation is to be foreseen in the areas of production in Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom;\nWhereas Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that an intervention price for raw sugar shall be fixed; whereas such price should be established on the basis of the intervention price for white sugar;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1748/92 fixed the basic price for beet at ECU 40 per tonne; whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the minimum price to be fixed for A beet shall be 98 % of the basic price of the beet and the  minimum price to be fixed for B beet shall in principle be 68 % of the said basic price, without prejudice to Article 28 (5) of that Regulation;\nWhereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the threshold price for white sugar shall be equal to the target price, plus costs, calculated at a flat rate, of transport from the Community area having the largest surplus to the  most distant deficit consumption area in the Community, plus a flat-rate amount which takes into account the storage levy; whereas, given the state of supplies within the Community, account should be taken of transport charges between the departments of  northern France and Palermo;\nWhereas the threshold price for raw sugar is to be derived from the threshold price for white sugar by reference to a processing margin and a standard yield;\nWhereas the threshold price for molasses should be fixed in such a way that the receipts from sales of molasses may reach the level of receipts of undertakings taken into account in the fixing of basic prices for beet;\nWhereas Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1716/92 provide that, for the first stage of the alignment of the prices for sugar and beet in Spain, an intervention price for white sugar and a basic price and minimum prices for beet are to be fixed  taking account in particular of a reducing factor with respect to a reference price; whereas, for the 1992/93 marketing year, the reducing factor with respect to the reference price is ECU 3,44 per 100 kilograms of white sugar and ECU 2,836 per tonne of  beet; whereas pursuant to Article 5 of that Regulation account should be taken of the corresponding common prices to be fixed for that marketing year for the purposes of fixing the prices for sugar and beet applicable in Spain;\nWhereas Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 of 20 June 1977 laying down general rules for offsetting storage costs for sugar and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 750/68 (5) provides that the amount of repayment in the context of the  compensation for storage costs shall be fixed per month and per unit of weight, taking account of financing costs, insurance costs and specific storage costs; whereas, as a result of the maintenance of prices, interest of 10 % should continue to be  levied for financing costs, that is a monthly sum of ECU 0,52 per 100 kilograms of white sugar;\nWhereas, at the end of the period of transition applicable to Portugal in the sugar sector, in other words from the 1992/93 marketing year, the price of white sugar applicable in Portugal must, in accordance with Article 238 (2) of the Act of Accession,  reach the common price after seven staged increases; whereas, as stated in the proceedings of the conference which preceded the accession of Portugal, the common reference price in question is the derived intervention price applicable in the  Ireland/United Kingdom area, in this case for the 1992/93 marketing year; whereas, moreover, the supply situation is still in a structural deficit in all Portuguese production areas; whereas, the results of the regionalization applicable to date in the  Ireland/United Kingdom production area are also valid in the Portuguese area; whereas, therefore, a derived intervention price should also be fixed for white sugar for all the areas in Portugal for the 1992/93 marketing year;\nWhereas the case where beet prices in Portugal are higher than the common prices is regulated by Article 238 (3) (a) and (b) of the Act of Accession, which stipulates that where the price of a product in Portugal is higher than the common price, on the  one hand, the alignment results from the development of common prices during the seven years following accession, and on the other, the Council must carry out an analysis of the development of moves towards price alignment on the basis of an opinion  from the Commission;\nWhereas that analysis has shown that the anticipated alignment as a result of the supposed increase in common prices for beet has not taken place because they have in general been maintained and even reduced; whereas, however, the Portuguese prices of  beet have been adapted in order to stop the gap between Portuguese and common prices from widening;\nWhereas the gap between the Portuguese price of beet and the common reference price of beet, that is, the basic price plus, in accordance with the proceedings of the conference which preceded accession, the effect of regionalization for the  Ireland/United Kingdom area, is less than the 3 % fixed in Article 237 of the Act of Accession and therefore can be considered as minimal; whereas, therefore, the alignment of the price of sugar is achieved from the 1992/93 marketing year; whereas,  therefore, the minimum prices of beet applicable to Portugal can now justifiably be set in accordance with Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, which means that from the 1992/93 marketing year, they are established on the basis of the derived  intervention price for white sugar fixed for all the areas of Portugal,", "main_body": ["For the deficit areas of the Community, the derived intervention price for white sugar shall be fixed, per 100 kilograms, at:\n(a) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in the United Kingdom;\n(b) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in Ireland;\n(c) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in Portugal;\n(d) ECU 54,95 for all the areas in Italy.", "The intervention price of raw sugar shall be ECU 43,94 per 100 kilograms.", "1.
