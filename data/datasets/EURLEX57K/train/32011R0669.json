When assessing the need for a licence system, the Commission should take account of the appropriate instruments for the management of the markets and in particular for monitoring the imports.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008\u00a0(2) introduced a licence obligation for imports of fresh apples falling within CN code 0808\u00a010\u00a080 after apple producers in the European Union found themselves in a difficult situation, due, amongst others, to a significant increase in imports of apples from certain third countries of the Southern hemisphere.\n(3) Currently, effective import monitoring can be carried out through other means. In the interest of simplification and for the purpose of alleviating the administrative burden for Member States and operators, the requirement of import licences for apples should be abolished at the end of the current trigger period referred to in Annex XVIII to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 of 7 June 2011 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in respect of the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors\u00a0(3).\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) For sake of clarity it is appropriate to lay down the rules concerning the import licences issued for fresh apples falling within CN code 0808\u00a010\u00a080, and still valid on the date of application of this Regulation.\n(6) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Point G in Part I of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018G.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fruit and vegetables\n(Part IX of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007)\nCN code Description Amount of the security Period of validity Net quantities\u00a0(4)\n0703\u00a020\u00a000 Garlic, fresh or chilled, including products imported under tariff quotas as referred to in Article 1(2)(a)(iii) 50\u00a0EUR/t 3 months from the day of issue in accordance with Article 22(1) (\u2014)\nex\u00a00703\u00a090\u00a000 Other alliaceous vegetables, fresh or chilled, including products imported under tariff quotas as referred to in Article 1(2)(a)(iii) 50\u00a0EUR/t 3 months from the day of issue in accordance with Article 22(1) (\u2014)\n(\u2014) Licence or certificate are required for any quantities.\u2019", "At the request of the interested parties, the securities lodged for the issuing of import licences for fresh apples falling within CN code 0808\u00a010\u00a080, shall be released, when the following conditions are met:\n(a) the validity of the licences has not expired on the date of application of this Regulation;\n(b) the licences have been used only partially or not at all on the date of application of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0114, 26.4.2008, p.\u00a03.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Maximum quantities for which no licence or certificate needs to be presented, pursuant to Article 4(1)(d).
