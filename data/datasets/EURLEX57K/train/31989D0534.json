whereas, in its judgment of 12 July 1988 (4), the Court of Justice confirmed the validity of that Decision;\nWhereas the United Kingdom, by letter received by the Commission on 24 February 1989, requested authorization to extend the said measure for an indefinite period;\nWhereas, in its judgment of 12 July 1988, the Court of Justice ruled inter alia that Article 27 of the Sixth Directive permitted the adoption of a derogating measure such as that at issue on condition that the resultant difference in treatment was justified by objective circumstances;\nWhereas, in order to satisfy itself that this condition is met, the Commission must be informed of any administrative decisions adopted by the tax authorities in connection with the derogation in question;\nWhereas the other Member States were notified of the United Kingdom's request on 22 March 1989; whereas the Council Decision is deemed to have been adopted if, within two months of the other Member States being informed, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be raised by the Council;
