Other  arrangements are permitted, should a manufacturer provide evidence that they have an effect at  least equivalent to the requirements specified in this Directive.\n2.\nSPECIAL REQUIREMENTS\n2.1.\nStarter control\nIt must not be possible to start the engine if there is a risk that this might  cause an uncontrolled movement of the tractor.\nThis requirement is deemed to be fulfilled if the engine cannot be started unless:\n- the gear change lever is in neutral position or in neutral gear, or\n- the gear ratio selection  lever is in neutral position or in neutral gear, or\n- the clutch mechanism is disengaged, or\n- the  hydrostatic device is in neutral position or depressurized, or\n- where hydraulic transmission is  fitted, the engagement device reverts automatically to a neutral position.\n2.2.\nEngine shut-off control\nActuating this device must stop the engine without sustained manual  effort; it must not be possible for the engine to start again automatically.\nShould the engine shut-off control not be combined with the starter control, it must be of a colour  contrasting clearly with the background and the other controls. If the shut-off control is a  button, it must be coloured red.\n2.3.\nDIFFERENTIAL LOCK CONTROL\nIdentification of the control, where fitted, is mandatory. The  functioning of the differential lock must be clearly indicated, if this is not apparent from the  position of the control.\n2.4.\nThree-point lifting mechanism control\n2.4.1.\nEither the three-point lifting mechanism controls must be fitted in such a way as to ensure that  lifting and lowering manoeuvres can be carried out safely, and/or automatic coupling parts should  be fitted on the attachment devices of the lifting equipment so that the presence of an operator  between the\ntractor and the equipment is not required. The presence of such a control, where  fitted, must be indicated.\n2.4.2.\nThe safety requirements for the lifting and lowering of the tools being carried are deemed to be  fulfilled where the following conditions are met:\n2.4.2.1.\nMain controls\nThe main controls and any linkage are arranged or protected in such a way that the  operator is unable to reach them if he is standing on the ground between the tractor and the  mounted implement, or external controls must be fitted;\n2.4.2.2.\nExternal controls\n2.4.2.2.1.\nThe controls must be laid out in such a way that the operator can actuate them from a non-dangerous  spot, for instance where the three-point hydraulic lift controls or the additional controls for the  lifting mechanism are located outside the vertical planes formed by the internal walls of the  mudguards,\nand\n2.4.2.2.2.\nThe three-point hydraulic lifting mechanism is actuated by means of controls which restrict the  amount of movement to a maximum of 100 millimetres each time the control is actuated. The  measurement points in this case are formed by the coupling points on the lower arms of the  three-point coupling,\nor\n2.4.2.2.3.\nThe three-point hydraulic lifting mechanism is actuated by means of controls which operate on the  dead-man's control;\n2.4.2.3.\nNarrow tractors\nIn the case of tractors with one driven axle having a fixed or adjustable minimum  track not exceeding 1 150 millimetres, the main controls must be located in front of the vertical  plane passing through the seat reference point, the seat being in a central position;\n2.4.2.4.\nOther arrangements are permitted if the manufacturer provides evidence that they have an effect at  least equivalent to the requirements set out in 2.4.2.1., 2.4.2.2. and 2.4.2.3.\nEWG:L333UMBE02.94\nFF: 3UEN;   SETUP: 01;   Hoehe: 511 mm;   72 Zeilen;   4777 Zeichen;\nBediener:  MIKE   Pr.: C;\nKunde: ................................\nANNEX III\nSYMBOLS\n1. >START OF GRAPHIC>\nStarter control\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n>START OF  GRAPHIC>\n2.
