Depending on the equivalence or non-equivalence of those measures with those required by the Community, Annex VII of the Agreement provides that appropriate official health certificates should be used in the trade of fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products with New Zealand.\n(2) Commission Decision 2003/56/EC\u00a0(2) lays down the certification requirements and provides models for official health certificates to be used for the importation from New Zealand of live animals and animal products. In cases where full equivalence of sanitary measures has been determined, simplified certificates may be used, models for which are set out in Annexes II to V to that Decision.\n(3) Account should be taken of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 650/2003\u00a0(4), and of recent acknowledgements of equivalence of sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products, fishery products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand.\n(4) Decision 2003/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and VII to Decision 2003/56/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 13 December 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 57, 26.2.1997, p. 4.
