Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Withdrawal of the complaint and termination of the proceeding\n(7) By its letter of 1 April 2010 to the Commission, EIFI formally withdrew its complaint.\n(8) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia, currently falling within CN codes 7318\u00a012\u00a010, 7318\u00a014\u00a010, 7318\u00a015\u00a030, 7318\u00a015\u00a051, 7318\u00a015\u00a061 and 7318\u00a015\u00a070, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 190, 13.8.2009, p. 27.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 190, 13.8.2009, p. 32."}
