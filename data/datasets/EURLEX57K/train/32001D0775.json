The apparatus shall be equipped with sixteen 2 MHz ultrasonic transducers (Krautkr\u00e4mer, SFK 2 NP), with an operating distance between transducers of 25 mm.\nThe ultrasonic data shall comprise measurements of backfat thickness and muscle thickness.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content using a computer.\n3. The carcasse's lean meat content shall be calculated on the basis of 35 measurement points using the following formula:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nwhere:\ny= the estimated lean meat content of the carcass.\n4. Descriptions of the measuring points and the statistical method can be found in Part II of the Spanish protocol forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcasses weighing between 60 and 110 kilograms.\""}
