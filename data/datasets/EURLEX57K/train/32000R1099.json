PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\n(1) By Regulation (EC) No 397/1999 the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of bicycles falling within CN codes 8712 00 10, 8712 00 30 and 8712 00 80 originating in Taiwan. Sampling was applied to Taiwanese exporting producers and individual duty rates ranging from 2,4 % to 18,2 % were imposed on the companies in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample were attributed a weighted average duty rate of 5,4 %. A duty rate of 18,2 % was imposed on companies which either did not make themselves known or did not cooperate in the investigation.\n(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 397/1999 stipulates that where any new exporting producer in Taiwan provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that:\n- it did not export to the Community the products described in Article 1(1) of that Regulation during the investigation period (1 November 1996 to 31 October 1997),\n- it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in Taiwan which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation,\n- it has actually exported to the Community the products concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community,\nthen Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 397/1999 may be amended by granting that exporting producer the duty rate applicable to cooperating producers which were not included in the sample, namely 5,4 %.\nB. NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS' REQUESTS\n(3) Four new Taiwanese exporting producers, after having applied not to be treated differently from the companies which cooperated in the original investigation but were not included in the sample, have provided, on request, evidence showing that they meet the requirements set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 397/1999. The evidence provided by these applicant companies is considered sufficient to allow that Regulation to be amended by adding these four new exporting producers to the Annex thereto. That Annex specifies the Taiwanese exporting producers which are subject to the weighted average duty rate of 5,4 %,", "main_body": ["The following companies shall be added to the list of exporting producers from Taiwan listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 397/1999:\n- Chien Chin Frame Co.
