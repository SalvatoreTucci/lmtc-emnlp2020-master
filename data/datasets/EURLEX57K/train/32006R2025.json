Moreover, experience has shown that certain provisions of that Regulation need to be simplified or clarified.\n(2) From 2007 onwards, hemp produced for other uses than fibre will, pursuant to Chapter 4 of Title III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, be allowed as a land use under the single payment scheme. In this respect a contract or commitment for the hemp produced is no longer required. As a consequence, Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 should be adapted accordingly.\n(3) The aid to sugar beet and cane producers provided for in Chapter 10f of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 is, due to its nature, not related to agricultural area. The provisions concerning the single application under Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 should therefore not apply to that aid scheme. Provisions should subsequently be made for an appropriate application procedure. Moreover, since farmers are not bound anymore to declare separately the areas used for sugar beet or cane production, the provisions to draw an additional control sample from the farmers applying for the aid to sugar and cane producers should be abolished.\n(4) In order to harmonise the rules under the area-related aid schemes and to simplify the administration and the controls of the applications for aid, features referred to in acts listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, or which may form part of the good agricultural and environmental condition as referred to in Article 5 of that Regulation and Annex IV thereto, shall be eligible not only for the single payment scheme but for all area-related aid schemes.\n(5) Article 54(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 requires that set-aside entitlements are to be claimed before any other entitlements. In order to ensure equal treatment of farmers who do not have all the required set-aside area available to claim for all their set-aside entitlements, the provisions set out in Article 50(4) of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 should be clarified.\n(6) Reductions of payments to be applied by way of off-setting against payments the following three years, and recovery of undue payment, are only possible against payments provided for under Titles III, IV and IVa of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. The off-setting and recovery payments should also be possible against payments of the additional amount of aid provided for in Article 12 of that Regulation.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
