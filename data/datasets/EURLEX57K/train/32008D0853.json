In particular, Cyprus applies improved irrigation techniques in almost 95\u00a0% of the area under irrigation and has introduced water pricing policies and punitive measures to discourage excessive water consumption and losses, as well as promoted and provided incentives for the installation of water recycling systems in houses. Furthermore, Cyprus' National Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 already includes a number of measures to improve the use of water.\n(6) Since the income of Cypriot farmers affected by the drought has been drastically reduced, they face the serious risk of not having the financial means to meet the immediate needs of their families and to start a new season, leading to an imminent danger of land abandonment, soil erosion and desertification.\n(7) The State aid to be granted amounts to EUR 67,5 million and will benefit 34\u00a0000 eligible farmers and 3\u00a0000 livestock keepers.\n(8) In order to be effective, the State aid must be granted and accessed by farmers as soon as possible.\n(9) The Commission has not at this stage given an opinion on the nature and compatibility of the aid.\n(10) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the emergency situation which has risen, to be compatible with the common market,", "main_body": ["Exceptional additional aid by the Cypriot authorities to the agricultural sector, amounting to a maximum of EUR 67,5 million, shall be considered to be compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Cyprus."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 20 October 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.-L.
