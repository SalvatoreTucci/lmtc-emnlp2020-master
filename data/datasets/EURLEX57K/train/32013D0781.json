The derogation granted by Decision 2009/431/EC, in the years 2009-2012 concerned approximately 110\u00a0000 livestock units (corresponding to 0,9\u00a0% of the total), 45\u00a0000 hectares of grassland (corresponding to 0,4\u00a0% of the total) and 5\u00a0000 hectares of arable land (corresponding to 0,1\u00a0% of the total), in Great Britain.\n(4) On 20 December 2012, the United Kingdom submitted to the Commission a request for renewal of the derogation under the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to the same conditions as those laid down in Decision 2009/431/EC.\n(5) The United Kingdom has established Action Programmes for the period 2013-2016, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 91/676/EEC, by means of the following regulations: the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/2349) and amending regulations SI 2009/3160, SI 2012/1849, SI 2013/1001 and SI 2013/2619 in England; the Action Programme for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones Regulations 2008 (Scottish SI 2008/298) and amending regulations Scottish SI 2013/123 in Scotland; the Nitrate Pollution Prevention (Wales) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/2506 (W. 245)) in Wales.\n(6) The designated vulnerable zones to which the action programmes apply, according to Regulation SI 2013/2619 for England, Scottish SI 2002 No 276 and Scottish SI 2002 No 546 for Scotland and Regulation SI 2013/2506 (W. 245) for Wales, cover 58\u00a0% of the total area of England, 14\u00a0% of the total area of Scotland and 2,3\u00a0% of the total area of Wales.\n(7) Water quality data submitted show that for groundwater in England 85\u00a0% of groundwater bodies have mean nitrate concentrations below 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate and 60\u00a0% concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l nitrate. For Wales, 95\u00a0% of groundwater bodies have mean nitrate concentrations of less than 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate, and 87\u00a0% have concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l. For Scotland over 87\u00a0% of groundwater bodies have mean nitrate concentrations of less than 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate, and 62\u00a0% have concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l. For surface waters in England 59\u00a0% of monitoring sites have mean nitrate concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l and 8\u00a0% have concentrations over 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate. For Scotland and Wales over 95\u00a0% of monitoring sites have mean nitrate concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l. For Scotland no monitoring sites have mean nitrate concentrations over 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate and for Wales 1\u00a0% of monitoring sites have concentrations over 50\u00a0mg/l nitrate.\n(8) The Commission, after examination of the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in the light of the experience gained from the derogation provided for in Decision 2009/431/EC considers that the amount of manure proposed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 250\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(9) The supporting documents presented by the United Kingdom show that the proposed amount of 250\u00a0kg per hectare per year nitrogen from grazing livestock manure in grassland farms is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as high net precipitation, long growing seasons and high yields of grass with high nitrogen uptake.\n(10) Decision 2009/431/EC has an expiration date of 31 December 2012. For the purpose of ensuring that the farmers concerned may continue to benefit from the derogation, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2009/431/EC.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["The derogation requested by the United Kingdom with regard to England, Scotland and Wales by letter of 20 December 2012, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018grassland farms\u2019 means holdings where 80\u00a0% or more of the agricultural area available for manure application is grass;\n(b) \u2018grazing livestock\u2019 means cattle (with the exclusion of veal calves), sheep, deer, goats and horses;\n(c) \u2018grass\u2019 means permanent grassland or temporary grassland (temporary implying leys of less than four years);\n(d) \u2018parcel\u2019 means an individual field or a group of fields, homogeneous regarding cropping, soil type and fertilisation practices.", "Scope\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis to grassland farms and subject to the conditions prescribed in Articles 4, 5 and 6.", "Annual application and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farmers who want to benefit from derogation under this Decision shall submit an application to the competent authorities annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the annual application referred to in paragraph 1, they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.", "Application of manure and other fertilisers\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of livestock manure from grazing livestock applied to the land each year on grassland farms, including by the animals themselves, shall not exceed the amount of manure containing 250\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare, subject to the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total nitrogen inputs shall not exceed the foreseeable nutrient demand of the considered crop, shall take into account the supply from the soil, and shall not exceed the maximum application standard applying to the farm, established in the Nitrates Action Programme.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fertilisation plan shall be kept for each farm describing the crop rotation of the farmland and the planned application of manure and other fertilisers.
