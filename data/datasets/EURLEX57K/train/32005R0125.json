The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76\u00a0(2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.\n(4) The maximum export refund for rend, medium and long A rice was fixed at a relatively low level. Consequently, it is not justified for the moment to fix a common right to refund for rice.\n(5) Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.\n(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.\n(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.\n(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.\n(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.\n(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.", "The issue of export licences with advance fixing of the
