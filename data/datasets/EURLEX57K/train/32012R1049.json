It considers that the chemical and toxicological data available for polyglycitol syrup are insufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake. However, it concludes, on the basis of the available data, that there are no indications of a safety concern for the proposed uses and use levels.\n(6) There is a technological need for the use of polyglycitol syrup as an alternative polyol for the other already authorised polyols. Polyglycitol syrup is less sweet and provides more bulk, opacity, binding and stability in energy-reduced or sugar-free products. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories applied for and to assign E 964 as E-number to that food additive.\n(7) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories concerned before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to that food additive.\n(8) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2009;7(12):1413.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in point 2 of Part B the following entry for E 964 is inserted after the entry for E 962:\n\u2018E 964 Polyglycitol syrup\u2019\n(2) in Part E the following entries for E 964 are inserted in numerical order in the relevant food categories:\n\u201803.
