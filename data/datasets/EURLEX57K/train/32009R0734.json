Significant volumes of imports of steel ropes and cables from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increased volume of imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.\n(10) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.\n(11) Should circumvention practices via the Republic of Korea and Malaysia covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may also cover these practices.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(12) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of steel ropes and cables consigned from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, whether declared as originating in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n(13) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People\u2019s Republic of China, to the known importers and to the known associations of importers in the Community and to the authorities of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.\n(14) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.\n(15) The authorities of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea and Malaysia will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(16) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exemption of registration of imports or measures\n(17) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.\n(18) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers of the product under investigation that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGISTRATION\n(19) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(20) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n(21) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party\u2019s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(22) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(23) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHEDULE FOR THE INVESTIGATION\n(24) The investigation will be concluded, according to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(25) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4).\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(26) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.
