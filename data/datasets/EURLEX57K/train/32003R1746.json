However, it currently only requires such data in respect of the Member States of the European Union (EU) at the time of its adoption. It therefore has to be amended so as to extend the reporting requirements to data in respect of the countries acceding to the EU on 1 May 2004.\n(2) Currently, most data in respect of the said countries are unlikely to be significant. The benefit of separately identifying insignificant data is likely to be less than the costs associated with its collection. In line with the already existing flexibility permitted by Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) in the calculation of quarterly figures where it can be shown from figures collected at a higher level of aggregation that the data involved are unlikely to be significant, the principle of flexibility should also be applied in respect of reporting of the new data. For this purpose, the national central banks regularly assess if data are significant or not.\n(3) Further amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) are required due to the codification of Regulation of the European Central Bank (EC) No 2818/98 (ECB/1998/15) of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves(3),", "main_body": ["Regulation ECB/2001/13 is amended as follows:\n1.

Each NCB informs the reporting agents of such a decision.\";\n(ii) The following paragraph 7a is inserted:\n\"7a. Reporting agents report data in respect of the cells not marked with the '>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>' symbol in Table 4 of Part 2.\nReporting agents also report data in respect of the cells marked with the '>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>' symbol.

NCBs decide when they need to receive data from reporting agents in order to meet this deadline.\";\n(b) Part 2 is amended as follows:\n(i) in Table 3 (Country breakdown):\n- under the heading \"B.
