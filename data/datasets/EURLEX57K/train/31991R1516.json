whereas, by way of derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Regulation (EEC) No 4161/87 (1) lays down  consequent on the entry into force of the combined nomenclature, the basic duties to be adopted within the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of  Spain and Portugal; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the imports of these wines Community tariff quotas should be opened for the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992 for the abovementioned wines at duties as shown in the list  in Article 1;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade in agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question  coming from Spain;

whereas it is therefore necessary to apply a duty equal to zero where the value of the specific customs duties does not exceed 2 % ad valorem;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are  exhausted; whereas they should not be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to a procedure laid down in Article 3;
