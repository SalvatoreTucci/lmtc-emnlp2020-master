It provides that the commodities may only be imported into and transit through the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in columns 1 and 3 of the table in Part 1 of Annex\u00a0I thereto.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also lays down the conditions for a third country, territory, zone or compartment to be considered as free from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\n(3) Canada is listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as a third country from which imports into and transit through the Union of the commodities is authorised from the whole of its territory.\n(4) An Agreement between the Union and Canada\u00a0(4) provides for a swift mutual recognition of regionalisation measures in the event of outbreaks of a disease in the Union or in Canada (\u2018the Agreement\u2019).\n(5) On 4 December 2014, Canada confirmed the presence of HPAI of subtype H5N2 on its territory and it may therefore no longer be considered as free from that disease. The veterinary authorities of Canada immediately suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of commodities intended for export to the Union. Canada has also implemented a stamping-out policy in order to control HPAI and limit its spread.\n(6) Canada has submitted information on the epidemiological situation on its territory and the measures it has taken to prevent the further spread of HPAI which has now been evaluated by the Commission. On the basis of that evaluation, as well as the commitments laid down in the Agreement and the guarantees provided by Canada, it is appropriate to conclude that limiting the restrictions on the introduction into the Union of commodities to the area affected by HPAI, which the veterinary authorities of Canada have placed under restrictions due to the current outbreaks, should be sufficient to cover the risks associated with the introduction into the Union of the commodities.\n(7) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a074.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (OJ L\u00a0226, 23.8.2008, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products as approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 1999/201/EC (OJ\u00a0L\u00a071, 18.3.1999, p.\u00a03).\nANNEX\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for Canada is replaced by the following:\nISO code and name of third country or territory Code of third country, territory, zone or compartment Description of third country, territory, zone or compartment Veterinary certificate Specific conditions Specific conditions Avian influenza surveillance status Avian influenza vaccination status Salmonella control status (7)\nModel(s) Additional guarantees Closing date (1) Opening date (2)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 6A 6B 7 8 9\n\u2018CA \u2014 Canada CA-0 Whole country SPF\nEP, E       S4\nCA-1 The whole country of Canada excluding area CA-2 BPR, BPP, DOC, DOR, HEP, HER, SRA, SRP  N   A  S1, ST1\nWGM VIII\nPOU, RAT  N\nCA-2 Area of Canada described as \u201cPrimary Control Zone\u201d within delimited by the following boundaries:\n\u2014 on the west, the Pacific Ocean;\n\u2014 on the south, the border to the United States of America;\n\u2014 on the north, Highway 16;\n\u2014 on the east, the border between the Provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.\nPOU, RAT  N"}
