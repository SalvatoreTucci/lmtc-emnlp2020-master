Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (MUCL 39199) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) is authorised for chickens for fattening without a time limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005\u00a0(4), and provisionally for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2013/2001\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105), endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) is authorised for chickens for fattening without a time limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 833/2005\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to turkeys for fattening. EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years.\n(8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) for chickens for fattening. EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years.\n(9) The assessment of those applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(7).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised for use without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, are authorised for use for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 September 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
