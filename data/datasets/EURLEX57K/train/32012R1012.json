The vector species for epizootic ulcerative syndrome are currently included in that list.\n(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 sets out, inter alia, the list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which the import into the Union of ornamental fish susceptible to one or more of the diseases listed in Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC and intended for closed ornamental facilities is permitted.\n(6) India and Vietnam are listed in that Annex to make the import of fish species susceptible to epizootic ulcerative syndrome subject to specific animal health provisions eliminating the risks of that disease.\n(7) In addition, the model animal health certificates set out in Parts A and B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 contain animal health attestations with regard to the requirements for susceptible species and vector species to certain diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, including epizootic ulcerative syndrome.\n(8) Directive 2006/88/EC, as amended by Commission Implementing Directive 2012/31/EU\u00a0(6), no longer lists epiizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) as an exotic disease in Part II of Annex IV thereto.\n(9) For reasons of consistency and clarity of Union law, Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should be amended in order to remove the provisions therein making references to epizootic ulcerative syndrome.\n(10) Following the removal of epizootic ulcerative syndrome from the list in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC the corresponding animal health provisions applicable to India and Vietnam have become redundant and therefore those countries should be removed from the list of countries that are to apply disease specific animal health measures to aquatic animals intended for export to the Union.\n(11) Thailand is listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, as a third county from which imports of cyprinidae intended for farming, relaying areas, put and take fisheries and open and closed ornamental facilities into the Union is permitted. Thailand has request to be listed in Annex III for the purposes of permitting exports of also other fish species from that third country into the Union.\n(12) An inspection by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) concerning aquatic animal health was carried out in Thailand in November 2009. The FVO recommendations following that inspection have been satisfactorily implemented by the competent authority in Thailand. It is therefore appropriate to permit imports into the Union from that third country also of other fish species. The entry for Thailand in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) It is appropriate to provide for transitional measures to allow Member States and the industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the requirements laid down in
