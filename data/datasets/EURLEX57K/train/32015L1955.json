It encompasses a genetic system which naturally occurs in the cytoplasm of plants. That genetic system can be introduced into plants by means of crossing. On the basis of that technique, the genetic diversity of two or more parent lines can be combined. Therefore the performance of those varieties, in areas such as disease resistance and yields, can be improved. In view of that technical development it is appropriate to establish specific conditions for hybrid varieties of barley.\n(3) Taking into account the technical similarities with the production of seeds of hybrids of rye and the needs of the users of the seed of hybrids of barley, it is appropriate to set out conditions for that seed similar to the conditions applying for the seeds of hybrids of rye.\n(4) Experience has shown that the specific blend production system applied in the field, in combination with the weather related risks during the flowering period, would require a reduction of the varietal purity standard to 85 %, in the case the CMS technique is applied, allowing stable seed production under less favourable weather conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to allow a lower level of varietal purity than required for other hybrids.\n(5) Annexes I and II to Directive 66/402/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 66/402/EEC\nAnnexes I and II to Directive 66/402/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 June 2016 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
