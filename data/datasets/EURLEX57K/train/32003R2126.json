In view of the accession of these countries to the Community on 1 May 2004, the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted for the products in question may result in speculative trade flows.\n(4) To prevent any abuse through the reimportation or reintroduction into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund or levy should be fixed for these countries for the products listed in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2003.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1290/2003 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) In view of the dates for the invitations to tender, this Regulation must enter into force immediately.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2003 is hereby replaced by:\n\"1.
