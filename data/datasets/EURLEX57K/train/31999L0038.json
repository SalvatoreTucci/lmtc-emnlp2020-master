whereas it is highly probable that other types of hardwood dust can also cause cancer in humans; whereas therefore the workers concerned are exposed to a serious potential risk of developing cancer;\n(9) Whereas the precautionary principle should be applied in the protection of workers' health; whereas therefore Directive 90/394/EEC should be extended to cover all types of hardwood dusts;\n(10) Whereas further research is desirable into the carcinogenicity of other wood dusts; whereas the Commission is to bring forward proposals to protect the health of workers where a risk is identified;\n(11) Whereas Article 16 of Directive 90/394/EEC makes provision for the establishment of limit values in respect of all those carcinogens for which that is possible, on the basis of the available information, including scientific and technical data;\n(12) Whereas it is appropriate to fix such limit values for hardwood dusts; whereas the current limit values for vinyl chloride monomer should be reduced to reflect best minimum standards for technological practices which reflect feasibility factors while maintaining the aim of ensuring the health of workers at work;\n(13) Whereas workers must be effectively protected from the risks of developing cancer as a result of occupational exposure to hardwood dusts; whereas the aim of this Directive is not to restrict the use of wood either by replacing it with other materials or by replacing the use of certain types of wood with other types of wood;\n(14) Whereas compliance with the minimum requirements on protection of the health and safety of workers from the specific risk related to carcinogens is intended not only to ensure the health and safety protection of each individual worker but also to provide a level of minimum protection for all workers in the Community;\n(15) Whereas a consistent level of protection from the risks related to carcinogens has to be established for the Community as a whole, whereas that level of protection has to be set by a framework of general principles to enable Member States to apply the minimum requirements consistently;\n(16) Whereas the amendments contained in this Directive constitute a practical aspect of the realisation of the social dimension of the internal market;\n(17) Whereas, pursuant to Decision 74/325/EEC(7), the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work is to be consulted by the Commission with a view to drawing up proposals in this field,", "main_body": ["Directive 90/394/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
