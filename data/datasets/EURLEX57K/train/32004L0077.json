Glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt are included in the Community register of flavouring substances laid down by Commission Decision 1999/217/EC of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996\u00a0(3). Exposure to glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt occur mostly via consumption of liquorice confectionery, including chewing gum, herbal teas and other beverages.\n(4) The Scientific Committee on Food, in its opinion of 4 April 2003 on glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt, concluded that an upper limit for regular ingestion of 100\u00a0mg/day provides a sufficient level of protection for the majority of the population, consumption above this level may give rise to hypertension. However the Committee noted that within the human population there are subgroups for which this upper limit might not offer sufficient protection. These subgroups comprise people with medical conditions related to disturbed water- and electrolyte homeostasis.\n(5) These findings make it necessary to provide labelling which gives the consumers clear information on the presence of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in confectionery and beverages. In the case of high contents of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in these products, the consumers, and in particular those suffering from hypertension, should in addition be informed that excessive intake should be avoided. To ensure a good understanding of these information by the consumers, the well known term \u2018liquorice extracts\u2019 should be preferably used.\n(6) Directive 94/54/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex to Directive 94/54/EC is amended in accordance with the text set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall permit trade in products which comply with this Directive from 20 May 2005 at the latest.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall prohibit trade in products which do not comply with this Directive from 20 May 2006.\nHowever, products which do not comply with this Directive and which were labelled before 20 May 2006 shall be authorised while stocks last.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 May 2005 at the latest.
