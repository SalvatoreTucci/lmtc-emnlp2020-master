Those surveys further show that Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte has now established in a large part of the Union territory. In addition, it is not feasible to block its further spread and effective and sustainable means of control minimising the impact of that organism on maize yield exist, in particular the implementation of a crop rotation scheme.\n(2) Decision 2003/766/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/766/EC is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2003/766/EC of 24 October 2003 on emergency measures to prevent the spread within the Community of Diabrotica virgifera Le Conte (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 49)."}
