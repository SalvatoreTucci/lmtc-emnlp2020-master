Therefore, in accordance with the provision of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC\u00a0(2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.\n(3) On 17 April 2007, Syngenta Seeds S.A.S., on behalf of Syngenta Crop Protection AG, submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 8(4) and 20(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the authorisation of existing products produced from GA21 maize (food additives, feed materials and feed additives produced from GA21 maize).\n(4) On 2 October 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a single comprehensive favourable opinion for both applications in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize as described in the applications (the products) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment\u00a0(3). In its opinion, EFSA considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.\n(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.\n(6) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.\n(7) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(4).\n(8) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.\n(9) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(10) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(11) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs.\n(12) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c), of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms\u00a0(6).\n(13) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman. The Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures.\n(14) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. The Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded and that the Commission could finalise the decision-making process. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,", "main_body": ["Genetically modified organism and unique identifier\nGenetically modified maize (Zea mays L.)
