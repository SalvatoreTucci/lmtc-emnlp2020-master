In accordance with Article 6 of Directive 2010/75/EU, such measures can be included in general binding rules.\n(4) The emissions from combustion plants during start-up and shut-down periods are generally at elevated concentrations compared to normal operating conditions. In view of the objective of Directive 2010/75/EU to prevent emissions, those periods should be as short as possible.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 75 of Directive 2010/75/EU,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Decision lays down rules concerning the determination of the start-up and shut-down

2010/75/EU.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision the following definitions apply:\n(1) \u2018minimum start-up load for stable generation\u2019 means the minimum load compatible with the steady operation of the generating combustion plant following start-up initiation after which the plant is able to safely and reliably deliver its output to a network, grid, heat accumulator or industrial site;\n(2) \u2018minimum shut-down load for stable generation\u2019 means the minimum load at which point the plant can no longer safely and reliably deliver its output to a network, grid, heat accumulator or industrial site and is considered to be shutting down.", "General rules for determining start-up and shut-down periods\nFor determining the end of the start-up period and the beginning of the shut-down period, the following rules shall apply:\n(1) the criteria or parameters used to determine start-up and shut-down periods shall be transparent and externally verifiable;\n(2) the determination of start-up and shut-down periods shall be based on conditions allowing a stable generation process safeguarding health and safety;\n(3) periods during which a combustion plant, after start-up, is operating stably and safely with fuel supply but without the export of heat or electricity or mechanical energy shall not be included in the start-up or shut-down periods.", "Determination of start-up and shut-down periods in the permit\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of the determination of start-up and shut-down periods in the permit of the installation

the start point of the shut-down period expressed as load thresholds, in accordance with Articles 6, 7 and 8 and considering that the minimum shut-down load for stable generation may be lower than the minimum start-up load for stable generation as the combustion plant may be able to operate stably at a lower load once it has reached a sufficient temperature following a period of operation;\n(ii) discrete processes or thresholds for operational parameters, which are associated with the end of the start-up period, and with the start of the shut-down period, and which are clear, easily monitored and applicable to the technology used, as set out in Article 9;\n(b) measures ensuring that the start-up and shut-down periods are minimised as far as practicable;\n(c) measures ensuring that all abatement equipment is brought into operation as soon as is technically practicable.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, account shall be taken of the technical and operational characteristics of the combustion plant and its units, and the technical requirements for operating the abatement techniques installed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any aspects relating to the plant that affect start-up and shut-down periods change, including the installed equipment, fuel type, plant role in the system and installed abatement techniques, the permit conditions related to start-up and

shut-down period of the last combustion unit shutting down shall be disregarded;\n(b) the values determined during other start-up and shut-down periods of individual units shall be disregarded only if they are measured or, where no measurement is technically or economically feasible, calculated separately for each of the units concerned.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of point (27) of Article 3 of Directive 2010/75/EU, the start-up and shut-down periods of combustion plants consisting of two or more units shall only consist of the start-up period of the first combustion unit starting up and the shut-down period of the last combustion unit shutting down.\nFor combustion plants for which points 2, 4 and 6 of Part 1 of Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU allow the application of an emission limit value to part of the plant discharging its waste gases through one or more separate flues within a common stack, the start-up and shut-down periods may be determined for each of those parts of the combustion plant separately. The start-up and shut-down periods for a part of the plant shall then consist of the start-up period of the first combustion unit starting up within that part of the plant and the shut-down period of the last combustion unit shutting down within that part of the plant.", "Determination of start-up and shut-down periods for combustion plants generating electricity or delivering power for mechanical drive using load thresholds\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For combustion plants generating electricity and for combustion plants for mechanical drive, the start-up period shall be considered to end at the point when the plant reaches the minimum start-up load for stable generation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shut-down period shall be considered to begin at the initiation of termination of fuel supply after reaching the point of the minimum shut-down load for stable generation from where on generated electricity is no longer available for the grid or generated mechanical power is no longer useful for the mechanical load.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The load thresholds to be used for determining the end of the start-up period and the start of the shut-down period for electricity generating combustion plants and to be included in the plant\u2019s permit shall be a fixed percentage of the rated electrical output of the combustion plant.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The load thresholds to be used for determining the end of the start-up period and the start of the shut-down period for combustion plant for mechanical drive and to be included in the plant\u2019s permit shall be a fixed percentage of the mechanical power output of the combustion plant.", "Determination of start-up and shut-down periods for heat generating combustion plants using load thresholds\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For heat-generating combustion plants, the start-up period shall be considered to end when the plant reaches the minimum start-up load for stable generation and heat can be safely and reliably delivered to a distributing network, to a heat accumulator or used directly on a local industrial site.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shut-down period shall be considered to begin after reaching the minimum shut-down load for stable generation when heat can no longer be safely and reliably delivered to a network or used directly on a local industrial site.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The load thresholds to be used for determining the end of the start-up period and the beginning of the shut-down period for heat generating combustion plants and to be included in the plant\u2019s permit shall be a fixed percentage of the rated thermal output of the combustion plant.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Periods in which heat-generating plants are heating up an accumulator or reservoir without exporting heat shall be considered as operating hours and not as start-up or shut-down periods.", "Determination of start-up and shut-down periods for combustion plants generating heat and electricity using load thresholds\nFor combustion plants generating electricity and heat, the start-up and shut-down periods shall be determined as set out in Articles 6 and 7, taking into account both the electricity and heat generated.", "Determination of start-up and shut-down periods using operational parameters or discrete processes\nFor determining the minimum start-up load and the minimum shut-down load for stable generation, at least three criteria shall be defined, with the end of start-up or start of shut-down periods reached when at least two of the criteria have been met.\nThese criteria shall be chosen from the following:\n(1) discrete processes set out in the Annex or equivalent processes that suit the technical characteristics of the plant;\n(2) thresholds for the operational parameters set out in the Annex, or equivalent operational parameters that suit the technical characteristics of the plant.", "0\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJanez POTO\u010cNIK\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0334, 17.12.2010, p.\u00a017.\nANNEX\nDISCRETE PROCESSES AND OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH START-UP AND SHUT-DOWN PERIODS\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discrete processes associated with the minimum start-up load for stable generation\n1.1.
