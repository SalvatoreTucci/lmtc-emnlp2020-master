The initial budgetary commitment shall be based on an indicative financial plan; this commitment shall be made for one year.\n4. The commitment will be made when the decision approving assistance is adopted by the Standing Committee on Plant Health under procedure 16a of Council Directive 77/93/EEC (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/14/EC (2).\n5. Following commitment a first advance of not more than ECU 300 000 shall be paid.\n6.

In cases of dispute the Commission shall examine the case within the partnership framework, asking Portugal or the other authorities designated by Portugal for implementation of the measure to submit their comments within two months.\n14. The Commission may reduce or suspend aid for a measure if the examination confirms the existence of an irregularity, in particular of a substantial modification affecting the nature or conditions of implementation of the measure for which approval by the Commission has not been sought.\nRecovery of undue payments\n15. All sums unduly paid must be reimbursed to the Community by the designated authority indicated in point 8. Interest may be levied on sums not reimbursed.

Monitoring and assessment\nI. Monitoring Committee\n1.

Monitoring and assessment of the programme during the implementation period (continuous monitoring and assessment)\n1. The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous monitoring and assessment of the programme.\n2.

The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives.\nImplementation report and scrutiny of the programme\n4. Portugal shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final implementation report.\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission before 31 March 1998 and shall thereafter be presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health within six weeks.\n5. The Commission may jointly with Portugal call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or measures, modification of the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken. To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will not pay the entire cost of employing him.\nC. Information and publicity\nIn the framework of this programme, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicized.\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n- make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\nPortugal and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the Monitoring Committee.\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\nII.
