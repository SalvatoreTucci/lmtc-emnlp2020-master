Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, reasoned objections to the placing on the market of the products were raised in accordance with that provision. As a consequence, an additional assessment report was required.\n(4) Article 46(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation) provides that requests submitted pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 before the date of application of the Regulation, i.e. 18 April 2004, shall be transformed into applications pursuant to Chapter II, Section 1 of the Regulation in cases where an additional assessment report is required in accordance with Article 6(3) or (4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(5) The scope of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 is limited to the placing on the market, within the Community, of novel foods or novel food ingredients. Consequently the present decision does not cover the placing on the market of feed containing, consisting of or produced from maize line 1507.\n(6) In particular, the placing on the market of genetically modified maize line 1507 as or in some products including feed containing or consisting of this maize is subject to Commission Decision 2005/772/EC of 3 November 2005 concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a maize product (Zea mays L., line 1507) genetically modified for resistance to certain lepidopteran pests and for tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium\u00a0(3).\n(7) Feed produced from maize line 1507 has been placed on the market before the date of application of the Regulation, i.e. 18 April 2004. As a consequence, it is subject to the requirements provided for in Article 20 of the Regulation and may be placed on the market and used in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Community Register of genetically modified food and feed.\n(8) On 3 March 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (Authority) gave its opinion in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulation that there is no evidence to indicate that the placing on the market of the products is likely to cause adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment\u00a0(4). In giving its opinion, the Authority considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States.\n(9) Accordingly, the Authority advised that no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Article 13(1) of the Regulation are necessary. The Authority also advised that no specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, and no specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) of the Regulation, are required.\n(10) In its opinion, the Authority concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.\n(11) In the light of the above considerations, authorisation should be granted.\n(12) A unique identifier should be assigned to maize line 1507 as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(5).\n(13) All information contained in the Annex to this Decision on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community Register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in the Regulation.\n(14) In accordance with Article 4(2) of the Regulation, the conditions for authorisation of the product bind all persons placing it on the market.\n(15) This Decision should be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Articles 9(1) and to point 2(c) of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms\u00a0(6).\n(16) No opinion was delivered by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 5 October 2005 in accordance with Article 5(4) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC\u00a0(7), the Council being required to act within three months.\n(17) However, the Council has not acted within the required time limit; a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Products\nThis Decision covers foods and food ingredients containing, consisting of, or produced from the genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) line 1507 further specified in the Annex to this Decision (the products) and assigned the unique identifier DAS-\u00d815\u00d87-1, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 65/2004.", "Placing on the market\nThe placing on the market of the products, according to the conditions specified in this Decision and its Annex, is authorised for the purposes of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.", "Labelling\nFor the purposes of the specific labelling requirements provided for in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the \u2018name of the organism\u2019 shall be \u2018maize\u2019.", "Monitoring for environmental effects\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorisation holders shall ensure that the monitoring plan for environmental effects, as specified in the Annex to this Decision, is put in place and implemented.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorisation holders shall submit to the Commission annual reports on the implementation and the results of the monitoring activities.\nThe reports shall clearly state those parts of the reports which are considered to be confidential, together with a verifiable justification for confidentiality in accordance with Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\nConfidential parts of such reports shall be submitted in separate documents.", "Community Register\nThe information in the Annex to this Decision shall be entered in the Community Register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.", "Authorisation holders\nThe authorisation holders are:\n(a) Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Belgium, representing Pioneer Hi-Bred International, United States of America; and\n(b) Dow AgroSciences Europe, United Kingdom, representing Mycogen Seeds, United States of America;\nboth of which are responsible for fulfilling the duties of authorisation holders provided for in this Decision and in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.", "Validity\nThis Decision shall be valid for a period of 10 years from the date of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 March 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.
