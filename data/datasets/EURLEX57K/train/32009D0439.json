By letter dated 20 March 2009, the Commission notified the United Kingdom that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of the request.\n(3) The person liable for the payment of VAT under Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC is the taxable person supplying the goods. However, the derogating measure enabled the United Kingdom to apply, until 30 April 2009 and under certain conditions, a reverse charge mechanism which implied that the liability for the payment of VAT shifted to the taxable person to whom certain supplies of mobile phones and integrated circuit devices were made, provided the taxable amount of the supply was equal to, or higher than, GBP 5\u00a0000.\n(4) The purpose of that derogating measure was to deal with certain aggressive forms of tax evasion, and in particular with \u2018carousel\u2019 schemes whereby goods are supplied several times without VAT being paid to the tax authorities while leaving customers with a valid invoice for VAT deduction. The application of the reverse charge, without actual payment of VAT from the customer to the supplier, removes the possibility of that form of tax evasion.\n(5) Given the apparent seriousness of VAT fraud in the United Kingdom, as attested by the information submitted by the United Kingdom, and given the measure\u2019s expected preventive effect, the measure remains proportionate since the extension of the derogation is limited to a reasonable period and the measure remains targeted in scope. Furthermore, it does not form the basis of an overall measure for a generalised reverse charge system.\n(6) The derogation has no negative impact on the Community\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT.\n(7) Legal continuity of the measure should be ensured,", "main_body": ["Article 4 of Council Decision 2007/250/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 4\nThis Decision shall expire on 30 April 2011.\u2019", "This Decision shall apply from 1 May 2009.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 May 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
