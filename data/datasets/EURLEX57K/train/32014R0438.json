That list includes cyproconazole.\n(2) Cyproconazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type\u00a08, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to\u00a0product-type\u00a08 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Ireland was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 30 May 2012 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated in an assessment report reviewed within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 March 2014.\n(5) According to that assessment report, biocidal products used for product-type 8 and containing cyproconazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve cyproconazole for use in biocidal products for product-type 8 subject to compliance with such specifications and conditions.\n(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) The report concludes that cyproconazole meets the criteria for being classified as toxic for reproduction category\u00a01B in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), and for being very persistent (vP) and toxic (T) according to Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Notwithstanding the fact that the existing harmonised classification of cyproconazole should be revised pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, those intrinsic properties should be taken into account for the purpose of determining the period of approval.\n(9) Since the conditions of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 are not met, the current practice under Directive 98/8/EC should be followed. The period of approval should therefore be five years.\n(10) However, for the purpose of authorising products in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0528/2012, cyproconazole shall be considered as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 10(1)(a) and (d) of that Regulation.\n(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements laid down.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Cyproconazole shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 8, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0167, 27.6.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a03).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L\u00a0353, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nCommon name IUPAC name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nCyproconazole IUPAC Name: 940 g/kg 1 November 2015 31 October 2020 8 Cyproconazole is considered a candidate for\u00a0substitution in accordance with Article\u00a010(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0528/2012.\n(1) For industrial users, safe operational procedures and appropriate organizational measures shall be established.
