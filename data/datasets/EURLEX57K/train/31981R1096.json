Each subsidy awarded and therefore each report relates to a project which concerns one or more investments (each investment being defined by its location), and of which the financial burden is borne by one or more beneficiaries.\nForm B 5 concerns the project.\nB 3, B 4 and B 6 concern the investments.\nIf there are several investments (several locations) each form should be completed for each location.\nB 1 and B 2 concern the beneficiary. If there are several beneficiaries, one of each of these forms should be submitted for each beneficiary.\n2. Forms B 1 to B 6 of the report correspond to forms B 1 to B 5 and B 10 which the beneficiary submitted with its original application for aid. In principle, they should be completed in a similar way. The principal difference is that, for the new forms B 3 to B 6, for the years after the completion of the project, the figures will represent actual results and not estimates as when the application was submitted. Obviously, these results will not always match the estimates. This has no significance for the subsidy which has been paid ; however, an explanation of the reasons is desirable.\n3.
