Commission ECR I, p. 2987, the withdrawal of an unlawful act is admissible only if it takes place within a reasonable period and sufficient account is taken of the legitimate expectations engendered by its adoption; whereas the application of these principles requires that the rights engendered among its intended beneficiaries, and in particular those involved in the textiles trade (by Regulation (EC) No 3053/95) in the period from 1 January 1995 and the date of entry into force of this Regulation be honoured; whereas it must nevertheless be underlined that this withdrawal is not to be seen as undermining or derogating from Article 20 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, which provides that the said Regulation and its Annexes 'shall not constitute in any way a derogation from the provisions either of the bilateral agreements, protocols or arrangements on textile trade which the Community has concluded with the third countries listed in Annex II or of the ATC with regard to the WTO Members listed in Annex XI and which, in all cases of conflict, shall prevail`;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
