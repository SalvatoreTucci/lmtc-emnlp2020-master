In view of the disparities between Member States and the consequent risk of distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary in order to ensure market unity whilst abiding by the principle of proportionality.\n(5) The Scientific Committee on Food concluded in its opinion of 12 December 2001 that levels of inorganic tin of 150 mg/kg in canned beverages and 250 mg/kg in other canned foods may cause gastric irritation in some individuals. Information is not available to indicate whether or not infants and young children might be at greater risk.\n(6) To protect public health from this acute health risk it is necessary to set maximum levels for inorganic tin in canned foods and canned beverages. Until data becomes available on the sensitivity of infants and young children to inorganic tin in foods, it is necessary on a precautionary basis to protect the health of this vulnerable population group. Lower maximum levels are necessary, which are achievable through the strictly controlled manufacturing and packaging of infant formulae, follow-on formulae, baby foods and processed cereal-based foods for infants and young children.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "The Commission shall review the maximum levels for inorganic tin as set in points 1 and 2 of the Annex to this Regulation by 1 January 2006 taking into account the progress in scientific and technological knowledge.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 February 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 77, 16.3.2001, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 326, 13.12.2003, p. 12.\n(4) OJ L 175, 4.7.1991, p. 35.\n(5) OJ L 41, 14.2.2003, p. 37.\n(6) OJ L 49, 28.2.1996, p. 17.\n(7) OJ L 41, 14.2.2003, p. 33.\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 the following Section 6 is added:\n\"Section 6: Tin (inorganic)\n>TABLE>\""}
