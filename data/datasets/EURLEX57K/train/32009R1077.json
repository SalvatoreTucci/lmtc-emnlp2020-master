The aid is granted due to the exceptional circumstances the pigmeat sector in Ireland and Northern Ireland experienced in December 2008 when findings revealed elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in pigmeat originating in Ireland. The situation has changed since then and consequently the measures are no longer needed.\n(2) The granting of private storage aid for pigmeat should therefore be ended and a closing date for the submission of applications should be set.\n(3) In order to avoid speculation the Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication and the closing date should be the day following the entry into force.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The closing date for the submission of applications for private storage aid for pigmeat provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1329/2008 shall be 13 November 2009.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 345, 23.12.2008, p. 56."}
