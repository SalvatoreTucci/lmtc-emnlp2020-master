One of the aims of that Regulation is to ensure uniformity of the rules applicable to trade and non-commercial movements of animals and to avoid fraud.\n(3) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 amended Directive 92/65/EEC so that that Directive provides that to be the subject of trade, dogs, cats and ferrets are to satisfy the requirements set out in that Regulation.\n(4) Accordingly, it is appropriate to adopt for the importation into the Community for trade of dogs, cats and ferrets rules corresponding to those for the non-commercial importation of those animals while maintaining the clinical examination required by Article 16 of Directive 92/65/EEC.\n(5) It is appropriate to ensure that the rules and principles applied by third country certifying officers provide sufficient guarantees.
