The general government net borrowing in Finland declined in 1994 and 1995, and further in 1996, when it reached 2,6 % of GDP, a level below the Treaty reference value. General government net borrowing is expected to decline to 1,9 % of GDP in 1997. The updated Finnish convergence programme aims at a general government surplus in 1999.\nThe increasing trend in the government gross debt ratio has been brought to an end after 1994; the debt ratio declined in 1995 and 1996, when it was 58,7 % of GDP. The debt ratio has never exceeded the Treaty reference value of 60 % of GDP.\nThe deficit was below the Treaty reference value in 1996 and is expected to remain so in 1997 and to decline further, turning into a surplus in the medium term; the gross debt ratio is below the Treaty reference value and is expected to remain so in the foreseeable future,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Finland has been corrected.", "The Council Decision of 10 July 1995 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Finland is hereby abrogated.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Finland."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 30 June 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
