Those rates should therefore be defined on the same terms as for the other Member States.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 411/88 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Fund Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 411/88 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
