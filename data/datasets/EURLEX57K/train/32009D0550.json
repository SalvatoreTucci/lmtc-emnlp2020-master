In accordance with Article 19(3) of the Convention, an amendment will take effect 120 days following the date of notification by the Depositary of receipt of written notification of approval by three-fourths of all Contracting Parties.\n(4) The Contracting Parties to the Convention adopted an amendment to the Convention at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in November 2004 allowing NEAFC to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention.\n(5) By postal vote on 11 August 2006 the Contracting Parties to the Convention adopted an amendment to the Convention whereby the scope of the Convention was extended so as to include sedentary species and the objectives of the Convention were broadened. The Convention was also amended so as to mention developments in other international forums for fisheries management that affect fisheries in the NEAFC Convention area, and certain new definitions were introduced.\n(6) Sedentary species are harvested or affected by fisheries and it is therefore appropriate to include those species in the scope of the Convention.\n(7) The Convention provides that NEAFC shall perform its functions in the interest of the conservation and optimum utilisation of fishery resources. In addition to these objectives, it is important to underline the importance of long-term management and that the management of fishery resources should provide sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits. It is therefore appropriate to include these elements as objectives in the Convention.\n(8) According to the Convention, NEAFC shall, in performing its functions, take account of the best scientific evidence available to it. In fulfilling the objectives, it is also important to take into account the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach and the need to conserve marine biological diversity. It is therefore appropriate that NEAFC also take these elements into account in performing its functions.\n(9) A dispute settlement procedure established under the Convention should enable the expeditious settlement of disputes, which would be in the interest of the Community.\n(10) Furthermore, such a procedure would help towards the strengthening and modernisation of regional fisheries management organisations, in particular the NEAFC, and thereby ensure the long-term sustainability of the fisheries in the North-East Atlantic.\n(11) In the light of the fishing possibilities accruing to the Community under the Convention, it is therefore in the Community\u2019s interest to approve the proposed amendments,", "main_body": ["The amendments to the Convention are hereby approved on behalf of the European Community.\nThe text of the amendments to the Convention are attached to this Decision.", "The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to notify the Depositary Government of the Community\u2019s approval in accordance with Article 19(3) of the Convention\u00a0(3)."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM. \u0158\u00cdMAN\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Opinion of 19 February 2009 (not yet published in the Official Journal).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 227, 12.8.1981, p. 21.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The date of entry into force of the amendments will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by the General Secretariat of the Council.\nANNEX\nThe Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
