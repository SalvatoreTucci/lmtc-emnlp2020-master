It answers the call made in Declaration No 16 relating to Article 225a of the EC Treaty\u00a0(1), adopted when the Treaty of Nice was signed on 26 February 2001.\n(3) A judicial panel should accordingly be attached to the Court of First Instance, that shall for institutional and organisational purposes be an integral part of the Court of Justice institution, an institution with members enjoying a similar status to members of the Court of First Instance.\n(4) The new judicial panel should be given a name that distinguishes it in its trial formations from the trial formations of the Court of First Instance.\n(5) To make the court system generally easy to understand, the provisions relating to the judicial panel's jurisdiction, composition, organisation and procedure should be laid down in an Annex to the Statute of the Court of Justice.\n(6) The number of judges of the judicial panel should match its caseload. To facilitate decision-making by the Council in the appointment of judges, provision should be made for the Council to establish an independent Advisory Committee to verify that applications received meet the relevant conditions.\n(7) The judicial panel should try cases by a procedure matching the specific features of the disputes that are to be referred to it, examining the possibilities for amicable settlement of disputes at all stages of the procedure.\n(8) In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 225a of the EC Treaty and the third paragraph of Article 140b of the Euratom Treaty, appeals may be lodged at the Court of First Instance against decisions of the judicial panel on points of law only in the same conditions as those governing appeals lodged at the Court of Justice against decisions of the Court of First Instance. The relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court of Justice are reproduced in the Annex to the Statute relating to the judicial panel, to avoid cross-references that would make the general set of provisions difficult to read.\n(9) Provision should be made in this Decision for transitional arrangements so that the judicial panel can exercise its functions as soon as it is established,", "main_body": ["A judicial panel shall be attached to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities to hear disputes involving the European Union civil service and shall be known as the \u2018European Union Civil Service Tribunal\u2019.
