whereas these standards, especially in the case of margarine, may in particular relate to quality classification, taking account of marketing requirements and the special position of these products;\nWhereas the development of production techniques and the expectations of consumers have resulted in increasing diversification of the market in solid fats intended for human consumption;\nWhereas the products covered by this Regulation must be deemed to be competing products, being comparable from the point of view of certain characteristics, in particular appearance and use;\nWhereas the laying down of marketing standards for the milk and non-milk products concerned with a clear and distinct classification accompanied by rules on designation will accordingly ensure the stability of the agricultural markets in question and  contribute to the establishment of a fair standard of living for the agricultural population;\nWhereas the main aspect of the products is their fat content; whereas the products with a fat content of at least 10 % but less than 90 % by weight intended for human consumption make up the great majority of products on the market, and in particular of  products intended for the ultimate consumer;\nWhereas a solution laying down a uniform classification for all the products involved will make it easier for the consumer to choose between products which, on the one hand, are comparable as regards fat content in general but, on the other hand, differ  as regards the plant and/or animal fats used;\nWhereas the scope of the Regulation must be extended to all competing products with a fat content of at least 10 % but less than 90 % by total weight intended for supply without further processing to the ultimate consumer;\nWhereas the possibility of manufacturing products with various fat contents should be maintained and, in order to avoid confusing the consumer, and in view of experience gained in the milk sector, the terms 'butter' and 'margarine' should be used solely  for certain categories of products with a clearly defined fat content;\nWhereas, moreover, such a framework of Community rules will contribute towards the development of trade under conditions of fair competition;\nWhereas, in order to achieve the desired clarity, designations for all the products concerned should be laid down; whereas the reduction in the fat content must appear in the designation;\nWhereas, as a result, provision should be made that only those products meeting the requirements of this Regulation may be supplied for final consumption; whereas products which fall outside the scope of this Regulation may be supplied or transferred to  the ultimate consumer, but the reserved sales descriptions may not be used;\nWhereas this Regulation must apply without prejudice to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (6), as is also the case with regard to Community legislation in  the veterinary and foodstuffs sectors aimed at ensuring compliance with hygiene and labelling standards for foodstuffs;\nWhereas it is necessary to adopt certain provisions additional to those laid down in Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of  foodstuffs (7); whereas this involves, in particular, the indication of the total fat content and certain fat constituents composed of various plant and animal fats;\nWhereas, in order to ensure the coherence of these arrangements, products imported from third countries should be subject to equivalent requirements;\nWhereas provision should be made for the Member States to lay down suitable checks and penalties in the case of infringements of this Regulation;\nWhereas the standards laid down in this Regulation are entirely without prejudice to the tariff classification of the products in question;\nWhereas a sufficient time limit should be provided for in order, on the one hand, to allow all products on the market to be adapted to the provisions laid down and, on the other hand, to allow stocks of packaging labelled in accordance with national  legislation previously in force to be disposed of,", "main_body": ["1. This Regulation lays down standards for:\n(a) milk fats falling within CN codes 0405 and ex 2106;\n(b) fats falling within CN code ex 1517; and\n(c) fats composed of plant and/or animal products falling within CN codes ex 1517 and ex 2106;\nwith a fat content of at least 10 % but less than 90 % by weight, intended for human consumption.\nThe fat content excluding salt must be at least two-thirds of the dry matter.\n2.

The sales description referred to in paragraph 1 (a) may be used together with one or more terms to define the plant and/or animal species from which the products originate, or the intended use of the products as well as with other terms concerning  the production methods in so far as such terms are not in contradiction with other Community provisions, in particular with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and  foodstuffs (8). Indications of geographical origin may also be used subject to the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and  foodstuffs (9).\n4. The term 'vegetable' may be used together with the sales descriptions in the Annex, Part B, provided that the product contains only fat of vegetable origin with a tolerance of 2 % of the fat content for animal fats. This tolerance shall also apply  where reference is made to a vegetable species.\n5.

Terms for products referred to in the Annex which state, imply or suggest fat content other than those referred to in that Annex shall be prohibited.\n2.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and for a transitional period of five years after the publication of this Regulation the terms referred to in paragraph 1 may continue to appear on products which already display them on 31 December 1993 and  which are legally marketed on the market of a Member State.", "1. Subject to the provisions of this Regulation, Member States may adopt or maintain national regulations laying down different quality levels. Such regulations must allow those quality levels to be assessed on the basis of criteria relating  in particular to the raw materials used, the organoleptic, characteristics of the products and their physical and microbiological stability.\nMember States making use of this option shall ensure that other Member States' products which comply with the criteria laid down by those regulations may, under non-discriminatory conditions, use terms which, by virtue of those regulations, state that  those criteria are complied with.\n2. The sales descriptions referred to in Article 3 (1) (a) may be supplemented by a reference to the quality level peculiar to the product concerned.\n3. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that checks are conducted on the application of all the criteria referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 for determining the quality levels. Regular and frequent checks shall  extend up to the end product and must be made by one or more bodies governed by public law and designated by the Member State, or by an approved body supervised by the latter.
