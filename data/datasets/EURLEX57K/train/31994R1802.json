products falling within category 28 were submitted to a provisional quantitative limit for the period 25 March to 24 June 1994 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1134/94 (3);\nWhereas the Community and Pakistan were unable during the consultations held to reach a satisfactory solution within the time limits foreseen in the Agreement on trade in textile products between the Community and Pakistan and the provisional  quantitative limit established by Regulation (EC) No 1134/94 expires on 24 June 1994;\nWhereas it is appropriate pending the outcome of further consultations to introduce at this

the quantitative limit introduced provisionally;\nWhereas the provisions of the Agreement on trade in textile products between the Community and Pakistan, which concern exports of products subject to the quantitative limits established in Annex II to the Agreement and in particular those relating to  the double checking system are applicable to products for which quantitative limits are introduced

products falling within category 28 exported from Pakistan on or after 25 March 1994 must be set off against the quantitative limit fixed for the period 25 March to 31 December 1994;\nWhereas the quantitative limit for imports of products falling within category 28 should not prevent the importation of products covered by it shipped from Pakistan before the entry into force of Regulation (EC)
