Those conditions concern the implementation of a stamping out policy to control the disease, including adequate cleansing and disinfection carried out on all previously infected establishments. In addition, avian influenza surveillance must have been carried out in accordance with Part II of Annex IV to that Regulation during a three-month period following completion of the stamping out policy and cleansing and disinfection.\n(3) Israel is listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as a third country from which all poultry commodities covered by that Regulation may be imported into the Union. Following a HPAI outbreak in early 2010 imports of certain commodities from Israel to the Union were restricted to defined parts of its territory by that Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 332/2010\u00a0(4). The area from which imports of certain commodities were prohibited is described in column 3 with the code IL-2 in the entry for Israel in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 and applied until 1 May 2010. However, the prohibition of imports of certain poultry commodities from IL-2 in relation to that outbreak should continue for commodities produced before that date.\n(4) In addition, on 8 March 2011 Israel has notified the Commission of an outbreak of HPAI of the H5N1 subtype on its territory.\n(5) Due to the confirmed outbreak of HPAI, the territory of Israel may no longer be considered as free from that disease. As a consequence, the veterinary authorities of Israel have suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of certain poultry commodities accordingly.\n(6) Israel has submitted information to the Commission on the control measures taken in relation to the recent outbreak of the disease. That information and the epidemiological situation in Israel have been evaluated by the Commission.\n(7) Israel has implemented a stamping out policy in order to control the disease and limit its spread. The prompt and decisive action taken by Israel to confine the disease and the positive outcome of the evaluation of the epidemiological situation allow limiting the restrictions on imports into the Union for certain poultry commodities to the zone affected by the disease, which the veterinary authorities of Israel have placed under restrictions.\n(8) In addition, Israel is carrying out surveillance activities for avian influenza which appear to meet the requirements laid down in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.\n(9) Taking into account the favourable development of the epidemiological situation and the surveillance activities for avian influenza in resolving the outbreak in accordance with the conditions set out in Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, it is appropriate to limit the time period during which the authorisation for imports into the Union is suspended to a three-month period until 14 June 2011 following adequate cleansing and disinfection of the previously infected holding.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for Israel is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 74.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 226, 23.8.2008, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 102, 23.4.2010, p. 10.\nANNEX\n\u2018IL \u2014 Israel IL-0 Whole country SPF\nEP, E       S4\nIL-1 Area of Israel excluding IL-2 and IL-3 BPR, BPP, DOC, DOR, HEP, HER, SRP  N   A  S5, ST1\nWGM VIII\nPOU, RAT  N\nIL-2 Area of Israel inside the following boundaries:\n\u2014 to the west: road number 4,\n\u2014 to the south: road number 5812 connecting to road number 5815,\n\u2014 to the east: the security fence until road number 6513,\n\u2014 to the north: road number 6513 until the junction with road 65.
