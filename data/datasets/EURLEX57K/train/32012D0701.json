Article 9 of that Directive lays down criteria for the approval of compulsory national control programmes for certain contagious diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease. In addition, Article 10 of that Directive provides that where a Member State considers its territory or part thereof to be free of such diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission.\n(2) Commission Decision 2008/185/EC of 21 February 2008 on additional guarantees in intra-Community trade of pigs relating to Aujeszky\u2019s disease and criteria to provide information on this disease\u00a0(2) lays down the additional guarantees for movements of pigs between Member States. Those guarantees are linked to the classification of Member States according to their Aujeszky\u2019s disease status.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC lists Member States or regions thereof which are free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited. Annex II to that Decision lists Member States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky\u2019s disease are in place.\n(4) Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Italian province of Bolzano are currently listed in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC, as a Member State or region thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky\u2019s disease have been implemented.\n(5) Ireland, the United Kingdom as regards Northern Ireland and Italy as regards the province of Bolzano have now submitted documentation in support of their application to declare those Member States and the province of Bolzano free from Aujeszky\u2019s disease.\n(6) Following the evaluation of the supporting documentation submitted by Ireland, by the United Kingdom and by Italy, it is appropriate that Ireland, Northern Ireland and the province of Bolzano are no longer listed in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC, but instead be listed in Annex I thereto.\n(7) Decision 2008/185/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2008/185/EC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nMaro\u0161 \u0160EF\u010cOVI\u010c\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 1977/64.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 59, 4.3.2008, p. 19.\nANNEX\nANNEX I\nMember States or regions thereof free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited\nISO code Member State Regions\nBE Belgium All regions\nCZ Czech Republic All regions\nDK Denmark All regions\nDE Germany All regions\nIE Ireland All regions\nFR France The departments of Ain, Aisne, Allier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, Ard\u00e8che, Ardennes, Ari\u00e8ge, Aube, Aude, Aveyron, Bas-Rhin, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Calvados, Cantal, Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cher, Corr\u00e8ze, C\u00f4te-d\u2019Or, C\u00f4tes-d\u2019Armor, Creuse, Deux-S\u00e8vres, Dordogne, Doubs, Dr\u00f4me, Essonne, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Finist\u00e8re, Gard, Gers, Gironde, Hautes-Alpes, Hauts-de-Seine, Haute Garonne, Haute-Loire, Haute-Marne, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Haut-Rhin, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, Haute-Savoie, Haute-Vienne, H\u00e9rault, Indre, Ille-et-Vilaine, Indre-et-Loire, Is\u00e8re, Jura, Landes, Loire, Loire-Atlantique, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Loz\u00e8re, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Marne, Mayenne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Morbihan, Moselle, Ni\u00e8vre, Nord, Oise, Orne, Paris, Pas-de-Calais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, R\u00e9union, Rh\u00f4ne, Sarthe, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Savoie, Seine-et-Marne, Seine-Maritime, Seine-Saint-Denis, Somme, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne, Territoire de Belfort, Val-de-Marne, Val-d\u2019Oise, Var, Vaucluse, Vend\u00e9e, Vienne, Vosges, Yonne, Yvelines\nIT Italy The province of Bolzano\nCY Cyprus All regions\nLU Luxembourg All regions\nNL Netherlands All regions\nAT Austria All regions\nSI Slovenia All regions\nSK Slovakia All regions\nFI Finland All regions\nSE Sweden All regions\nUK United Kingdom All regions\nANNEX II\nMember States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky\u2019s disease are in place\nISO code Member State Regions\nES Spain All regions\nHU Hungary All regions\nPL Poland All regions"}
