This corresponds to 890700 tonnes for Spain, 521000 tonnes for Greece, 428800 tonnes for Italy, 33300 tonnes for Portugal and 2400 tonnes for France. The amount withheld from production aid for this olive-oil marketing year serves as a basis for financing measures to improve the quality of oil during the production cycle commencing on 1 May 2000.\n(3) The measures have relatively fixed minimum costs. The ceilings on total financing for some Member States may therefore prove to be too low. Appropriate limits should consequently be established for those cases.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["For the production cycle from 1 May 2000 to 30 April 2001, the ceilings on financing for the measures laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 528/1999 shall be:\n>TABLE>", "Notwithstanding Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 528/1999, the additional national financial contribution from Member States whose ceiling on financing laid down in Article 1 is EUR 100000 or less shall be no more than EUR 250000.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 March 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.\n(2) OJ L 327, 21.12.1999, p. 7.\n(3) OJ L 62, 11.3.1999, p. 8.\n(4) OJ L 267, 15.10.1999, p. 19."}
