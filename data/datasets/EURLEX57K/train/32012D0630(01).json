The aim is to secure the highest standard of competence, a broad range of relevant expertise, for instance in management and in public administration, and the broadest possible geographic distribution within the Union.\n(4) In examining the list submitted by the Commission, the Council has taken account of the fact that the Commission is to proceed without delay to replace a member who recently resigned from the EFSA Management Board by way of a separate procedure and is to submit a list of candidates to that effect in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(5) The Council has also taken account of the fact that one of the current EFSA Management Board members whose mandate is to expire on 30 June 2014 may, due to a change in his professional activities, be regarded as a member with a background in organisations representing other interests in the food chain.\n(6) The Decision of 24 June 2010 appointing half of the members of the Management Board of the European Food Safety Authority\u00a0(2) should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The following persons shall be appointed as members of the Management Board of the European Food Safety Authority for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2016:\nVal\u00e9rie BADUEL\nSue DAVIES\u00a0(3)\n\u00a0(4)\nPiergiuseppe FACELLI\u00a0(4)\nJaana HUSU-KALLIO\nRadu ROATI\u0218 CHE\u021aAN\nJi\u0159\u00ed RUPRICH\u00a0(4)\nTadeusz WIJASZKA", "In Article 1 of the Decision of 24 June 2010, the following sign \u2018(**)\u2019 shall be added to the name \u2018Jan MOUSING\u2019.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 18 June 2012.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
