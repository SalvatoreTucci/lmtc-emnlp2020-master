The total assistance from the Structural Funds granted under the single programming document amounts to EUR 183519000 for the ERDF. Of that amount, the grant of EUR 28777000, which exceeds the financial perspective currently in force, shall be suspended until that perspective has been adjusted by the two arms of the budgetary authority. In so far as the amount of the suspended grant actually corresponds, year by year, to the budget appropriations that will become available following that adjustment, the suspension shall be lifted without further formality on the entry into force of that adjustment and the grant shall then become effective.\nThe suspended amount referred to in the first paragraph shall be allocated by year as follows: EUR 6046900 in 2002, EUR 6046900 in 2003, EUR 6046800 in 2004, EUR 6046800 in 2005 and EUR 4589600 in 2006.\n2.

In the absence of such exemption or approval, aid is illegal and subject to the consequences set out in the procedural regulation for State aid, and its part-financing would be treated as an irregularity within the meaning of Articles 38 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.\nConsequently, the Commission will not accept requests for interim and final payments under Article 32 of the Regulation for measures being part-financed with new or altered aid, as defined in the procedural regulation for State aid, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, until such aid has been notified to and formally approved by the Commission.", "The date from which expenditure shall be eligible is 1 January 2000.
