In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.\n(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2005 (1 October 2004-30 September 2005). On the basis of the data published by the United States\u2019 Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 36,91 million.\n(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has increased, the first eight products of the list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be added to the list in Annex I to that Regulation.\n(4) The effect of a 15\u00a0% ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 36,91 million.\n(5) Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 contain specific exemptions from the additional import duty. Since the applicability of those exemptions is dependent on certain conditions being met before the entry into force or on the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005, the exemptions cannot in practice apply for imports of the eight products now added to the list in Annex I. Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products.\n(6) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on trade retaliation,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Products classified under the CN codes 6301\u00a040\u00a010, 6301\u00a030\u00a010, 6301\u00a030\u00a090, 6301\u00a040\u00a090, 4818\u00a050\u00a000, 9009\u00a011\u00a000, 9009\u00a012\u00a000 and 8467\u00a021\u00a099 for which an import licence with an exemption from, or a reduction of duty, was issued before the date of entry into force of this Regulation shall not be subject to the additional duty.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Products classified under the CN codes 6301\u00a040\u00a010, 6301\u00a030\u00a010, 6301\u00a030\u00a090, 6301\u00a040\u00a090, 4818\u00a050\u00a000, 9009\u00a011\u00a000, 9009\u00a012\u00a000 and 8467\u00a021\u00a099 for which it can be demonstrated that they are already en route to the Community on the date of application of this Regulation, and whose destination cannot be changed, shall not be subject to the additional duty.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 April 2006.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 110, 30.4.2005, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe products on which additional duties are to apply are identified by their eight-digit CN codes.
