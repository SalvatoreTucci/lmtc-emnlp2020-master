The Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the products listed in the Annex shall be suspended in full from 1 July 1991 to 31 December 1995.\n2.  The suspension referred to in paragraph 1 shall apply solely to products intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market.\n3.  The relevant Spanish authorities shall adopt the provisions necessary to ensure compliance with paragraph 2 pursuant to the relevant Community provisions on end-use and in particular the levying of Common Customs Tariff duties when the products in  question are dispatched to the other parts of the customs territory of the Community.\nThey shall inform the Commission of such measures at the earliest opportunity.", "1.  In the case of the products referred to in Article 1, the relevant Spanish authorities shall inform the Commission, no later than the fifteenth of each month, beginning on 15 September 1992, of the volume of imports exempted from duty  during the preceding month.\n2.  The information to be sent on 15 September 1992 must cover all imports since 1 July 1991.", "In the framework of the interim period provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91, the Commission, after consulting the competent Spanish authorities, shall examine in 1995 the effect of all the measures adopted in favour of the  economy of the Canary Islands. On the basis of the outcome of this examination, it shall submit to the Council the requisite proposals for the period extending beyond 31 December 1995.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 1991.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 15 June 1992.\nFor the CouncilThe PresidentJoao PINHEIRO\n(1) OJ No C 100, 22. 4. 1992, p. 14.\n(2) Opinion delivered on 9 June 1992 (not yet published in the Official Journal).\n(3) OJ No L 171, 29. 6. 1991, p. 1.
