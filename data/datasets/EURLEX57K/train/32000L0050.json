France acting as nominated rapporteur Member State, submitted to the Commission on 9 June 1998 the draft assessment report concerned.\n(5) The submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 16 June 2000 in the format of the Commission review report for prohexadione-calcium. It may be necessary to update this report to take account of technical and scientific developments. In such case the conditions for the inclusion of prohexadione-calcium in Annex I to the Directive will also need to be amended pursuant to Article 6(1) of that Directive.\n(6) The dossier and the information from the review were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants for opinion on 26 November 1999. This Committee gave its opinion on 6 June 2000.\n(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a), (b) and (3) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the said Directive.\n(8) After inclusion, a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of the Directive on plant protection products containing prohexadione-calcium and in particular to review, within this period, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. A longer period may also be required for plant protection products containing prohexadione-calcium and other active substances included in Annex I.\n(9) It is appropriate to provide that the finalised review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.\n(10) The review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive, where these principles refer to the evaluation of the Annex II data which were submitted for the purpose of the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to the Directive.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health delivered on 16 June 2000,", "main_body": ["Prohexadione-calcium is hereby designated as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, as set out in the Annex hereto.", "1.

However, with regard to evaluation and decision-making pursuant to the uniform principles provided for in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III thereto, the period laid down in the first paragraph is extended for existing provisional authorisations of plant protection products containing prohexadione-calcium to 1 January 2002.\n3. However for plant protection products containing prohexadione-calcium together with another active substance which is in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the period referred to in paragraph 1 is extended to the extent that a longer implementation period is provided for by the provisions laid down in the Directive concerning the inclusion of this other active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n4. Member States shall keep available the review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) for consultation by any interested parties or shall make it available to them on specific request.\n5. When Member States adopt the measures, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication.
