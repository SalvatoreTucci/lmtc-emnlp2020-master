A Community financial contribution should therefore be granted for the hosting, management and maintenance of the integrated computerised veterinary system TRACES (Trade Control and Expert System), introduced by Commission Decision 2003/24/EC of 30 December 2002 concerning the development of an integrated computerised veterinary system\u00a0(2), in order to ensure that the system is available, secure and updated.\n(3) Article 37(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC provides that the introduction of systems for identifying animals and notifying diseases under legislation concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade in live animals, with a view to the completion of the internal market, may receive Community financial assistance. A Community financial contribution should therefore be granted in order to update the animal disease notification system (ADNS), based on Commission Decision 2005/176/EC of 1 March 2005 laying down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Council Directive 82/894/EEC\u00a0(3), with the necessary technical improvements.\n(4) The Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a new Animal Health Strategy for the European Union (2007-2013) where \u2018Prevention is better than cure\u2019\u00a0(4) (\u2018the Communication on a new animal health strategy\u2019) provides that the Commission is committed to improve communication towards consumers and stakeholders.\n(5) Article 16 of Decision 90/424/EEC provides that the Community is to make a financial contribution to the establishment of an information policy in the field of animal health, animal welfare and food safety in products of animal origin. A Community financial contribution should therefore be granted for the implementation of measures aimed at improving communication towards consumers and stakeholders in the field of animal health and animal welfare in the framework of the Communication on a new animal health strategy.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 19 of Decision 90/424/EEC, the Community may undertake, or assist the Member States or international organisations in undertaking, the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.\n(7) The gradual introduction of electronic identification for ruminants is one of the expected outcomes of the strategy. As a consequence, a study addressing cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness issues related to the electronic identification of cattle is necessary before introducing new legislation in this field. In order to improve the role of the Community reference laboratories an evaluation of their functioning and performance is deemed necessary. The outcome of these studies and evaluations will be the basis for legislative review in this fields if deemed necessary. A Community financial contribution should therefore be granted to fund studies and evaluations in the areas of food safety, animal health and welfare and zootechnics. The maximum amount to be allocated to those actions should be specified. Calls for tender are to be launched in 2008 for carrying out, under specific contracts, studies and evaluations in the areas of food safety, animal health and welfare and zootechnics.
