Following the report of an outbreak of African swine fever in the Leningrad region of Russia, bordering Estonia and Finland, Commission Decision 2011/78/EU of 3 February 2011 on certain measures to prevent the trasmission of the African swine fever virus from Russia to the Union\u00a0(2) was adopted, laying down provisions to prevent the introduction of that disease into the Union.\n(3) In accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC\u00a0(3) and Article 3 of Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption\u00a0(4), imports of pigs and pig meat products from third countries or parts of the territory of third countries where the presence of African swine fever is confirmed is not authorised.\n(4) The measures laid down in Decision 2011/78/EU ensure that vehicles which have transported pigs and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected. Those measures take into account the risk of spread of the disease considering transmission paths and virus survival in the environment.\n(5) In June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of African swine fever in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, close to the border with Lithuania and Poland. Considering the vicinity of that region with the Union, there is a high risk of introduction of African swine fever into the Union territory. The measures laid down in Decision 2011/78/EU should therefore also apply with regard to vehicles which enter the Union from Belarus.\n(6) In particular, it is appropriate to ensure that all vehicles which have transported live animals and feed and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected, and that such cleansing and disinfection is properly documented.\n(7) The transporter should ensure that for each vehicle used for the transport of animals or feed a register containing information on cleansing and disinfection is retained for a minimum period of three years.\n(8) In the interest of clarity and simplification of Union legislation, Decision 2011/78/EU should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision, \u2018livestock vehicle\u2019 means any vehicle which has been used for the transport of live animals or for the transport of feed to animal holdings.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the operator or driver of a livestock vehicle on arrival from the third countries or from the parts of the territory of third countries listed in Annex I provides to the competent authority of the Member State at the point of entry in the Union information showing that the livestock or loading compartment, where applicable the truck body, the loading ramp, the equipment having been in contact with animals, the wheels and the driver\u2019s cabin and protective clothes/boots used during unloading have been cleansed and disinfected after the last unloading of animals or feed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be included in a declaration completed in accordance with the model set out in Annex II or in any other equivalent format which includes at least the information set out in that model.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original of the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the competent authority for a period of three years.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority of the Member State of the point of entry into the Union shall check livestock vehicles entering the Union from the third countries or from the parts of the territory of third countries listed in Annex I, in order to determine whether they have been satisfactorily cleansed and disinfected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the checks referred to in paragraph 1 show that cleansing and disinfection have been satisfactorily carried out or where the competent authorities have in addition to the measures provided for in paragraph 1 ordered, organised and carried out additional disinfection of previously cleansed livestock vehicles used for the transport of animals, the competent authority shall attest that fact by issuing a certificate in accordance with the model set out in Annex III.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the checks referred to in paragraph 1 show that cleansing and disinfection of the livestock vehicle have not been satisfactorily carried out, the competent authority shall take one of the following measures:\n(a) subject the livestock vehicle to proper cleansing and disinfection at a place designated by the competent authority, as close as possible to the point of entry into the Member State concerned and issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 2;\n(b) where there is no suitable facility for the cleansing and disinfection in the vicinity of the point of entry or there is a risk that residual animal products escape from the uncleaned livestock vehicle, refuse the entry into the Union of the livestock vehicle not satisfactorily cleansed and disinfected.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original of the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the operator or driver of the livestock vehicle for a period of three years.
