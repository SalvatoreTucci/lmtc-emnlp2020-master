By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011\u00a0(4) the Commission granted Cape Verde a new derogation from those rules of origin. The latest derogation expires on 31 December 2014.\n(2) By letter dated 4 June 2014, Cape Verde submitted a request for a prolongation of that derogation for an indefinite period of time from 1 January 2015 until either the expiry of the Protocol (to be published) between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the two parties currently in force, or the application date for the rules of origin under a future Economic Partnership Agreement between the Union and the Economic Community of West African States, whichever occurs later. The request concerns an annual volume of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel fillets.\n(3) From 2008, the total annual quantities that were granted to Cape Verde under the derogation have contributed, to a significant extent, to improving the situation in the Cape Verdean fishery processing sector. Those quantities also led, to a certain extent, to the revitalisation of Cape Verde's artisanal fleet, which is of vital importance for the country. However, fully revitalising the Cape Verdean fleet to the degree envisaged requires that Cape Verde's fish processing industries continue to be provided with enough originating raw materials.\n(4) The request demonstrates that, without the derogation, the ability of the Cape Verdean fish processing industry to continue exporting to the Union would be significantly affected, which might deter further development of the Cape Verdean fleet for small pelagic fishing.\n(5) Additional time is needed to consolidate the results already obtained by Cape Verde in its efforts to revitalise its local fishing fleet. The derogation should give Cape Verde sufficient time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin.\n(6) Having regard to the temporary nature of derogations granted in respect of the definition of the concept of originating products,, it is not possible to grant the derogation for an indefinite period as requested by Cape Verde. Instead, the derogation should be granted for a period of two years, in respect of yearly quantities of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel fillets, to allow Cape Verde to achieve compliance with the rules.\n(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) the Annex is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0302, 19.10.1992, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0253, 11.10.1993, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 815/2008 of 14 August 2008 on a derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 in respect of the definition of the concept of originating products used for the purposes of the scheme of generalised preferences to take account of the special situation of Cape Verde regarding exports of certain fisheries products to the Community (OJ L\u00a0220, 15.8.2008, p.\u00a011).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011 of 6 May 2011 on a derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 in respect of the definition of the concept of originating products used for the purposes of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences to take account of the special situation of Cape Verde regarding exports of certain fisheries products to the European Union (OJ L\u00a0119, 7.5.2011, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nOrder No CN code  Description of goods Periods Quantity (in tonnes net weight)\n09.1647 1604\u00a015\u00a011  Prepared or preserved fillets of mackerel (Scomber scombrus, Scomber japonicus, Scomber colias) 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 2\u00a0500\n09.1648 ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a097  Prepared or preserved fillets of frigate tuna or frigate mackerel (Auxis thazard, Auxis rochei) 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 875"}
