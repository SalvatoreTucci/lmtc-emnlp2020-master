Table 2 of that Annex provides for the application of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 to categories of tractors equipped with front power take-off which also sets dimensions for the front PTO location. However, these location requirements are not compatible with a large number of agricultural and forestry tractors due to new design requirements.\n(2) The requirements for front power take-off set out in Directive 86/297/EEC only concern safety issues, that is, the PTO location, the requirements of shielding and the clearance zone. The PTO location imposed by Directive 86/297/EEC is not compatible with several tractor categories currently on the market and their mounted implements. Table 2 of Annex I to Directive 86/297/EEC already excludes tractor categories T4.1 and T4.3 from the location requirements.\n(3) Tractors of categories T1, T2, T3, T4.2 and T5, in addition to those of categories T4.1 and T4.3 currently exempted from the requirements of clause 4.2 of standard ISO 8759-1:1998, cannot comply with such requirements.\n(4) Several tractors can be equipped with special power take-off types, to which standard ISO 8759-1:1998 does not apply.\n(5) In the case of tractors of category T3, the standard only applies when the tractor is equipped with a power take-off specified in that standard. However, other vehicle categories, such as T2 and certain smaller T1 tractors, could be equipped with special power take-off types, which are not covered by the standard. Consequently, exemption from the requirements of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 should also be extended to tractor categories T1 and T2.\n(6) Difficulties of the same kind are encountered in the corresponding C categories.\n(7) As the specifications of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 with the exception of clause 4.2, are to apply to tractors of all T and C categories which are equipped with front power take-offs, Table 2 becomes redundant and should therefore be deleted.\n(8) Directive 86/297/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 86/297/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1) point 4.2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Table 2 is deleted.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 October 2013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
