Here the intention is to ensure that only essentials are maintained and the pits remain viable until the coalfield can be closed down without friction, so that serious economic and social upheaval is avoided;\nWhereas the purpose and type of the aids to cover pit operating losses of the Southern coalfield are therefore compatible with the first subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (2) of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 3 (2) of the Decision, all other measures to assist current production in 1983 must be taken into consideration for an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas, on this basis of assessment, the total amount of aid proposed is 162 500 000 ECU, i.e. 25,37 ECU per tonne; whereas this figure compared with 1982 (26,94 ECU per tonne) shows that there is a reduction of nearly 6 %;\nWhereas the following observations can be made on the compatibility of the proposed current production aids with the proper functioning of the common market:\n- there were no supply difficulties in 1983,\n- rationalization of production in 1983 was achieved by investment,\n- industrial consumers of coal did not receive aid in 1983 as a result of the prices of Belgian coking coal and steam coal;\nWhereas it may be concluded that the aid granted to the Belgian coal-mining industry in 1983 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to the coal-mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC;\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the 1983 calendar year to grant aid totalling Bfrs 5 243 400 000 to the Belgian coal-mining industry.\nThe amount of Bfrs 5 243 400 000 provided in respect of the 1983 calendar year is divided as follows:\n1.
