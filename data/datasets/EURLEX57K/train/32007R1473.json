Bulgaria should therefore be authorised to exempt certain categories of producers from the obligation to distil by-products of winemaking.\n(4) In order that the exception granted to Bulgaria may be applied to the entire wine year, this Regulation should apply from 1 August 2007.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["By way of exemption from Article 49(4)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000, Bulgaria may lay down that, for the 2007/08 wine year, producers who do not exceed a production level of 7\u00a0500\u00a0hl obtained by them on their individual premises may fulfil the obligation to deliver by-products for distillation by having those products withdrawn under supervision.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
