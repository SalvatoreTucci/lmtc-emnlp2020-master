Article 5(2) of that Regulation lays down that, when there is an overrun of this threshold, the aid fixed in Annex I thereto shall be reduced in each Member State in which the threshold has been overrun. Overrunning of the processing threshold is assessed on the basis of the average of the quantities processed under the aid scheme during the three marketing years preceding the marketing year in question, or during an equivalent period.\n(2) The Member States, in accordance with Article 22(1)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1169/97 of 26 June 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/6 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2729/1999(4), have communicated the quantities of lemons processed under the aid scheme. Based on this information, a processing threshold overrun of 37671 tonnes has been established. Within that overrun, an overrun of the threshold for Italy has been established. The amounts of aid for lemons laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for the 2001/02 marketing year must therefore be reduced by 12,17 % in Italy.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 2001/02 marketing year, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2202/96, the amounts of aid for lemons delivered for processing shall be amended as follows:\n>TABLE>", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 49.\n(2) OJ L 311, 12.12.2000, p. 9.\n(3) OJ L 169, 27.6.1997, p. 15.\n(4) OJ L 328, 22.12.1999, p. 35."}
