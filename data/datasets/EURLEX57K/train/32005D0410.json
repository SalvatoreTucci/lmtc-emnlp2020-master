The reason given for this request is the need to consolidate the positive effects of the application of the measure implemented in June 2002, and in particular to discourage the development of new plantations outside traditional production areas, in order to protect the environment, particularly as regards the use of water resources, soil stability and the socioeconomic balance, and conservation of the characteristic features of the countryside.\n(4) Examination of Spain\u2019s request to extend the measure excluding produce from compensatory aid for a period of three years shows that it complies with the aim and the provisions of Article 12(9) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93. This request should therefore be accepted.\n(5) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["Spain\u2019s request to the Commission to extend, for a further three-year period, the measure excluding the produce of new banana plantations planted on or after 1 June 2002 from the compensatory aid referred to in Article 12(9) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, authorised by Decision 2002/414/EC, is hereby accepted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 47, 25.2.1993, p. 1.
