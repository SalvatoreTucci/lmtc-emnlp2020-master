Bovine milk\nA. Sampling requirements\n- Each official sample must be taken by the official competent authorities in such way that it is always possible to trace it back to the farm of origin of the milk.\n- The samples, according to the choice of the Member States, can be taken:\n(a) either at farm level from the collection tank,\n(b) or at the level of the dairy industry before the bulk tanker has discharged.\n- Derogation from the above principle of traceability to the farm of origin can be accepted for the substances or residues designated in Annex I group B 3 (a), (b) and (c) of Council Directive 96/23/EC.\n- Samples must be taken only from raw milk.\nThe sample size will depend on the analytical methods used.\nB. Sampling level and frequency\nThe annual number of samples is 1 per 15 000 tonnes of the annual production of milk, with a minimum of 300 samples.\nThe following breakdown must be respected:\n(a) 70 % of the samples must be examined for the presence of residues of veterinary drugs. In this case, each sample has to be tested for at least four different compounds from at least three groups among groups A 6, B 1, B 2 (a) and B 2 (e) of Annex I to the Directive.\n(b) 15 % of the samples must be tested for the presence of residues designated in group B 3 of Annex I to Directive 96/23/EC.\n(c) The balance (15 %) must be allocated according to the situation of the Member State.\n2. Milk from other species (ovine, caprine, equine)\nThe number of samples for these species must be determined by each Member State according to the level of production and the problems identified. The milk from these species must be included in the sampling plan as additional samples to those taken for bovine milk.\nCHAPTER 2\nEGGS\n1. Hen eggs\nA. Sampling requirements\n- Each official sample must be taken by official competent authorities in such way that it is always possible to trace it back to the farm of origin of the eggs.\n- The samples, according to the choice of the Member States, can be taken:\n(a) either at farm level;\n(b) or at the level of the packing centre.\n- The sample size is at least 12 eggs or more, according to the analytical methods used.\nB. Sampling level and frequency\nThe number of samples to be taken each year must be at least equal to 1 per 1 000 tonnes of the annual production of consumption eggs, with a minimum of 200 samples. The breakdown of samples may be decided by each Member State according to the structure of its industry, particularly as regards levels of integration within it.\nAt least 30 % of samples must be collected from packing centres which represent the most significant proportion of eggs supplied for human consumption.\nThe following breakdown must be respected:\n- 70 % of the samples must be tested for at least one compound from each following group: groups A 6, B 1 and B 2 (b) mentioned in Annex II to Directive 96/23/EC.\n- 30 % of the samples must be allocated according to the situation in the individual Member State, but must include some analyses for substances in Group B 3 (a) of Annex I.\n2. Eggs from other species of poultry\nThe number of samples for these species is to be determined by each Member State according to the level of production and the problems identified. The eggs from these species must be included in the sampling plan as additional samples to those taken for hen eggs.\nCHAPTER 3\nRABBIT MEAT AND THE MEAT OF WILD GAME AND FARMED GAME\n1.
