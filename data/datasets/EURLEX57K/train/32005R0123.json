The Committee mentioned also that further studies are ongoing to elucidate the mechanisms involved in OTA carcinogenicity. It is anticipated that the European research project on the mechanisms of OTA induced carcinogenicity will be finished by the end of 2004. Once the comprehensive research results are available, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be requested by the Commission to update the scientific opinion from SCF in the light of these new research results.\n(4) An assessment of the dietary intake of OTA by the population of the Community has been performed in the framework of Council Directive 1993/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food\u00a0(3) (SCOOP). The main contributor to the OTA exposure is cereal and cereal products. Wine, coffee and beer were identified as significant contributors to the human OTA exposure. Dried vine fruit and grape juice contributed to a significant extent to the OTA-exposure for specific groups of vulnerable groups of consumers such as children.\n(5) A maximum level for OTA has been established for cereal and cereal products and dried vine fruit by Regulation (EC) 466/2001. The level of OTA in beer is indirectly controlled as the OTA in beer originates from the presence of OTA in malt, for which a maximum level has been established. The setting of a maximum level for OTA in beer is therefore not immediately necessary to protect public health, but should be considered in the frame of the foreseen review.\n(6) Given the significant contribution of wine and roasted coffee together with soluble coffee to the OTA human exposure and the significant contribution of grape juice to the OTA exposure of children, it is appropriate to set already at this stage for these foodstuffs maximum levels to protect public health by preventing the distribution of unacceptably highly contaminated foodstuffs.\n(7) OTA has also been observed in dried fruit other than dried vine fruit, cocoa and cocoa products, spices and liquorice. The appropriateness of setting a maximum level for OTA in these foodstuffs, including green coffee, as well a review of the existing maximum levels will be considered after the availability of the EFSA assessment of the research results on OTA toxicology.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4(2) point (b), \u2018and 2.2.2\u2019 is replaced by \u2018, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 and 2.2.5\u2019.\n2. in Article 5, paragraph 2a is replaced by the following:\n3.
