2371/2002 the Council adopts the necessary measures governing access to areas and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries.\n(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 the Council establishes the fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of those opportunities to Member States.\n(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.\n(4) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions relevant to the allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(5) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures must be identified therein.\n(6) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures relating to the technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2008.\n(7) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with the Community legislation on the subject, in particular with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3) and Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms\u00a0(4).\n(8) Bearing in mind that in a Member State where before the entry into force of this Regulation nets with a mesh size less than 200\u00a0mm were traditionally used to catch turbot, and in order to allow adequate adaptation to the technical measures introduced in this Regulation, that Member State shall be permitted to fish for turbot using nets with a minimum mesh size of no less than 180\u00a0mm.\n(9) In view of the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of
