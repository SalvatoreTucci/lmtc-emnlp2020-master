The Community receives 70 % of Greenland's share of the capelin TAC (total allowable catches) which is decided in June and available to all Member States. To enable the summer season fishing to start earlier than has been the case in recent years the Commission should be empowered to decide on the issue.\n(3) In accordance with the procedure provided for in the Agreement on fisheries between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway(4), the Community has held consultations with the Kingdom of Norway. The delegations agreed to recommend to their respective authorities to allocate a quota of 40000 tonnes of sand eel to Norway in Community waters, while quotas of 2500 tonnes of haddock and 1500 tonnes of plaice in the North Sea are to be transferred from Norway to the Community. Furthermore it has been agreed to recommend that the Community have access to fish 48493 tonnes of Atlanto-Scandian herring in Norwegian waters north of 62\u00b0 N and that Norway have access to fish 48493 tonnes of Atlanto-Scandian herring in Community waters north of 62\u00b0 N, and that the share of the Community out of the jointly shared NEAFC quota for mackerel in international waters be 7520 tonnes. The necessary measures should be taken to implement the results of the consultations in Community legislation.\n(4) In the Agreed Record of Conclusions of Fisheries Consultations between the European Community and Norway of 20 December 2002, it was agreed to recommend to the respective authorities to allow that 40000 tonnes of Norway pout in zone IV (Norwegian waters) be fished by the European Community as sand eel.\n(5) In accordance with the procedure provided for in the Agreement on fisheries between the European Economic Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faeroe Islands of the other part(5), the Community has held consultations with the Home Government of the Faeroe Islands. The delegations agreed to recommend to their respective authorities that the parties have access to fish 6022 tonnes of Atlanto-Scandian herring in the waters of the other party north of 62\u00b0 N. The necessary measures should be taken to implement the results of the consultations in Community legislation.\n(6) While awaiting a long term management agreement on the blue whiting stock with the coastal States concerned, it is appropriate for the Community to set a quota available to all Member States at 250000 tonnes in ICES divisions I, II, V, VI, VII, XII and XIV (International waters).\n(7) In January 2003 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a TAC for northern prawn of 13000 tonnes in NAFO Division 3L for the Community. This measure should therefore be implemented by the Community.\n(8) Following the Community emergency measures on closure of cod fishing with trawls for all vessels in the EC waters of the Baltic Sea from 15 April until 31 May 2003, Estonia has requested that Estonian trawl fishing be allowed in Community waters from 1 September to 15 October of this year. The Council considers it appropriate to amend Annex VI part II to Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 as necessary.\n(9) Due to exceptional circumstances, Lithuania has requested the EC to give it back 800 tonnes of the herring quota which Lithuania granted to the EC to be fished in its waters for 2003, thus reducing the corresponding Community quota. In exchange, Lithuania's authorities have agreed to offer the Community 800 tonnes of herring in its waters from its national quota to be fixed by the IBSFC for the year 2004. The Council considers it appropriate to amend Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 as necessary.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3 the following paragraph shall be added:\n\"4.
