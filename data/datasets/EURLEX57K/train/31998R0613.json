whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\nWhereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\nWhereas potassium nitrate, potassium dl-aspartate, potassium glucuronate and potassium glycerophosphate should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, florfenicol and moxidectin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for albendazole sulphoxide and carprofen;\nWhereas it appears that maximum residue limits cannot be established for metronidazole because residues, at whatever limit, in foodstuffs of animal origin might constitute a hazard to the health of the consumer, whereas it should be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851 /EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III and IV of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 March 1998.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 53, 24. 2. 1998, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nA.
