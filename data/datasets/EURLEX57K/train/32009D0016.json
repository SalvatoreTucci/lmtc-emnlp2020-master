The specification states that the link between the cheese \u2018Germantas\u2019 and its area is based on its specific method of production that confers it specific organoleptic characteristics that distinguish it from other cheeses. The specification reaffirms that organoleptic characteristics specific to the cheese \u2018Germantas\u2019, its faint yellowish colour with greenish to greyish nuances, a light aroma of acidified milk, whey and pasteurised milk, and a little sour flavour of pasteurised milk at high temperature, are related to its production method. The specification furthermore explains that typical colour of cheese \u2018Germantas\u2019 is due to its maturing in transparent, or coloured, film that reduces decomposition of the photosensitive compounds under the light. In the absence of a link between these factors and the geographical origin, the application does not meet the basic criteria for registration as a protected geographical indication.\n(5) A link within the meaning of the second indent of Article 2(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 has therefore not been demonstrated.\n(6) In the light of the above, the application to register the name \u2018Germantas\u2019 as a protected geographical indication should be rejected.\n(7) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["The application to register the name \u2018Germantas\u2019 is hereby rejected.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a093, 31.3.2006, p.\u00a012."}
