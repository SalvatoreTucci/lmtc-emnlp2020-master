It provides that detailed rules, required by the epidemiological situation to supplement the minimum control measures provided for in that Directive, are to be laid down.\n(2) Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC\u00a0(4) lays down certain protection measures to be applied in order to prevent the spread of that disease, including the establishment of areas A and B following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of the disease. Those areas are listed in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC and at present include parts of Germany and Poland. That Decision currently applies until 30 June 2008.\n(3) Since there is a continuing risk of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 within the Community, the measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC should be maintained in order to be used where that virus is detected in poultry, thereby supplementing the measures provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC.\n(4) Given the current epidemiological situation in relation to avian influenza in the Community, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of Decision 2006/415/EC until 30 June 2009.\n(5) Germany and Poland have notified the Commission that, due to the favourable disease situation on their territory, they are no longer applying protection measures in relation to outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1. The measures established in accordance with Article 4(2) of Decision 2006/415/CE for areas A and B in those Member States are therefore no longer necessary.\n(6) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/415/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
