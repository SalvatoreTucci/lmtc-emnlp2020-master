Those Reports concluded that the LTE (Long Term Evolution) and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) systems can be introduced in the 900 MHz and 1\u00a0800 MHz bands using appropriate values for the separation between the channel edges of the respective carriers.\n(5) As regards coexistence between UMTS, LTE and WiMAX and aeronautical systems above 960 MHz, CEPT Reports 41 and 42 provide information and recommendations on how to mitigate interference.\n(6) The results of the work carried out pursuant to the mandate issued to CEPT should be applied in the Union and Member States should be required to implement as soon as possible given the increasing market demand for the introduction of LTE and WiMAX in these bands. In addition, Member States should ensure that UMTS, LTE and WiMAX give appropriate protection to existing systems in adjacent bands.\n(7) Harmonised standards EN 301908-21 and EN 301908-22 are being finalised by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in order to give presumption of conformity with Article 3(2) of Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\u00a0(4).\n(8) The Annex to Decision 2009/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2009/766/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nNeelie KROES\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 32.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 196, 17.7.1987, p. 85.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nLIST OF TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 3 AND ARTICLE 4(2)\nThe following technical parameters shall be applied as an essential component of the conditions necessary to ensure coexistence in the absence of bilateral or multilateral agreements between neighbouring networks, without precluding less stringent technical parameters if agreed among the operators of such networks.\nSystems Technical parameters Implementation deadlines\n1.
