This time the farm statistical registers, which are a prerequisite for all farm surveys and a real difficulty in most of the Member States, are the main area of the annual action plan.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the opinion of the Standing Committee of Agricultural Statistics,", "main_body": ["The 2005 technical action plan for improving agricultural statistics (TAPAS 2005), as set out in the Annex, is approved.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nJoaqu\u00edn ALMUNIA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 162, 1.7.1996, p. 14. Decision as last amended by Decision No 787/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 138, 30.4.2004, p. 12).\nANNEX\n2005 TECHNICAL ACTION PLAN FOR IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS\n(TAPAS 2005)\nThe measures covered by the 2005 technical action plan for improving agricultural statistics aim to develop or improve statistics in the following areas:\n(a) farm statistical registers,\n(b) surveys on small farms (small units surveys).\nThe Commission will make a financial contribution to projects developed as part of these measures which will not exceed the amounts shown in Table A for each Member State.\nThe measures proposed by the Member States concern:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farm statistical registers\nThe availability of an up to date register of agricultural holdings is a basis for a coherent and integrated system of agricultural statistics and also, if coordinated with national business registers, a tool contributing to the integration of agricultural information with that of other sectors.\nA valid register provides a basic framework for sampling. If it is complete and includes appropriate information, it may permit effective sample design with, for example, stratification by size, type of activity and location. It could even call into question the cost-effectiveness of full agricultural censuses. Registers also provide useful information for the demography of agricultural holdings.\nA harmonised register would also open the door to EU sampling and surveys providing reliable estimates at EU level and substantially reducing the burden on respondents.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Small units surveys\n\u2018Small units\u2019 are important, in terms of numbers and share in agricultural production, especially in the new Member States. In some of these countries, small units are not always adequately covered in the agricultural surveys, and this might thus lead to the exclusion of a large number of units engaged in the production of agricultural goods.\nIn the framework of the TAPAS 2005 actions on small units, Eurostat expects contributions, inter alia, on the following questions:\nWhat should be the definition of small units?\nWhat should be the minimum threshold for the inclusion of such units in the Farm Statistical Registers?\nTo what extent should small units included in such registers be covered (in terms of frequency, characteristics)?\nTable A\nTECHNICAL ACTION PLAN 2005\nEU-25\nMaximum financial contribution of the Community to expenditure incurred\n(thousand EUR)\nCountries Farm register Small units Total\nCZ 60\u00a0000  60\u00a0000\nDE 243\u00a0000  243\u00a0000\nEE 53\u00a0856  53\u00a0856\nIT 311\u00a0440  311\u00a0440\nCY 42\u00a0000  42\u00a0000\nLV 64\u00a0069 18\u00a0083 82\u00a0152\nLT  9\u00a0000 9\u00a0000\nHU  29\u00a0700 29\u00a0700\nAT 446\u00a0639  446\u00a0639\nPL 45\u00a0000  45\u00a0000\nPT 175\u00a0844  175\u00a0844\nSI  113\u00a0400 113\u00a0400\nSK 54\u00a0000 45\u00a0000 99\u00a0000\nUK 187\u00a0000  187\u00a0000\nTotal 1\u00a0682\u00a0849 215\u00a0183 1\u00a0898\u00a0032"}
