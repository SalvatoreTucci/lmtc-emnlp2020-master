Purpose of the programme\nImprovement and rationalization of marketing/distribution networks for fish and fish products and, in the processing sector, modernization of existing facilities and access to new markets.\n2. Delimitation of the area concerned by the programme\nThe whole of Italy.\n3. Duration of the programme\nThe programme covers the period from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1988.\n4. Objectives of the programme\nFor the processing sector:\n- the maintenance of present production capacity and the containment of the costs of production by mechanization of processing lines,\n- the upgrading and promotion of traditional products and new products,\n- the rationalization of supplies of raw materials.\nFor the marketing/distribution of fish and fish products:\n- the development of refrigerated units and purification plants,\n- the rationalization of marketing networks.\n5. Estimated investments\nTo attain the specified objectives, and particularly to contain the costs of production and create new products, the total investment for the duration of the programme is estimated to be 110 million ECU, allocated as follows:\n- processing of tuna, mackerel, sardine, anchovy, clam: 50,0 million ECU,\n- refrigeration and deep-freezing installations: 40,3 million ECU,\n- wholesale centres, auction markets and purification facilities: 20,0 million ECU.\nThe financial data, as well as the breakdown between various types of investments, are indicative.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by Italy as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes constitutes a suitable basis to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish and fish products.\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of resources and of the consequences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n2. Given that the structural measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture, foreseen for 1987 and later, may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for processing and marketing of fish products.\n3. Furthermore, investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n4. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no financial aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product. With regard to the processing of clams, particular attention will have to be paid to the resources of shellfish, which determine the supplies available to this sector.\n5. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in these programmes do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community."}
