Following the transitional measures included in Article 39(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3) that provision is no longer applicable.\n(3) In accordance with Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, initial allocations shall be adjusted on the basis of actual expenditure and revised expenditure forecasts submitted by the Member States taking into account programmes objectives.\n(4) In accordance with Article 57(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)\u00a0(4), the Commission shall adapt the initial allocations per Member State fixed by Decision 1999/659/EC within two months of the adoption of the budget for the financial year concerned.\n(5) The adaptation of the initial allocations has to take into account the financial execution realised by Member States in the years 2000-2005 and the revised forecasts for the year 2006, submitted before 1 October 2005. Following the provisions of Article 55(1)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004, the expenditure forecasts for 2006 indicate that an amount of the budget appropriations for 2006 will be left unspent. In accordance with Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the Commission shall reallocate the unused funds among the Member States which foresee to fully use their financial envelopes for the programming period 2000-2006, following the distribution key of the initial allocations included in Decision 1999/659/EC.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001\u00a0(5) provides that the amounts resulting from the modulation shall be available as additional Community support for measures under rural development programming financed under the EAGGF \u2018Guarantee\u2019 Section to Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.\n(7) By Commission Decision C(2005) 5314 of 19 December 2005\u00a0(6), amounts resulting from the modulation pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 have been allocated to the Member States.
