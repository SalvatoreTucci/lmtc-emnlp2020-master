whereas  the wine must be put up in containers holding two litres or less; whereas the wine must be accompanied either by a certificate of designation of origin in accordance with the model given in Annex D to the Agreement or, by way of derogation, by a  document VI 1 or a VI 2 extract annotated in compliance with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3590/85 (3);\nWhereas, however, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey on the other (4) provides for the  Portuguese Republic to defer until 31 December 1990 the application of the preferential arrangements for the products in question; whereas, consequently this Regulation does not apply to Portugal; whereas the Community tariff quota in question should be  opened for 1989;\nWhereas the wine in question is subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas, in order that such wine may benefit from this tariff quota, Article 54 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 (5) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No  2964/88 (6) must be complied with;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into the Member States until the quota is  exhausted;\nWhereas, for the period of application of this Regulation, it appears necessary to maintain an allocation between the Member States of the quotas concerned, since the administrations of the Member States are unable to provide by 1 January 1989, for the  administrative and technical conditions required for the Community management of quotas for these products originating in Algeria; whereas it does, however, seem advisable to provide for a further increase in the Community reserve;\nWhereas provision should be made for a mechanism to prevent, when the Community quota is not used up, goods from being imported into a Member State which has used up its share only after the full application of customs duties, or after having been  diverted to another Member State whose share has not yet been used up; whereas, under these circumstances, if, during the quota period, the Community reserve were to be almost entirely used up, Member States should return to the said reserve all of the  unused portion of their initial shares so as to avoid part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State, when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, taking into account the traditional trends in trade, the allocation maintained between Member States must, so as to reflect as closely as possible the actual market trend of the products in question, be carried out pro rata the needs of the  Member States, calculated, on the one hand, on the basis of the statistical data relating to imports of the said products from Algeria over a representative reference period and, on the other hand, on the basis of the economic outlook for the quota  periods considered;\nWhereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each type of wine in question are available and no reliable forecasts of future imports can be made; whereas in these circumstances the quota volumes  should be allocated in initial shares, account being taken ot the effective utilization of these wines on the markets of the various Member States;\nWhereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any  subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial share and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, the first part of  the tariff quota should be set at a certain level, which in this case could be 40 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission and the Commission must be able to keep account of quota utilization rates and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.

Member States shall be informed by the Commission in accordance with the same procedures.\n3.  Within a time limit fixed by the Commission as from the date referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, Member States shall be required to return to the reserve all the quantities which have not been used on that date, within the meaning  of Article 5 (3) and (4).", "The Commission shall keep an account of the shares drawn by the Member States pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 and shall, as soon as it has been notified, inform each State of the extent to which the reserves have been used up.\nIt shall inform the Member States, of the amounts still in reserve after amounts have been returned thereto pursuant to Article 3.\nIt shall ensure that the drawing which uses up a reserve does not exceed the balance available and to this end shall notify the amount of that balance to the Member State making the last drawing.", "1.
