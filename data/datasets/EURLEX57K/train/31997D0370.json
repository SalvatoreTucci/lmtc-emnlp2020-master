Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Intrascope (Optical Probe)`.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 mm (and of 19 mm at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an operating distance of between 3 and 45 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 70,200-0,733 x1\nwhere:\n^y = the estimated lean meat of the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase immediately behind the last rib.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms.\nPART 2\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)`.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 mm (and of 6,3 mm at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 mm. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP II itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 59,090-0,500 x1-0,353 x2+0,193 x3\nwhere:\n^y = the estimated percentage of lean meat of the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase immediately behind the last rib,\nx2 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx3 = the thickness of muscle (M. longissimus dorsi) in millimetres measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms."}
