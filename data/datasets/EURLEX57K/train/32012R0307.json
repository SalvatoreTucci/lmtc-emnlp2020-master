One of the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 is that the intake of the substance should greatly exceed normal intake of a balanced and varied diet and it should present a potential risk to consumers as demonstrated by relevant scientific data. Further, Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 provides that the procedure should also be applied where the substance presents a potential risk to health for reasons other than a great excess of its normal intake. In addition, Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 provides that the substance should be added to foods or used in the manufacture of foods.\n(2) For the purpose of the application of the condition mentioned above, dietary intakes of the concerned substance that greatly exceed those expected under normal conditions of consumption of a balanced and varied diet should reflect actual intake of the substance and not a theoretical assumption of intake, and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis in comparison with the average level of intake of the substance by the general adult population or other population groups for which potential risks to consumers have been identified.\n(3) The Member State putting forward a request should provide the necessary information to demonstrate that the conditions required by Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 are met. This should include information on the placing on the market of food products containing the substance and the available and relevant generally accepted scientific evidence that associates the substance with a potential risk to consumers. Only those requests ascertained as complete should be sent to the European Food Safety Authority (hereafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) for a safety assessment based on the available information. The Authority should adopt an opinion on the safety of the substance within a specified time limit as laid down in Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2). Interested parties should be allowed to submit comments to the Commission following the publication of the opinion by the Authority.\n(4) Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 states that food business operators, or any other interested parties, may at any time submit for evaluation to the Authority a file containing the scientific data demonstrating the safety of a substance listed in Annex III, Part C to that Regulation, under the conditions of its use in a food or in a category of foods and explaining the purpose of that use. Any such file submitted by a food business operator or interested party should be based on guidance documents adopted or endorsed by the Authority, such as the guidance on submissions for safety evaluation of sources of nutrients or of other ingredients proposed for use in the manufacture of food, or any further revised version of such guidance.\n(5) In order for the Commission to take a decision concerning a substance included in Annex III, Part C to Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 within the required deadline, it is necessary to take into consideration only those files submitted within 18 months from the date a substance has been included in that Annex. Furthermore, in order for the Commission to take a decision within the stipulated deadline, the Authority should give its opinion on the safety of the substance within a time limit of nine months from receiving a file that is considered to be valid and complete in accordance with the guidance documents adopted or endorsed by the Authority.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes implementing rules for the application of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 and in particular:\n(a) the conditions for the use of the procedure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006; and\n(b) the procedure referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 concerning substances listed in Annex III, Part C thereto.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018request\u2019 means the submission to the Commission by a Member State of information, including scientific data, for the purpose of initiating the procedure under paragraph 2 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006;\n(b) \u2018file\u2019 means a file as referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 that is submitted by a food business operator or interested party to the Authority;\n(c) \u2018placing on the market\u2019 as defined by Article 3(8) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.", "Conditions to be met for the request\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the assessment of the conditions under which the concerned substance is added to foods or used in the manufacture of foods, as laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006, the placing on the market in one or more Member States of the food product to which the substance has been added shall be taken into account.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may submit a request to the Commission when the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shows at least one of the following:\n(a) a potential risk to consumers is associated with the ingestion of amounts of the substance that greatly exceed those reasonably expected under normal conditions of consumption of a balanced and varied diet, due to the conditions under which the substance is added to food or used in the manufacture of food;\n(b) a potential risk to consumers is associated with the consumption of this substance by the general adult population or other specified population group for which a potential risk has been identified.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation those conditions that would result in the ingestion of amounts of a substance greatly exceeding those reasonably expected to be ingested under normal conditions of consumption of a balanced and varied diet shall occur under actual circumstances and shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis in comparison with the average intake of the concerned substance by the general adult population or other specified population group for which health concerns have been raised.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conditions and requirements laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article and the requirements laid down in Article 4 of this Regulation, shall apply mutatis mutandis where the procedure under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 is initiated by the Commission.", "Content of the request\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request shall contain the available and relevant generally accepted scientific evidence demonstrating that the conditions specified in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 are met and shall include:\n(a) Evidence demonstrating the addition of the substance to food or use of the substance in the manufacture of food.\n(b) In cases referred to in Article 3(2)(a), evidence demonstrating that intake of the substance greatly exceeds normal conditions of consumption of a balanced and varied diet, as assessed in accordance with Article 3(3).\n(c) Evidence demonstrating a potential risk to consumers from consumption of the substance.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission may ask the Member State to provide clarifications or additional information if the request is incomplete.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall publish any complete request made by a Member State on its official website.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall send the request to the Authority accompanied by all the available information, following consultation of the Member States.
