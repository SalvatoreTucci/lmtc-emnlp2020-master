Those ecological criteria and the related assessment and verification requirements are valid until 31 March 2010.\n(5) In the light of that review, it is appropriate, in order to take account of scientific and market developments, to modify the definition of the product group and to establish new ecological criteria.\n(6) The ecological criteria, as well as the related assessment and verification requirements, should be valid for four years from the date of adoption of this Decision.\n(7) Decision 2002/231/EC should therefore be replaced.\n(8) A transitional period should be allowed for producers whose products have been awarded the eco-label for footwear based on the criteria contained in Decision 2002/231/EC, so that they have sufficient time to adapt their products to comply with the revised criteria and requirements. Producers should also be allowed to submit applications set out under the criteria set in Decision 2002/231/EC or set out under the criteria set in this Decision until the lapse of validity of that Decision.\n(9) Measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,", "main_body": ["The product group \u2018footwear\u2019 shall comprise all articles of clothing designed to protect or cover the foot, with a fixed outer sole which comes into contact with the ground.
