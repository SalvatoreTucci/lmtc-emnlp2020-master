For a number of products, Appendix 2A to that Annex provides for the possibility of derogations from the rules of origin set out in Appendix 2 to Annex II in the framework of annual quotas.

Annex II should be managed on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council
