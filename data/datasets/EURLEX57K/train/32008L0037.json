More particularly, those measures are designed to extend the list of legal forms, clarify or adjust the items constituting the solvency margin, increase the premiums or claims amounts used for the calculation of the solvency margin for certain reinsurance activities or contract types, alter the minimum guarantee fund, and clarify definitions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2005/68/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 2005/68/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive 2005/68/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States. It is therefore not necessary to lay down provisions to that effect,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 2005/68/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
