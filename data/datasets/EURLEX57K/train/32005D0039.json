The goal of this study will be to examine the feasibility and to evaluate the cost of alternative risk financing instruments options with a view to determining potential impact on the national and EU budgets and sustainable levels of national support for direct losses.\n(7) The results of this study could form a basis to consider on the one hand the harmonisation of EU financing schemes, with a view at least to put farmers in an equal position across the EU, and on the other hand to analyse the future of the veterinary fund in the enlarged Community.\n(8) According to Article 15 of the Internal Rules of 2004 for the execution of the budget, an annual work programme may also be considered to be the financing decision provided that it constitutes a sufficiently detailed framework, and the evaluation, study and review foreseen in this decision constitute such a framework.\n(9) Appropriations which may be used without a basic act, in accordance with Article 49(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation, must nevertheless be covered by a decision taken by the Commission offering an equivalent framework.\n(10) Therefore, this decision should constitute a framework equivalent to a financing decision within the meaning of Article 75(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(2).\n(11) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Sole Article\nThe actions described in the Annex to this Decision are approved for the purpose of their financing."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
