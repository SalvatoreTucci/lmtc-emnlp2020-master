The provisional maximum residue limits for that substance set out for ovine and caprine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk expired on 1 July 2014.\n(4) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) recommended an extension of the provisional MRL as the analytical method for monitoring residues in ovine and caprine species is not sufficiently validated. The incomplete scientific data on the validation of the analytical method is not considered to constitute a hazard to human health.\n(5) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The CVMP concluded that the extrapolation to other food producing species cannot be supported for this substance.\n(6) The entry for eprinomectin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to extend the provisional MRL to 30 June 2016.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 22 February 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance \u2018eprinomectin\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Eprinomectin Eprinomectin B1a Bovine 50 \u03bcg/kg Muscle NO ENTRY Antiparasitic agents/Agents acting against endo- and ectoparasites\u2019\nOvine, caprine 50 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Provisional maximum residue limits expire on 30 June 2016"}
