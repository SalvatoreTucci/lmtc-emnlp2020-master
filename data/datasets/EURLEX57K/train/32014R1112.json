That information should enable Member States to provide advanced warning of the potential deterioration of safety and environmentally critical barriers, and should enable them to take preventive action, including in light of their obligations under Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (Marine Strategy Framework Directive)\u00a0(2).\n(2) The information should also demonstrate the overall effectiveness of measures and controls implemented by individual operators and owners, and the industry as a whole, to prevent major accidents and to minimise risks for the environment. In addition, the information and data provided should ensure that the performance of individual operators and owners can be compared within the Member State and the performance of the industry as a whole can be compared between Member States.\n(3) The sharing of comparable data between Member States is rendered difficult and unreliable due to the lack of a common data reporting format across all Member States. A common format for the reporting of data by operators and owners to the Member State should provide transparency of the safety and environmental performance of operators and owners and should provide Union-wide comparable information on safety of offshore oil and gas operations and should facilitate dissemination of lessons learned from major accidents and near misses.\n(4) To facilitate public confidence in the authority and integrity of offshore oil and gas operations in the Union, Member States should periodically publish the information referred to in point 2 of Annex IX of Directive 2013/30/EU pursuant to Article 24 of Directive 2013/30/EU. A common format and details of information to be made publicly available by the Member States should enable easy cross-border comparison of data.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Safety of Offshore Oil and Gas Operations,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation specifies common formats in relation to:\n(a) reports from operators and owners of offshore oil and gas installations to competent authorities of Member States in accordance with Article 23 of Directive 2013/30/EU;\n(b) publication of information by Member States in accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2013/30/EU.", "Reporting reference and remittance dates\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operators and owners of offshore oil and gas installations shall submit the report referred to in Article 1(a) within 10 working days of the event.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reporting period for information referred to in Article 1(b) shall be each year from 1 January until 31 December, starting as of the calendar year 2016.

Annex IX, point 2, to Directive 2013/30/EUcontains leading and lagging key performance indicators (KPI's) in order to provide a good picture about offshore oil and gas safety within a Member State and in the European Union, but some of the KPI's have a warning function like failures of safety and environmental critical elements (SECE) and fatalities.\nc.
