Since Community demand for the products in question is to be met under the most favourable conditions, certain existing tariff quotas should be extended or adjusted, and some new Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for these products.\n(2) Since the quota amount for one Community tariff quota is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period, it should be increased with effect from 1 January 2007.\n(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2007 for certain products on which duties were suspended in 2006. These products should therefore be removed from the table in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.\n(4) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 to be replaced in its entirety.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In view of the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.\n(7) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 January 2007, it should enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 shall be replaced by the text appearing in the Annex to this Regulation.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2006, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2981 shall be fixed at 260\u00a0000 units.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2007, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96:\n\u2014 the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2002 shall be fixed at 1\u00a0000 tonnes,\n\u2014 the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2030 shall be fixed at 1\u00a0000 tonnes,\n\u2014 the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2612 shall be fixed at 1\u00a0900 tonnes,\n\u2014 the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2620 shall be fixed at 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 units,\n\u2014 the amount of the tariff quota for order number 09.2727 shall be fixed at 15\u00a0000 tonnes.", "In Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96, tariff quotas for order numbers 09.2920, 09.2970, 09.2972 and 09.2977, shall be inserted with effect from 1 January 2007.", "Tariff quotas for order numbers 09.2026, 09.2853, 09.2976 and 09.2981 shall be closed with effect from 1 January 2007.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
