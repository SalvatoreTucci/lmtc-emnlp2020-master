In particular bluetongue serotype 8 occurred for the first time in Austria and Sweden. New outbreaks of bluetongue serotype 8 were identified in Denmark and Spain. In addition, bluetongue serotype 1 further spread in France, Spain and Portugal.\n(3) As the outbreaks in Austria and Sweden occurred after publication of Decision 2008/655/EC, these two Member States submitted their vaccination plans too late to meet the deadline set in Article 4(2) of that Decision. Therefore provisions related to the intermediate reports, including those relating to the reduction of the contribution from the Community should not apply to those Member States.\n(4) The Member States concerned have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the occurrence of the disease. Those Member States have presented their new or amended plans for emergency vaccination indicating the approximate number of vaccine doses to be used in 2007 and 2008 and the estimated costs of carrying out those vaccinations. The Commission has assessed the new plans submitted by Austria and Sweden and the amended plans submitted by Denmark, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal from both the veterinary and the financial point of view and the plans were found to comply with relevant Community veterinary legislation. The vaccination of animals against bluetongue in the Member States concerned should therefore be approved in accordance with Article 9(2) of Directive 2000/75/EC.\n(5) The eligibility of expenditure is currently restricted to costs paid in the period 1 November 2007 to 31 December 2008. However, the emergency vaccination plans run until the end of 2008. Therefore, the operative event of carrying out vaccination should determine the eligibility of expenditure. Measures with an operative event falling within the above mentioned period are eligible for co-financing.\n(6) Decision 2008/655/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/655/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, the first subparagraph is replaced by following:\n2. in Article 2(1), the first subparagraph is replaced by following:\n3. in Article 4(1), the letter (d) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(d) a final financial report, in computerized form in accordance with the Annex, on the costs incurred by the Member State during the period 1 November 2007 to 31 December 2008 and paid before the submission of the report;\u2019;\n4. in Article 4(1), the following subparagraph is added:", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 January 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0327, 22.12.2000, p.\u00a074.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a019.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0214, 9.8.2008, p.\u00a066."}
