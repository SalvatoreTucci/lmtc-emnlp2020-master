Furthermore, the Security Council called upon all Member States of the United Nations to make available humanitarian and related assistance in Libya.\n(2) In its Resolution on the situation in Libya, adopted on 17 March 2011 (UNSCR 1973 (2011)), the Security Council recalled UNSCR 1970 (2011) and expressed its determination to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian populated areas and the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance and the safety of humanitarian personnel. It also welcomed the response of neighbouring States, in particular Tunisia and Egypt, to address the needs of refugees and foreign workers and called on the international community to support those efforts.\n(3) Furthermore, the Security Council authorised Member States having notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting nationally or through regional organisations or arrangements and in cooperation with him and with the Member States of the League of Arab States, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory.\n(4) In its conclusions of 21 March 2011, the Council expressed its concern at the situation in Libya and condemned the gross and systematic violation of human rights, violence and brutal repression perpetrated by the regime against the Libyan people. It expressed its satisfaction at the adoption of UNSCR 1973 (2011) and underlined the Union\u2019s determination to contribute to its implementation and to act collectively and resolutely, with all international partners, particularly the League of Arab States and other regional stakeholders, to that effect. It confirmed that the Union\u2019s main aim is the protection of the civilian population and support for the Libyan people to realise their aspirations for a democratic society.\n(5) On 24 March 2011 the Council approved a Crisis Management Concept in response to the crisis in Libya. Further planning should focus on the support to humanitarian assistance. In particular, the operation will not impact on the neutrality or impartiality of the humanitarian actors. Any decision to launch the operation must be preceded by a request from OCHA and must be taken in the light of a current risk and threat assessment.\n(6) Close coordination and consultation is taking place with the Governments of Egypt and Tunisia in order to ensure their authorisation for a possible Union military presence in their respective countries.\n(7) The Political and Security Committee (PSC) should exercise, under the responsibility of the Council and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the High Representative), political control over the Union military operation, provide it with strategic direction, and take the relevant decisions in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 38 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n(8) It is necessary to negotiate and conclude international agreements relating to the participation of third States in Union operations and relating to the status of Union forces and personnel.\n(9) The operational expenditure arising from this Decision, which has military or defence implications, should be borne by the Member States pursuant to Article 41(2) TEU and in accordance with Council Decision 2008/975/CFSP of 18 December 2008 establishing a mechanism to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications (\u2018ATHENA\u2019)\u00a0(1).\n(10) Article 28(1) TEU empowers the Council to adopt decisions laying down the means to be made available to the Union. The financial reference amount, for an initial 4-month period, for the common costs of the European Union military operation constitutes the best current estimate and is without prejudice to the final figures to be included in a budget to be approved in accordance with the rules laid down in ATHENA.\n(11) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Denmark does not, therefore, participate in the financing of this operation,", "main_body": ["Mission\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a view to underpinning the mandates of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 (2011), the Union shall, if requested by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), conduct in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy a military operation, hereinafter called \u2018EUFOR Libya\u2019, in order to support humanitarian assistance in the region.
