The design of such a Community logo requires a certain time period to be developed and to be made known to the public.\n(4) In order to avoid unnecessary financial and organisational burdens on operators, the compulsory use of the Community logo should be postponed for the time needed to create the new Community logo. This decision does not prevent operators from using, on a voluntary basis, the current logo defined in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The following paragraph shall be added to Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007:\n\u2018However, Article 24(1)(b) and (c) shall apply as from 1 July 2010.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
