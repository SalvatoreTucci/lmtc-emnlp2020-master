Per anhydrous hectolitre, add:\n(a) 125 grams of thiophene,\n(b) 0,8 grams of denatonium benzoate,\n(c) 3 grams of CI reactive red 24 (red colorant), solution at 25\u00a0% w/w,\n(d) 2 litres of methyl ethyl ketone.\nIn order to ensure the complete solubility of all the components, the denaturant mixture must be prepared in ethyl alcohol below 96\u00a0% by volume measured on the EC alcoholmeter.\nDenaturation is achieved by the substances listed at points (a), (b) and (d). Thiophene and denatonium benzoate alter the organoleptic characteristics of the product, making ingestion impossible, while methyl ethyl ketone, with a boiling point (79,6\u00a0\u00b0C) close to that of ethyl alcohol (78,9\u00a0\u00b0C), is difficult to eliminate except by non-economic techniques. This facilitates checks by the financial authorities to identify possible misuse.\nThe purpose of CI reactive red 24 is to give the product a characteristic red colour, which makes the purpose of the product immediately identifiable.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 31.10.1992, p. 21.
