Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The applicant sought for the authorisation of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine. The use of chelated forms may overcome some of the problems of absorption that occurs when other forms are used. A similar product is authorised with amino acids derived from soya protein. However, in this request for authorisation the trace elements are chelated with synthetic glycine and, therefore, needs a specific authorisation.\n(6) The applicant submitted a dossier in support of the use in feedingstuffs of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine.\n(7) The Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) to evaluate the relevant data supporting the application for authorisation. Following this request, the Authority has adopted on 29 November 2005 an opinion on the use in feedingstuffs of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine.\n(8) The opinion of the Authority shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine, should be authorised.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Compounds of trace elements\u2019, as specified in the Annex, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 March 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
