Laboratory  purposes are definied at this time to include equipment calibration; use as extraction solvents,  diluents, or carriers in chemical analysis; biochemical research; inert solvents used for chemical  reactions, as a carrier or laboratory chemical and for other critical analytical and laboratory  purposes. Production for laboratory and analytical purposes is authorized provided that these  laboratory and analytical chemicals shall contain only controlled substances manufactured to the  following purities:\n>TABLE>\n2.  These pure, controlled substances can be subsequently mixed by manufacturers, agents, or  distributors with other chemicals controlled or not controlled by the Montreal Protocol as is  customary for laboratory and analytical uses.\n3.  These high purity substances and mixtures containing controlled substances shall be supplied  only in re-closable containers or high pressure cylinders smaller than three litres or in 10  millilitre or smaller glass ampoules, marked clearly as substances that deplete the ozone layer,  restricted to laboratory use and analytical purposes and specifying that used or surplus substances  should be collected and recycled, if practical. The material should be destroyed if recycling is  not practical."}
