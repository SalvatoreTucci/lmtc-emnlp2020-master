whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\nWhereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\nWhereas florfenicol should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas gonadotrophin releasing hormone should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90; whereas by extrapolation of scientific data this classification into Annex II shall apply to all food-producing animals;\nWhereas moxidectin, should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 in order to allow for the establishment of the specificity of the analytical method against Doramectin for which a standard must become publicly available;\nWhereas ceftiofur should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 in order to allow for the completion of the validation of the analytical method for bovine and porcine liver and fat tissues; whereas surveillance of residues of ceftiofur is assured by monitoring bovine and porcine muscle and kidney tissues;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of Directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in the veterinary medicinal products sector,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 1994.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0See page 7 of this Official Journal.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nA.
