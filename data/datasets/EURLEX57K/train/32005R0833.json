Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI\u00a0SD\u00a0135) and alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) was provisionally authorised for the first time for weaned piglets, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2690/1999\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106), endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI\u00a0SD\u00a0135), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) and polygalacturonase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for weaned piglets, by Regulation (EC) No 2690/1999. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) and subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 2107) was provisionally authorised for the first time for weaned piglets, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs for fattening, by Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(10) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(11) The assessment of those applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(7).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in the Annex, are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
