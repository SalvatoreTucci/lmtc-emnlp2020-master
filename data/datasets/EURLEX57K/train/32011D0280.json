As the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators will continue the work undertaken by the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas within the framework of a more effective governance, it is therefore appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/796/EC.\n(4) In order to ensure that the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas can finalise several pending projects, the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas should be dissolved only as of 1 July 2011 so to ensure a smooth transition to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/796/EC is repealed.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2011."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 14.11.2003, p. 34.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 57.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 1."}
