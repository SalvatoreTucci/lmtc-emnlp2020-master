That communication was received on 14 April 2005.\n(4) The measures planned by the United Kingdom can be summarised as follows:\n\u2014 operators may be paid in euro the amounts laid down in Community legislation,\n\u2014 operators shall bear the full exchange-rate risk arising from subsequent conversion into sterling,\n\u2014 operators must make a standing commitment for a minimum of one year,\n\u2014 concerning the single payment and other direct payments as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001\u00a0(4), operators shall opt for payment in euro when they submit the single application as referred to in Article 11 (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(5),\n\u2014 concerning market support measures, operators must apply three months in advance of the operative event to be paid in euro; three months in advance of the operative event notice must also be given to withdraw from the arrangement; new payments in euro are then only possible after a one-year waiting period.\n(5) Those measures are in line with the objective fixed by Regulation (EC) No 2799/98, namely to prevent a systematic advantage resulting from the use of the euro rather than the national currency. They should therefore be approved.\n(6) For that reason, Decision 2001/121/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision,", "main_body": ["The measures communicated by the United Kingdom on 14\u00a0April 2005 concerning the payment in euro of expenditure resulting from legal instruments relating to the common agricultural policy listed in the Annex are hereby approved.", "Decision 2001/121/EC is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 36.
