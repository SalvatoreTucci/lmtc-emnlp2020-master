Article 9 thereof provides that a Member State which has a compulsory national control programme for one of the contagious diseases listed in Annex E(II) thereto, may submit its programme to the Commission for approval. That list includes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is the description of the most prominent clinical signs of the infection with the bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV1).\n(2) Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.\n(3) In addition, Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC provides that where a Member State considers that its territory or part thereof is free from one of the diseases listed in Annex E(II) to that Directive, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission. That Article also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.\n(4) Commission Decision 2004/558/EC\u00a0(2) approves the programmes for the control and eradication of BHV1 presented by the Member States listed in Annex I thereto for the regions listed in that Annex and for which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(5) In addition, Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC lists the regions of the Member States that are considered free of BHV1 and to which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(6) Belgium has submitted to the Commission a programme with the aim of eradicating BHV1 infection in the whole of its territory. That programme complies with the criteria set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. That programme also provides for rules for the national movement of bovine animals which are equivalent to those previously implemented in certain Member States or regions thereof, which were successful in eradicating the disease in those Member States or regions.\n(7) Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) All regions of Germany, with the exception of the Federal State of Bavaria, are currently listed in Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC. The Federal State of Bavaria is free of BHV1 and is therefore listed in Annex II to that Decision.\n(9) Germany has now submitted to the Commission supporting documentation for the Federal State of Thuringia to be considered free of BHV1 and for the additional guarantees in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(10) Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2004/558/EC are replaced by the text in Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p.\u00a01977/64.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2004/558/EC of 15 July 2004 implementing Council Directive 64/432/EEC as regards additional guarantees for intra-Community trade in bovine animals relating to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and the approval of the eradication programmes presented by certain Member States (OJ L\u00a0249, 23.7.2004, p.\u00a020).\nANNEX\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 2004/558/EC are replaced by the following:\nANNEX I\nMember States Regions of Member States to which the additional guarantees for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis apply in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC\nBelgium All regions\nCzech Republic All regions\nGermany All regions, except the Federal State of Bavaria and the Federal State of Thuringia\nItaly Region Friuli-Venezia Giulia\nANNEX II\nMember States Regions of Member States to which the additional guarantees for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis apply in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC\nDenmark All regions\nGermany The Federal State of Bavaria\nItaly The Autonomous Province of Bolzano\nAustria All regions\nFinland All regions\nSweden All regions"}
