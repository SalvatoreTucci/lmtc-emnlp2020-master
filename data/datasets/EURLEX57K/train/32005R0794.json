Experience shows that the transitional measures provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article should also be applied in some Member States in 2006.\n(2) The second subparagraph of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 provides that, by way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the Member States may allow the presence in nut orchards of trees other than nut trees within a limit corresponding to 10\u00a0% of the minimum number of nut trees per hectare laid down in paragraph 3 of that Article. Application of that provision has led to differences in interpretation. The scope of that provision should therefore be clarified, taking account of the special nature of nut orchards in the Member States, and specifying that the aforementioned 10\u00a0% limit applies to the minimum number of nut trees per hectare or the number of nut trees actually planted in the orchard in question.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Since Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 applies from 1\u00a0January 2005, the amendment concerned should also apply from that date.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following paragraph is added to Article 10:\n2. the second subparagraph of Article 15(1) is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "(2) shall apply from 1 January 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
