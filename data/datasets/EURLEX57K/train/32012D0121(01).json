The Commission expressed its initial views on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations in its Communication \u2018Facing the challenge of the safety of offshore oil and gas activities\u2019\u00a0(1) on 12 October 2010.\n(4) The risks of a major offshore oil or gas accident occurring in Union waters are not insignificant. Offshore oil and gas industries are established in a number of regions of the Union, and there are prospects for new regional developments in Union waters. Production of offshore oil and gas is a significant element in EU security of energy supply.\n(5) While the Union already has examples of excellence in national regulatory practices related to offshore oil and gas activities, levelling up of the implementation of the regulatory framework for offshore oil and gas operations, can further improve the safety of offshore activities.\n(6) The continuous exchange of experience, identification of best practices among regulatory authorities and the industry and improvement of implementation measures are being recognised as key aspects of a well functioning regulatory regime.\n(7) The value of collaboration between offshore authorities has been clearly established by the activities of the North Sea Offshore Authorities Forum and the International Regulators Forum. Building on those experiences, it is important to maximise the effectiveness of transfer of experience and knowledge across the Union through a formal Union-wide structure.\n(8) Based primarily on the activities of national regulators, the European Union Offshore Oil and Gas Authorities Group should involve in its activities experience from relevant stakeholders including relevant third countries. The Authorities Group should facilitate the transfer of knowledge among stakeholders and assist in the production of formal guidelines relating to best practices.\n(9) The objectives of offshore authorities collaborating on matters relating to preventing the occurrence of, and responding to offshore major accidents are also complementary to the objectives of the Standing Working Party of Mining and Other Extractive Industries established under Article 6 of Council Decision 2003/C 218/01 setting up an Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work, and complementary to the objectives of the said Committee.\n(10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the Authorities Group and their representatives should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission's rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom.\n(11) Personal data relating to the members of the Authorities Group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe European Union Offshore Oil and Gas Authorities Group (hereinafter the \u2018Authorities Group\u2019) is hereby set up.", "Task\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authorities Group shall serve primarily as a forum for the exchange of experiences and expertise between national authorities and the Commission.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activities of the Authorities Group may encompass, in coordination with activities of other relevant expert groups, all issues relating to major accident prevention and response in offshore oil and gas operations within the Union, as well as beyond its borders, where appropriate.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authorities Group shall discuss, assist and give its opinions to the Commission, either at the Commission's request or on its own initiative, in particular on the following issues:\n(a) identifying priorities for preparation of guidance documents, standards and best practices in the oil and gas sector;\n(b) preparing, or initiating and overseeing the preparation of, guidelines on the industry best practices;\n(c) in the interest of sharing experience, facilitating rapid information exchange between the Commission and national authorities, regarding e.g. the occurrence and causes of and responses to major incidents, and events which could have led to major accidents as well as, operational intelligence concerning drilling installations that intend to move between Member States;\n(d) promoting and facilitating consensus between the Commission and national authorities regarding the best regulatory practice;\n(e) promoting exchanges and secondment of staff between national authorities to increase their knowledge and experience;\n(f) exchanging information regarding the application of national and Union legislation and policies relevant to offshore oil and gas activities, including measures to prevent intentional unlawful acts against those activities, and assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of relevant Union acquis.", "Consultation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Article 2 the Commission may consult the Authorities Group on any matter relating to major hazards in offshore oil and gas prospecting, exploration and production.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authorities Group shall consult with other Commission Expert Groups where there are complementary interests to ensure that relevant matters are brought to the attention of the other groups, and to receive information of interest to the Authorities Group.", "Membership \u2014 Appointment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authorities Group shall be composed of Member States' authorities responsible for the regulatory oversight of offshore oil and gas activities and related policy issues.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States' authorities shall nominate their representatives.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The names of Member States' authorities shall be published in the Register of Commission expert groups and other similar entities (\u2018the Register\u2019).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data shall be collected, processed and published in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.", "Operation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authorities Group shall be chaired by a representative of the Commission who may appoint a co-chair.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In agreement with the Commission services, the Authorities Group may set up sub-groups to examine specific questions, such as the exchange of best practices, on the basis of appropriate terms of reference.
