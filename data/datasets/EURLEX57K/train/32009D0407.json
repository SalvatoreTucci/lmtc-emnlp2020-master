The financing requires, as a first step, a revision of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013 in accordance with points 21, 22, and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, so as to raise the ceiling for the year 2009 for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by an amount of EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 in current prices.\n(2) The increase of the ceiling for subheading 1a will be fully offset by decreasing the ceiling for commitment appropriations under heading 2 for the year 2009 by EUR\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000.\n(3) In order to keep an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments, the annual ceilings for payment appropriations will be adjusted.
