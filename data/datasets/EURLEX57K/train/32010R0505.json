Chapter II of that Annex sets out provisions concerning classification of production areas and monitoring of such areas.\n(3) Production areas are classified according to the level of faecal contamination. Filter feeders animals, as bivalve molluscs, can accumulate micro-organisms representing a risk for public health. This is the reason why the classification of production areas is based on the presence of certain microorganisms related to faecal contamination.\n(4) Marine gastropods are generally not filter feeding animals, consequently the risk to accumulate microorganisms related to faecal contamination should be considered as remote. Moreover, no epidemiological information has been reported to link the provisions for classification of production areas with risks for public health associated with not filter feeding marine gastropods.\n(5) Taking into account this scientific progress, such marine gastropods, which are not filter feeders, should be excluded from provisions on the classification of production areas.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004\u00a0is amended in accordance with the Annex\u00a0to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004\u00a0is amended as follows:\n\u2018CHAPTER III: OFFICIAL CONTROLS CONCERNING PECTINIDAE AND LIVE MARINE GASTROPODS NOT FILTER FEEDERS HARVESTED OUTSIDE CLASSIFIED PRODUCTION AREAS\nOfficial controls on pectinidae and live marine gastropods, which are not filter feeders, harvested outside classified production areas are to be carried out in fish auctions, dispatch centres and processing establishments.\nSuch official controls are to verify compliance with the health standards for live bivalve molluscs laid down in Annex III, Section VII, Chapter V, to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 as well as compliance with other requirements of Annex III, Section VII, Chapter IX to that Regulation.\u2019"}
