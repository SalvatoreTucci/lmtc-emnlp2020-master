Infective allantoic fluid from the lowest passage level available, preferably from the initial isolation without any selection, is diluted 101 in sterile isotonic saline.\n2. 0,1 ml diluted virus is injected intravenously into each of 10 six-week-old chickens (specific pathogen free birds should be used).\n3. Birds are examined at 24 hour intervals for 10 days.\n4. At each observation each bird is recorded normal (O), sick (1), severely sick (2) or dead (3).\n5. Record results and calculate index as shown in this example:\n/* Tables: see OJ */\nCHAPTER II   Newcastle disease  'Newcastle disease' means an infection of poultry caused by any avian strain of the paramyxovirus 1 with an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in one-day-old chicks greater than 0,7.\nThe ICPI has to be determined according to the following method:\nIntracerebral pathogenicity index text (ICPI)\n1. Infective freshly harvested allantoic fluid (HA titre must be greater than 24) is diluted 1: 10 in sterile isotonic saline (antibiotics must not be used).\n2. 0,05 ml of the diluted virus is injected intracerebrally into each 10 one-day-old chicks (i.e. 24 - 40 hours after hatching). The chicks should be hatched from eggs obtained from a specific pathogen-free flock.\n3. The birds are examined at intervals of 24 hours for eight days.\n4. At each observation each bird is scored: 0 = normal; 1 = sick; 2 = dead.\n5. The index is calculated as shown in the following example:\n/* Tables: see OJ */\nANNEX B\nCRITERIA FOR RECOGNISED VACCINES  1. General criteria\nA. Vaccines have to be registered by the competent authorities of the third country concerned before being allowed to be distributed and used. For this registration the competent authorities have to rely on a complete file containing data about efficacy  and innocuity; for imported vaccines the competent authorities can rely on data checked by the competent authorities of the country where the vaccine is produced, as far as these checks have been carried out in conformity with internationally accepted  standards.\nB. Furthermore importation or production and distribution of the vaccines have to be controlled by the competent authorities of the third country concerned.\nC. Before distribution is allowed, each batch of vaccines has to be tested on innocuity, in particular regarding attenuation or inactivation and absence of undesired contaminating agents, and on efficacy on behalf of the competent authorities.\n2. Specific criteria\nA. Live attenuated Newcastle disease vaccines shall be prepared from a Newcastle disease virus strain for which the master seed has been tested and shown to have an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of:\neither\n(i) less than 0,4 if not less than 107 EID50 are administered to each bird in the ICPI test;\nor\n(ii) less than 0,5 if not less than 108 EID50 are administered to each bird in the ICPI test.\nB. Inactivated Newcastle disease vaccines shall be prepared form a Newcastle disease virus strain with an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in one-day-old chicks of less than 0,7 if not less than 108 EID50 are administered to each bird in the  ICPI test.\nANNEX C\nMINIMAL MEASURES TO BE TAKEN WHEN SANITARY SLAUGHTER IS PRACTISED TO ELIMINATE OUTBREAKS OF AVIAN INFLUENZA OR NEWCASTLE DISEASE  1. In case of suspicion the holding concerned shall be placed under official supervision. This shall in particular mean  that:\n(a) all necessary samples shall be taken without delay and sent to a laboratory approved by the competent authorities for diagnosis;\n(b) a record shall be made of all categories of poultry kept on the holding showing number of dead and diseased animals; this record shall be kept up-to-date and should be checked at each official visit;\n(c) all poultry shall be kept isolated and, whenever possible, in their living quarters;\n(d) no poultry is allowed to enter or to leave the holding;\n(e) all movements of persons, vehicles, materials etc. onto and from the holding shall be subject to official authorization;\n(f) table eggs can leave the holding after adequate disinfection or can be sent directly to an installation where they receive an adequate heat treatment;\n(g) appropriate means of disinfection have to be used at the entrances of buildings housing poultry and of the holding itself;\n(h) an epizootiological inquiry has to be carried out to discover the source of infection and its possible spread;\n(i) possibly infected contact premises, i. e. these known from the inquiry meant in point (g) have to be put also under official surveillance.\n2. As soon as the presence of the disease is officially confirmed on a holding, the following measures shall be taken in addition of those mentioned under point 1:\n(a) all poultry on the holding shall be killed on the spot without any delay; their carcasses and eggs shall be destroyed; these operations have to be carried out in a way which minimizes the risk of spreading disease;\n(b) any substance or waste liable to be contaminated shall be destroyed or treated in a way to ensure destruction of any virus present;\n(c) the meat of poultry slaughtered during the presumed incubation period should be traced and destroyed;\n(d) hatching eggs laid during the presumed incubation period should be traced and destroyed; poultry which hatched from such eggs shall be placed under official surveillance;\n(e) after carrying out killing and destruction operations the premises shall be thoroughly cleansed and desinfected;\n(f) no poultry shall be reintroduced onto the holding until at least 21 days after the end of the disinfection operations.\n3. The operations mentioned in point 2 may be restricted to parts of holdings which form an epizootiological unit as far as the necessary guarantees exist to avoid spread of the disease to the non-infected units of the holding.\n4. Around confirmed outbreaks of disease a protection zone with a minimum radius of 3 km and a surveillance zone with a minimum radius of 10 km shall be implemented. In these zones stand-still measures and controlled movements of poultry shall be in  force until at least 21 days after the end of the disinfection operations on the infected holding. Before lifting the measures in these zones the authorities shall carry out the necessary inquiries and sampling of the poultry holdings to confirm that  disease is no longer present in the region concerned.\n5. The operations mentioned in this Annex have to be carried out by or under the supervision of the official veterinary authorities.\nANNEX D\nADDITIONAL GUARANTEES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH CERTIFICATE FOR IMPORT OF FRESH POULTRY MEAT INTO THE COMMUNITY FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHERE ARTICLE 4 (3) OF DECISION 93/342/EEC APPLIES  The slaughter poultry flock from which the meat is issued,\n(a) (i) either has not been vaccinated with vaccines against Newcastle disease which do not fulfil the specific requirements of Annex B point 2 of Decision 93/342/EEC (1)();\n(ii) or has been vaccinated with vaccines which do not fulfil the specific requirements of Annex B point 2 of Decision 93/342/EEC, not less than 30 days before slaughter (*); and\n(b) has undergone at slaughter, on the basis of an at random sample of cloacal swabs of at least 60 birds of each flock concerned, a virus isolation test for Newcastle disease in which no avian paramyxoviruses with an intracerebral pathogenicity index  (ICPI) of more than 0,4 have been found; and\n(c) has not been in contact during the period of 30 days preceding slaughter with poultry which do not fulfil the guarantees mentioned under (a) and (b).\n(1)() Delete the unnecessary reference.\nANNEX E\nADDITIONAL GUARANTEES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH CERTIFICATE FOR IMPORT OF LIVE POULTRY OR HATCHING EGGS INTO THE COMMUNITY FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHERE ARTICLE 4 (4) OF DECISION 93/342/EEC APPLIES  Although the use of vaccines against Newcastle  disease which do not fulfil the specific requirements of point 2 of Annex B of Decision 93/342/EEC, is not prohibited in ....................
