This must be done at least once a month by the appointed project leader or a duly authorised senior member of the beneficiary's staff.\n2.

Travel to the workshop venue\nEligible expenses for travel by train are those corresponding to a first-class ticket by the shortest route.\nAir travel reimbursement is based on economy class at the cheapest possible fare, taking account of the constraints of the journey. When the conditions of travel allow, reduced-rate fares (APEX, PEX, Excursion, etc.) are to be applied. However, if the journey is separated from a weekend by no more than 24 hours, additional daily subsistence allowances may be granted in order to qualify for a reduced-rate fare, provided this results in an overall saving (travel expenses + allowances).\nIf participants use their private car instead of travelling by air and/or train, travel expenses are to be reimbursed on the basis of the first-class rail fare by the shortest route, excluding any supplements and applying the cheapest fare. If two or more persons use the same car, only the owner of the car is to be entitled to reimbursement of travel expenses. Parking costs or tolls incurred in using a private car are not to be refunded. Participants using their private car remain fully liable for any accidents to their car or caused by their car to third parties. The workshop organiser cannot under any circumstances accept any requests for compensation, irrespective of the reasons for which participants used their private car.\nAny negligence on the part of a participant (e.g. loss of vouchers), and its financial consequences, remains the participant's own responsibility.\n2. Allowances\nThe following allowances applicable from 24 March 1999 (date of publication of Regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) No 620/1999, OJ L 78, 24.3.1999) are to be adjusted in line with the allowances in force on the date of the workshop. In justified cases, the daily allowance can be increased with the difference between the room cost (breakfast excluded) and 50 % of this daily allowance.\n>TABLE>\nANNEX V\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2004027EN.001402.TIF\">"}
