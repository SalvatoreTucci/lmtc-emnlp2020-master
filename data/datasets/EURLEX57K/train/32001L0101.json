This definition covers all parts of animals which are fit for human consumption. It does not correspond, however, to the consumer's perception of meat and does not inform the consumer as to the real nature of the product designated by the term \"meat\".\n(2) Several Member States have adopted a definition of the term \"meat\" for the labelling of products that contain meat. However, the diversity of the national approaches has led to difficulties which adversely affect the operation of the internal market and make it necessary to prepare a harmonised definition.\n(3) Annex I to Directive 2000/13/EC defines certain categories of ingredients which may be designated by the name of the category rather than by the specific name of the ingredient considered for inclusion in the list of ingredients.\n(4) The category \"meat\" is not defined in that Annex, which creates difficulties in implementing Directive 2000/13/EC, notably as regards indication of the list of ingredients and the quantitative declaration of the ingredients. There is a need, therefore, for a harmonised definition corresponding to the category name \"... meat\" in order to apply Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(5) In view of the right of consumers to be well and clearly informed so that they can choose what to eat and assess differences in selling prices, the name of the species used should be an element of the reference to the category name.\n(6) The definition applies exclusively to the labelling of products which contain meat as an ingredient. It does not apply, therefore, to the labelling of meat cuts and anatomical parts which are sold without further processing.\n(7) Mechanically recovered meat differs significantly from \"meat\" as perceived by consumers. It should therefore be excluded from the scope of the definition.\n(8) Consequently, it should be designated by its specific name, \"mechanically recovered meat\", and by the name of the species, in compliance with the rule set out in Article 6(6) of Directive 2000/13/EC. This labelling rule applies to the products covered by the Community definition of \"mechanically recovered meat\".\n(9) Other animal parts which are fit for human consumption but which do not fall under the definition of the term \"meat\" for labelling purposes should also be designated by their specific name in accordance with the same principle.\n(10) In order to determine the \"meat\" content of products in a uniform manner, maximum limits should be established for the fat and connective tissue content of products which may be designated by the category name \"... meat\". These limits are without prejudice to the specific provisions governing minced meat and meat preparations laid down in Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations(4).\n(11) If these maximum limits are exceeded, but all other criteria for the definition of \"meat\" are satisfied, the \"... meat\" content should be adjusted downwards accordingly and the list of ingredients should mention, in addition to the term \"... meat\", the presence of fat and/or connective tissue.\n(12) It also appears necessary to establish a harmonised method for determining the connective tissue content.\n(13) Directive 2000/13/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Food,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2000/13/EC is amended in accordance with the text set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
