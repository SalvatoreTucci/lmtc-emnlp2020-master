whereas those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and in Article  1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in  which the premium for goatmeat is granted  (7), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86  (8);\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and to enable an advance payment  to be made to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers, the foreseeable loss of income should be estimated  in the light of the foreseeable trend in market prices;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the amount of the premium per  ewe for producers of heavy lambs is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in the  second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that Article by a coefficient expressing the annual average  production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase  weight; whereas the coefficient for 1995 has not yet been fixed in view of the lack of full  Community statistics; whereas, pending the fixing of that coefficient, a provisional coefficient  should be used; whereas Article 5 (3) of that Regulation also fixes the amount per ewe for  producers of light lambs and per female of the caprine species and at 80  % of the premium per ewe  for producers of heavy lambs;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the premium must be reduced by the  impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article;

whereas those measures entail the grant of a  supplement to the ewe premium to producers of light lambs and she-goats on the same conditions as  those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89;  whereas those conditions provide that Spain is authorized to pay an advance on the said  supplementary premium;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["A difference is hereby estimated between the basic price, reduced by  the impact of the coefficient laid down in Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, and the  foreseeable market price during 1995 is ECU 162,785 per 100 kilograms.", "1.
