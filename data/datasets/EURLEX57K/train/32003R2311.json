This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the Swedish intervention agency available on the internal market. The period of presentation of the offers for the last partial invitation to tender under Regulation (EC) No 1965/2003(3) having expired on 18 December 2003, it is advisable to open a new standing invitation to tender.\n(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(6) When the Swedish intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The Swedish intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 48048 tonnes of barley held by it.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding that Regulation:\n(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.", "Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security is set at EUR 10 per tonne.", "1.
