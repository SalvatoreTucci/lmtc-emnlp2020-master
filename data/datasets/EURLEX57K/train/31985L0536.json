DEFINITIONS\nMethanol, ethanol, iso-propyl alcohol (propan-2-o1), butyl alcohol (butan-1-ol), secondary butyl alcohol (butan-2-ol), tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA 2-methyl propan-2-ol), iso-butyl alcohol (2-methyl-1-propanol), other mono-alcohols with a final distillation point no higher than the final distillation point laid down in national specifications or, where these do not exist, in industrial specifications for motor fuels, and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE tert-butoxymethane) and tertiary amyl-methyl ether (TAME 2-methoxy-2-methyl butane), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE 2-ethoxy-2-methyl propane) and other ethers (R1-O-R2) with a final distillation point no higher than the final distillation point laid down in national specifications or, where these do not exist, in industrial specifications for motor fuels, whose molecules containing five or more carbon atoms are currently acceptable organic oxygenates for use as substitute fuel components and/or stabilizing agents for motor fuel. Mixtures of these compounds are also acceptable.\nThe term 'stabilizing agents' refers to certain of the substances referred to in the first sub-paragraph added to assist in the prevention of phase separation of petrol/substitute fuel component blends.\nII. COMPOSITION OF BLENDS\nIn accordance with Article 1, Member States must permit, for the proportions by volume of organic oxygenate compounds in fuel blends, those not exceeding limits indicated in column A.\nMember States may authorize proportions of organic oxygenate compounds higher than those limits. The requirement for marking at the pumps prescribed by Article 3 applies to proportions of organic oxygenate compounds higher than the limits indicated in column B.\n1.2.3 //  //  //  //  // A   // B   //    //   //  // Methanol, suitable stabilizing agents must be added (1)  // 3 % vol   // 3 % vol   // Ethanol, stabilizing agents may be necessary (1)   // 5 % vol   // 5 % vol   // Iso-propyl alcohol   // 5 % vol   // 10 % vol   // TBA   // 7 % vol   // 7 % vol   // Iso-butyl alcohol   // 7 % vol   // 10 % vol  // Ethers containing five or more carbon atoms per molecule (1)   // 10 % vol   // 15 % vol   // Other organic oxygenates defined in section 1   // 7 % vol   // 10 % vol   // Mixture of any organic oxygenates (2) defined in section 1   // 2,5 % oxygen weight, not exceeding the individual limits fixed above for each component  // 3,7 % oxygen weight, not exceeding the individual limits fixed above for each component\n//  //  // (1) In accordance with national specifications or, where these do not exist, industrial specifications.\n(2) Acetone is authorized up to 0,8 % by volume when it is present as a by-product of the manufacture of certain organic oxygenate compounds.\nThe use of components other than those specified in Section I as additives at concentrations below 0,5 % in total is not affected by this Directive.\nIII. REQUIREMENTS\nTechnical specifications for current motor fuels are defined at present in Member States by national standards or, where these do not exist, by industrial specifications.\nPetrol blended with organic oxygenate compounds will have to conform with the technical specifications that apply to the types of fuels that the blends are intended to replace.\nIn addition, specifications relating to properties that are peculiar to blends of petrol and organic oxygenate compounds (for example, water tolerance, hygroscopicity, material compatibility and detrimental impurities, including organic acid content, copper content, etc.) will be considered and may be laid down for these blends by the appropriate standards organizations or, where these do not exist, by industrial organizations."}
