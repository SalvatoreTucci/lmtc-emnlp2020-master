The following shall be inserted after the first subparagraph of Article 4 (3):\n'However, the following may also be taken into consideration:\n- in Spain, in addition to the marketing years referred to in the first subparagraph, the 1992/93 marketing year, provided that the total eligible area does not exceed 550 000 hectares,\n- in Portugal, in addition to the 1991/92 marketing year, the 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91 marketing years for the areas sown to durum wheat, provided that the total eligible area does not exceed 30 000 hectares.'\n2.
