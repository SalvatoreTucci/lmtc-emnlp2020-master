The international standards listed in Annex V were those available at the time of adoption of that Directive.\n(3) Since the publication of Directive 2000/60/EC, a number of new standards have been published by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), some of them jointly with the International Standards Organisation, addressing biological sampling of phytoplankton, macrophytes and phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates, fish and hydromorphological characteristics. Those standards should be added to Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC.\n(4) As a result of the continued process of development of new standards and update of existing ones, some of the standards listed in Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC are no longer published by CEN Member Bodies and should therefore be removed.\n(5) Two standards (EN ISO 8689-1:1999 and EN ISO 8689-2:1999 9) listed in Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC addressed biological classification and not monitoring; they have been taken into account subsequently when developing protocols for setting class boundaries under the Common Implementation Strategy related to the Directive and can now be removed.\n(6) Directive 2000/60/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 21(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 May 2016 at the latest.
