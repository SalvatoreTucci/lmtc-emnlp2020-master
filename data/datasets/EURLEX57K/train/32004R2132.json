It is, however, sufficient to establish the Community producer price for only one of the products listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 since the prices for the other products may be calculated by means of the conversion factors established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3510/82\u00a0(2).\n(5) On the basis of the criteria laid down in the first and second indent of Article 18(2) and in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the Community producer price for the 2005 fishing year should be adjusted.\n(6) Given the urgency of the matter, it is important to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in paragraph 1(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on the European Union,", "main_body": ["For the fishing year from 1 January to 31 December 2005, the guide prices as provided for in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be as set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "For the fishing year from 1 January to 31 December 2005, the Community producer prices as provided for in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be as set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.
