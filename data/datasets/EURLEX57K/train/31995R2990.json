Provided an amount is fixed for the purpose in paragraph 2, in the event of a  reduction in an agricultural conversion rate as referred to in Article 1, the Member State affected  may make compensatory payments to farmers in three successive tranches lasting twelve months each,  starting with the month following the relevant reduction in the agricultural conversion rate. These  compensatory payments shall not take the form of aid linked to production during a stipulated  period prior to introduction of the compensation scheme; they shall not favour any particular type  of production or be dependent on production subsequent to the period stipulated.\n2.  In the case of Sweden the overall amount of compensation allocated for the first 12-month  tranche may not exceed ECU 10,8 million multiplied by the fall in the agricultural conversion rate  referred to in Article 1 expressed as a percentage and reduced, in the case of the first  appreciable reduction, by 1,564 points if the reduction occurs before 13 January 1996 or by 1,043  points if it occurs thereafter.\nIn the case of Finland the overall amount of compensation allocated for the first 12-month tranche  may not exceed ECU 14,6 million multiplied by the fall in the agricultrual conversion rate referred  to in Article 1 expressed as a percentage and reduced, in the case of the first appreciable  reduction, by 1,119 points if the reduction occurs before 21 January 1996 or by 0,746 points if it  occurs thereafter.\nThe amounts paid out under the second and third tranches shall be reduced, vis-\u00e0-vis the previous  tranche, by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche.\n3.  The Community contribution to financing these compensatory payments shall be 50  % of the  amounts that may be paid out.\nFor the purposes of the financing of the common agricultural policy, this contribution shall be  considered as forming part of the assistance designed to regularize agricultural markets. The  Member State may withdraw from national participation in financing the aid.\n4.  The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12 of Regulation  (EEC) No 3813/92, adopt detailed rules for applying this Article and in particular, in cases where  the Member State does not participate in financing the aid, lay down the conditions for paying that  aid.", "1.  In cases as referred to in Article 1, the agricultural conversion rates applicable,  on the date of the appreciable reduction, to the amounts referred to in Article 7 of Regulation  (EEC) No 3813/92 shall remain unchanged until 1 January 1999.\n2.  Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 shall not apply to the reductions in  agricultural conversion rates referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation.", "Before the end of the third period during which the compensation is granted, the  Commission shall examine the effects on agricultural income of the reductions in agricultural  conversion rates as referred to in Article 1.\nWhere it is established that income losses are likely to continue, the Commission may, in  accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92, extend the  possibility of granting compensation as provided for in Article 2 of this Regulation by a maximum  of 2 additional 12-month tranches, the maximum amount per tranche being equal to that granted in  the third tranche.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official  Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 1995.\nFor the Council The President L.
