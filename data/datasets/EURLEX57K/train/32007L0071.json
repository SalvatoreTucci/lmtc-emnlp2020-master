The provisions of the Directive as regards sewage should be seen in connection with Marpol Annex IV Regulations which provide, under specific conditions, for the possibility to discharge sewage at sea. This should apply without prejudice to more stringent delivery requirements for ships adopted in accordance with international law.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships set up by Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Annex II of Directive 2000/59/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 June 2009 at the latest.
