Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(7) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(8) By a letter of 12 October 2011 to the Commission, the CPME formally withdrew its complaint.\n(9) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) In this respect it is noted that the Commission did not identify any reason to indicate that termination would not be in the Union interest, nor was any such reason raised by interested parties. Therefore, the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment.\n(11) Some interested parties expressed support for the termination of the proceeding. Other interested parties, although supporting the termination of the proceeding, requested a disclosure of the findings of the investigation.\n(12) It is noted in this regard that the Commission did not reach a conclusion on its findings and is therefore not in a position to disclose data gathered prior to the withdrawal of the complaint.\n(13) In view of the above, it is concluded that there are no compelling reasons against terminating this proceeding.\n(14) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) originating in Oman and Saudi Arabia should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of polyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number of 78\u00a0ml/g or higher, according to the ISO Standard 1628-5, originating in Oman and Saudi Arabia, currently falling within CN code 3907\u00a060\u00a020, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 49, 16.2.2011, p. 16.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 49, 16.2.2011, p. 21."}
