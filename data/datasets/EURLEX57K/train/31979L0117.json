Plant protection products\nActive substances and preparations containing one or more active substances intended:\n1.1. to destroy organisms harmful to plants or plant products or to protect them from such organisms, in so far as such substances or preparations are not defined in the following provisions;\n1.2. to, influence the life processes of plants, other than as a nutrient;\n1.3. to preserve plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special Council or Commission provisions on preservatives;\n1.4. to destroy undesired plants; or\n1.5. to destroy parts of plants or to prevent undesired growth of plants.\n2.

Animals\nAnimals belonging to species normally nourished and kept or consumed by man.\n9. Placing on the market\nAny transfer of possession, whether in return for payment or free of charge.\n10. Environment\nThe relationship of human beings with water, air, land and all biological forms.", "Member States shall ensure that plant protection products containing one or more of the active substances listed in the Annex may be neither placed on the market nor used.\nThe first paragraph shall not apply to plant protection products which contain negligible impurities because of the nature of their manufacturing process, provided that they have no harmful effects on human beings, animals or the environment.", "1.

The Commission shall examine at least every two years whether and to what extent the second column of the Annex should be amended.\n5. All amendments to the Annex shall be made by reason of the development of scientific and technical knowledge.\n6. An active substance shall be included in the Annex if, even when properly applied for the purpose intended, its use gives rise or is likely to give rise to:\n(a) harmful effects on human or animal health;\n(b) unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.", "1. If it appears necessary, because of an unforeseeable danger threatening plant production which cannot be contained by other means, to use in a Member State a plant protection product containing one or more of the active substances listed in the Annex, the Member State in question may permit the placing on the market and the use of such product for a maximum period of 120 days. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission of its action.\n2.
