whereas those areas are defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 (3); whereas Article 5 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the possibility of the granting of premiums to producers of female sheep of certain mountain breeds other than eligible ewes in certain areas; whereas the sheep and the areas in question are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down the general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3524/85 (5);\nWhereas pursuant to Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 and to enable an advance payment to be made to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers operating in less-favoured agricultural areas, the foreseeable loss of income should be estimated in the light of the foreseeable trend in market prices;\nWhereas under Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 the amount of the premium per ewe and per region is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in Article 5 (2) by a coefficient expressing for each region the normal annual average production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase weight; whereas, however, for region 5 this loss of income must be reduced by the weighted average of the variable premiums actually granted and the foreseeable premiums for the remainder of the 1986 marketing year, such average being obtained in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 (6); whereas also under Article 5 (3) the amount of the premium for female goat is fixed at 80 % of the premium per ewe; whereas under Article 5 (9) the amount of the premim for female sheep other than eligible ewes is also fixed at 80 % of the premium per ewe;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86 (6) accordingly determined the estimated loss of income and the estimated level of the premium payable per ewe and per female goat for the 1986 marketing year, and authorized certain Member States to pay an advance; whereas, in the light of the present situation on the Community market and in particular the collapse of market prices, the estimated loss of income and the estimated level of the premium payable per ewe and per female goat for the 1986 marketing year should be redetermined; whereas, by way of derogation from Article 4 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3007/84 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1514/86 (8), the advance for the 1986 marketing year should therefore be 50 % of the estimated foreseeable premium; whereas, in accordance with Article 4 (3) of the said Regulation, the advance is paid only where it is not less than one ECU;\nWhereas, in Member States which have already paid the advance referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86, the amount payable to producers who have received the advance is the difference between the advance payable under this Regulation and that referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3007/84, Member States, are, under Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86, prevented from paying an advance on the premium referred to in Article 5 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80; whereas, however, given the exceptional market situation obtaining in region 1 following the Chernobyl accident and the fact that large numbers of lambs have been kept on holdings instead of being slaughtered, Greece and Italy should, by way of derogation from the said Article 4 (4), be authorized to pay an advance on the premium;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 2545/86 should be repealed;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["A difference is hereby found between the basic price and the foreseeable market price during the 1986 marketing year for the following regions:\n1.2 // Region   // Difference in ECU/100 kg   // 2   // 80,32   // 3   // 71,32   // 4   // 133,32   // 5   // 142,32   // 6  // 117,32   // 7   // 57,32", "1.
