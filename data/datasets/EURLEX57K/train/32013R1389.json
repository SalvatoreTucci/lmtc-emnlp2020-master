The new Protocol grants EU vessels fishing opportunities in waters in which the Republic of Madagascar exercises its sovereignty or jurisdiction with regard to fishing. The allocation of fishing opportunities granted to the Union under the new Protocol was established by Council Regulation 1258/2012\u00a0(2).\n(3) On 26 September 2012, the Joint Committee, provided for in the Partnership Agreement, examined the issue of sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which sharks are the subject of IOTC Resolution 05/05 and the fishing of which is authorised within the framework of the Partnership Agreement. It concluded, on the basis of records of catches for the period 2007-2011 of surface longliners authorised to fish under the previous protocol to the Partnership Agreement, as validated by the relevant scientific institutes, that it would be appropriate to limit shark catches by such vessels to a maximum of 200 tonnes annually from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2014, thereby freezing the fishing pressure on these shark stocks in line with the recommendation issued by the IOTC Scientific Committee.\n(4) In the light of discussions within the Joint Committee, shark catches should be limited and allocated among the Member States for the period of application of the new Protocol. Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 should therefore be amended.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 20(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002\u00a0(3), the Member States whose vessels are authorised to fish under Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 may exchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them with respect to sharks.\n(6) This Regulation should apply from 1 January 2014,", "main_body": ["The following paragraph is added in Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012:\n\u20181a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fishing opportunities for sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission by surface longliners are hereby set at 200 tonnes per year.
