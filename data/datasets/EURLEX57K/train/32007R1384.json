Regulation (EC) No 2497/96 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(2) The tariff quotas should be administered on the basis of import licences.

In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(5) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the poultrymeat sector, clear conditions should be laid down as regards access for operators to the tariff quota scheme.\n(6) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.\n(7) In the interests of the operators, the Commission should determine the quantities that have not been applied for, which will be added to the next quota subperiod in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quotas in Annex I are opened by Regulation (EC) No 2398/96 for the import of poultrymeat products under the CN codes indicated therein.\nThe tariff quotas shall be open on an annual basis for the period from 1 January to 31 December.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quotas referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable reduction in customs duty, the serial numbers and the group numbers shall be as set out in Annex I.", "The provisions of Regulations (EC) No 1291/2000 and (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "The quantity fixed for the annual quota period for each serial number shall be divided among four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June;\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, applicants for import licences shall, when submitting the first application for a given tariff quota period, provide proof that they imported or exported at least 50 tonnes of products covered by Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 in each of the two periods referred to in that Article 5.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications shall mention only one of the serial numbers indicated in Annex I.
