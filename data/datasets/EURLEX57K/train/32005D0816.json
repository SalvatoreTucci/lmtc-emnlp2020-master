Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on the Republic of Estonia\u2019s total VAT resources base. The Republic of Estonia is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions listed in Annex F to the sixth Directive. The Republic of Estonia should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT base using approximate estimates in accordance with the second indent of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89.\n(4) The Advisory Committee on Own Resources has approved the report recording the opinions of its members on this Decision,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base from 1 May 2004, the Republic of Estonia is authorised to use approximate estimates in respect of the following category of transactions referred to in Annex F to the sixth Directive:\n1.
