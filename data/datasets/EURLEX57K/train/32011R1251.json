The Agreement should be applied to any procurement contract with a value that reaches or exceeds the amounts (hereinafter referred to as \u2018thresholds\u2019) set in the Agreement and expressed as special drawing rights.\n(2) One of the objectives of Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC is to allow the contracting entities and the contracting authorities which apply those Directives to comply at the same time with the obligations laid down in the Agreement. To achieve this, the thresholds laid down by those Directives for public contracts which are also covered by the Agreement should be aligned in order to ensure that they correspond to the euro equivalents, rounded down to the nearest thousand, of the thresholds set out in the Agreement.\n(3) For reasons of coherence, it is appropriate to align also those thresholds in Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC which are not covered by the Agreement. At the same time, the thresholds laid down by Directive 2009/81/EC should be aligned to the revised thresholds laid down in Article 16 of Directive 2004/17/EC.\n(4) Directives 2004/17/EC, 2004/18/EC and 2009/81/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts,", "main_body": ["Directive 2004/17/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 16 is amended as follows:\n(a) in point (a), the amount \u2018EUR 387\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 400\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) in point (b), the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n(2) Article 61 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1, the amount \u2018EUR 387\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 400\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) in paragraph 2, the amount \u2018EUR 387\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 400\u00a0000\u2019.", "Directive 2004/18/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 7 is amended as follows:\n(a) in point (a), the amount \u2018EUR 125\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 130\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) in point (b), the amount \u2018EUR 193\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 200\u00a0000\u2019;\n(c) in point (c), the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n(2) the first paragraph of Article 8 is amended as follows:\n(a) in point (a), the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) in point (b), the amount \u2018EUR 193\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 200\u00a0000\u2019;\n(3) in Article 56, the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n(4) in the first subparagraph of Article 63(1), the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019;\n(5) Article 67(1) is amended as follows:\n(a) in point (a), the amount \u2018EUR 125\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 130\u00a0000\u2019;\n(b) in point (b), the amount \u2018EUR 193\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 200\u00a0000\u2019;\n(c) in point (c), the amount \u2018EUR 193\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 200\u00a0000\u2019.", "Article 8 of Directive 2009/81/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in point (a), the amount \u2018EUR 387\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 400\u00a0000\u2019;\n(2) in point (b), the amount \u2018EUR 4\u00a0845\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 1 January 2012\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 114.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 216, 20.8.2009, p. 76.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 23.12.1994, p. 1."}
