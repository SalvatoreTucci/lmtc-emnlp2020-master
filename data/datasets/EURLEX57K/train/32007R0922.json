Those Articles also provide for the amounts awarded to the Member States to be reduced for the following financial year if the expenditure incurred by them on 30 June is less than 75\u00a0% of their initial allocations.\n(4) Bulgaria and Romania, for which the 2006/2007 wine year is the first year of application of the restructuring and conversion scheme, are not able to use up most of their initial allocation by 30 June. Application of Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 would result in excessive reductions in the appropriations available to those Member States for restructuring and conversion in the current and the next financial year.\n(5) Therefore, on a transitional basis, for the 2006/2007 wine year, these excessive reductions are to be avoided, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, by allowing Bulgaria and Romania to pay out, by the end of the current financial year, 90\u00a0% of their initial allocation for the 2006/2007 wine year and by exempting them from the reduction of their initial allocation in the subsequent wine year.\n(6) A similar provision was introduced in 2001 and in 2005 when the vineyard restructuring and conversion scheme was first applied by the Member States concerned. As the inability of the Member States concerned to spend their initial allocation could also be due to the late publication of the decision providing for the initial allocations, the option of using up these allocations must be fixed at the same high level as in 2005.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 16(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 and as concerns the 2007 financial year, Bulgaria and Romania may apply to the Commission, not later than 10 July 2007, for a further contribution to expenditure in the 2007 financial year above that notified to the Commission under Article 16(1)(a) and (b) of that Regulation, and up to 90\u00a0% of the financial allocation awarded to them by Decision 2007/381/EC.
