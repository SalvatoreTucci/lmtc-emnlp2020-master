Land shall be considered as such if normal field work has been carried out on it with a view to production and the rice grown on it reached the ripening stage.", "For the purposes of this aid scheme, the areas sown and tilled shall be classified into the following categories on the basis of the cropping conditions and particularly the scale of the soil preparation work:\n(a) Category 1: Areas requiring very extensive work for the growing of rice on account particularly of the thickness of the layer of peat unsuitable for cultivation (thickness exceeding 1 metre);\n(b) Category 2: Areas requiring extensive soil preparation work (thickness of top layer between 0,3 and 1 metre);\n(c) Category 3: Areas not requiring extensive work (thickness of layer less than 0,3 metre).", "The amount of the aid shall be fixed for rice grown on the areas in:\n(a) Category 1 at: ECU 1 052/ha;\n(b) Category 2 at: ECU 715/ha;\n(c) Category 3 at: ECU 348/ha.\nWithout prejudice to Article 6 (2), the amount of the aid shall be paid once only during the 1991/92 to 1995/96 marketing years for any one area under cultivation.", "1. Rice growers wishing to benefit from the aid shall submit each year, before a date be determined by the competent authorities, a declaration of the areas sown and harvested in respect of which the aid is applied for containing at least the  infomation mentioned in paragraph 2. This declaration shall constitute an application for aid.\n2. The declaration shall contain:\n(a) in respect of the grower:\n- name and forename,\n- mailing address;\n(b) in respect of the areas:\n- the total area of the land sown to rice and tilled,\n- a breakdown of that area by the categories defined in Article 3,\n- an accurate identification of those areas by means of a cadestral reference or a geographical reference in geographical documents approved by the competent national authorities,\n- where the area is not sown or tilled in its entirety, identification by means of a sketch map showing the location of the plots actually under rice.", "1.

Proof thereof shall be furnished within one month of the said reporting.\nThe Member State concerned shall inform the Commission forthwith of the cases it recognizes as cases of force majeure or of the natural disasters likely to justify the maintenance of eligibility to the aid.", "The conversion rate to be used for the payment of the aid shall be the agricultural conversion rate in force on 1 September preceding the submission of the declaration referred to in Article 5.", "1. The competent authorities of the Member State concerned shall take appropriate measures to verify the accuracy of the applications and their compliance with Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 and with this Regulation.

Where checks give rise to serious doubt as to the accuracy of a declaration or as to compliance with the Community provisions payments shall not, except in obvious cases of clerical error, be made until an on-the-spot inspection has established the  accuracy of the application or the compliance as mentioned.\n4. Where it is etablished that more than 5 % of the areas which were the subject of a declaration do not fulfil the conditions required for the grant of the aid the grower shall forego entitlement to the aid, and the national authorities shall inform  the Commission of such cases.", "0\nWhere aid has been wrongly paid, the competent authorities shall proceed to recuperate the amounts paid plus interest running from the date of actual payment of the aid to the date of actual recovery. The interest rate applied shall be that  in force under national law for similar recovery operations. The aid recovered shall be paid to the paying bodies or agencies and deducted by the latter from expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.", "1\nFrance shall take the necessary administrative steps to ensure the correct application of this Regulation.
