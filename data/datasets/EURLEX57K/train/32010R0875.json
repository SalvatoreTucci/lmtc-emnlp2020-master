This application is therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The person responsible for putting into circulation nicarbazin, CAS number 330-95-0, submitted an application for authorisation for 10 years, as a coccidiostat for chickens for fattening, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(6) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 March 2010\u00a0(3) that nicarbazin does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment, and that that additive is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens for fattening. Since p-nitroaniline, an impurity associated with nicarbazin, leads to possible residues of this substance, the Authority recommends that the content of that impurity be limited at the lowest achievable level.\n(7) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for the requested authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation, should be authorised. In view of the opinion of the Authority, it is, however, necessary to limit the content of the impurity p-nitroaniline. To give producers and users time to adapt, it is appropriate for this limitation to start to apply it three years after this Regulation becomes applicable.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 October 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(3):1551.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum residue limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and other medicinal substances\nAdditive composition\nActive substance\n1.
