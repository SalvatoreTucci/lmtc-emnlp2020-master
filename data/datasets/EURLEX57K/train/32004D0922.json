That Decision also sets out the proposed rate and maximum amount of the contribution for each programme.\n(2) Commission Decision 2003/848/EC of 28 November 2003 approving the TSE eradication and monitoring programmes of Member States and certain acceding Member States for 2004 and fixing the level of the Community\u2019s financial contribution\u00a0(3), approves the programmes listed in Decision 2003/746/EC and lays down the maximum amounts of the Community\u2019s financial contribution.\n(3) Decision 2003/848/EC provides for progress reports to be forwarded by the Member States to the Commission every month. An analysis of those reports indicates that certain Member States will not utilise their full allocation for 2004, while others will spend in excess of the allocated amount.\n(4) The Community\u2019s financial contribution to certain of those programmes therefore needs to be adjusted. It is appropriate to reallocate funding from programmes of Member States which are not using their full allocation to those that are exceeding it. The reallocation should be based on the most recent information on the expenditure actually incurred by the concerned Member States.\n(5) Decisions 2003/746/EC and 2003/848/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/746/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "Decision 2003/848/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4(2), \u2018EUR 745\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 383\u00a0000\u2019;\n2. in Article 6(2), \u2018EUR 21\u00a0733\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 24\u00a0735\u00a0000\u2019;\n3. in Article 8(2), \u2018EUR 6\u00a0283\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 6\u00a0401\u00a0000\u2019;\n4. in Article 10(2), \u2018EUR 4\u00a0028\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 4\u00a0346\u00a0000\u2019;\n5. in Article 11(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0675\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0789\u00a0000\u2019;\n6. in Article 12(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0012\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0177\u00a0000\u2019;\n7. in Article 15(2), \u2018EUR 7\u00a0726\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 4\u00a0269\u00a0000\u2019;\n8. in Article 17(2), \u2018EUR 103\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 159\u00a0000\u2019;\n9. in Article 19(2), \u2018EUR 353\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 399\u00a0000\u2019;\n10. in Article 21(2), \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0000\u2019;\n11. in Article 22(2), \u2018EUR 755\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 927\u00a0000\u2019;\n12. in Article 24(2), \u2018EUR 435\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 573\u00a0000\u2019;\n13. in Article 25(2), \u2018EUR 1\u00a0160\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 3\u00a0014\u00a0000\u2019;\n14. in Article 26(2), \u2018EUR 490\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0006\u00a0000\u2019;\n15. in Article 27(2), \u2018EUR 3\u00a0210\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 671\u00a0000\u2019;\n16. in Article 28(2), \u2018EUR 675\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 704\u00a0000\u2019;\n17. in Article 29(2), \u2018EUR 30\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u2019;\n18. in Article 30(2), \u2018EUR 255\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 275\u00a0000\u2019;\n19. in Article 31(2), \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 3\u00a0000\u2019;\n20. in Article 32(2), \u2018EUR 5\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 34\u00a0000\u2019;\n21. in Article 33(2), \u2018EUR 7\u00a0460\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 6\u00a0652\u00a0000\u2019;\n22. in Article 34(2), \u2018EUR 740\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR 1\u00a0360\u00a0000\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.9.1990, p. 19.
