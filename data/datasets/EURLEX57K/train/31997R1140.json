whereas the applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex I to the imports, expressed in value or volume terms, of each importer over the reference period;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the total applications submitted by traditional importers for products listed in Annex II to this Regulation amount to less than the portion of the quota set aside for them; whereas those applications should therefore be met in full;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex III to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them; whereas the applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex III to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 728/97;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the total applications submitted by non-traditional importers for products listed in Annex IV to this Regulation amount to less than the portion of the quota set aside for them;
