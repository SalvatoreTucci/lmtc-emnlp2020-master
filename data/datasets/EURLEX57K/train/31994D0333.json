Consequently, under Article 10 thereof the Commission must determine whether the measure is compatible with the objectives  and criteria laid down in the Decision and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII  By Decisions 90/634/ECSC (2) and 91/221/ECSC (3) the Commission authorized aid to the United Kingdom coal industry for the financial years 1987, 1988 and 1989 totalling \u00a36 153 million. Apart from covering operating losses, this aid served to write  off the losses in the value of fixed assets and to constitute provisions to cover compensation for hearing loss and for concessionary supplies of coal, smokeless fuel or, in certain cases, a payment in kind to mineworkers on retirement.\nAuthorization was given in view of the fact that these measures facilitated the process of restructuring, rationalization and modernizing the United Kingdom coal industry in conformity with the objectives specified in Article 2 (1) of Decision No  2064/86/ECSC. The measures helped to improve the competitiveness of the industry through the closure of production capacity that offered no prospects of long-term economic viability and through the introduction of new production techniques or new  equipment for capacity offering prospects of long-term economic viability.\nOn 25 March 1993, the United Kingdom published a White Paper on the prospects for coal. This document stresses the Government's commitment to make the United Kingdom coal industry fully competitive with imported coal and to privatize British Coal in the  near future.\nThe reduction in world market prices coupled with the absence of outlets for this coal in the European Union has resulted in the process of restructuring of the United Kingdom coal industry being intensified. A large number of underground mines have  therefore had to be closed, or production in them has been stopped and the installations have been mothballed.\nTo enable the restructuring process to form part of a rational coal-mining policy allowing certain pits the time necessary to increase their productivity and, from that position, to become competitive, the United Kingdom Government proposes to  constitute a provision not exceeding a total of \u00a3120 million to cover the operating losses of those pits.\nThis aid should temporarily enable these pits to find a market among power stations for the disposal of their production. In the absence of this aid, these pits would be condemned to closing in the short term, which would increase the severity of the  social and regional problems related to the decline of this industry.\nIII  The aid to cover the operating losses must be considered with regard to the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, in particular those specified in Article 2 (1). The fact that the aid forms part of a clearly defined restructuring plan aimed at  closing down production units that offer no prospects of economic viability or rationalizing installations to make them competitive in terms of production with imported coal and the temporary nature of the aid means that it is compatible with the  provisions of the Decision.\nThe aid planned will not, according to the United Kingdom's notification, exceed the difference, for any quantity contracted, between the foreseeable average cost and the foreseeable average return per tonne and therefore complies with Article 3 (1) of  the Decision.\nThe Commission is taking account, as provided for in Article 10 (4) of the Decision, in its assessment of the measure and the restructuring programme submitted to it, of the special situation of the United Kingdom coal industry as regards the objective  of making the industry competitive with imported coal.\nThis aid will help to improve the competitiveness of the Community coal industry and to resolve the social and regional problems related to its development in conformity with the first and third indents of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.\nThe United Kingdom will ensure that the aid does not lead to any discrimination, within the meaning of Article 4 (b) of the ECSC Treaty, between producers, between purchasers or between consumers.\nWith regard to the constitution of a provision, the United Kingdom will inform the Commission each month, for monitoring purposes, of the amounts actually paid, the quantities covered and the beneficiary undertakings.\nIV  In the light of the above, and on the basis of the information supplied by the United Kingdom, the aid planned for the current production of the coal industry is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and with the proper  functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision covers the period until 31 December 1993, in conformity with Decision No 2064/86/ECSC. Should the United Kingdom decide to grant aid after this date, it shall notify this to the Commission in accordance with Commission Decision No  3632/93/ECSC (4).\nThis Decision does not prejudice the compatibility of any contracts which might be concluded between coal and electricity producers, with the provisions of the Treaties,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized to constitute a provision for the year 1993 of \u00a3120 million to cover operating losses of underground coal-mining undertakings.", "The United Kingdom shall inform the Commission each month of the payments actually made to beneficiaries from the provision authorized under Article 1 of this Decision and the quantities of coal covered.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 March 1994.\nFor the Commission\nAbel MATUTES\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 346, 11. 12. 1990, p. 22.\n(3) OJ No L 98, 19. 4. 1991, p. 16.\n(4) OJ No L 329, 30. 12. 1993, p. 12."}
