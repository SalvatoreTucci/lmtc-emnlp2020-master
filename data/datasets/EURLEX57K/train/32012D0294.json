The assessment of these traceability projects for a Union contribution was consequently postponed to an additional financing decision to be prepared in 2012.\n(9) In order to qualify for the contribution, automatic localisation devices should satisfy the requirements fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(3)\n(10) In order to qualify for the contribution, electronic recording and reporting devices on board fishing vessels should satisfy the requirements fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Decision provides for a Union financial contribution for 2012 towards expenditure incurred by Member States for 2012 in implementing the monitoring and control systems applicable to the common fisheries policy (CFP), as referred to in Article 8(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006.", "Closure of outstanding commitments\nAll payments in respect of which a reimbursement is claimed shall be made by the Member State concerned by 30 June 2016.
