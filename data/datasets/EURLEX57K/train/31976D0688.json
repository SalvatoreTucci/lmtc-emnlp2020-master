(2)OJ No L 356, 27.12.1973, p. 79. (3)OJ No L 46, 21.2.1976, p. 27.\nregards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive);\nWhereas therefore the application of the French Republic in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full ; whereas account should also be taken of the fact that some of these varieties are officially accepted in the French Republic provided their seed is not intended for the production of fodder plants;\nWhereas the relevant varieties of cocksfoot, with the exception of Rano Trifolium, Rozelle (tall fescue), Bounty, Champ, Glasnevin Gem (timothy), Marathon (field pea), Canson (fodder kale), the relevant varieties of swede rape with the exception of Matador, as well as Canova (barley), the French Republic is not yet in a position for reasons in part beyond its control to justify its application;\nWhereas therefore the period provided for in Article 15 (1) thereof should be extended in the case of the French Republic by an appropriate period to enable her to prepare the necessary data concerning these varieties (Article 15 (7) of the said Directive);\nWhereas other varieties are no longer included in the French application;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.
