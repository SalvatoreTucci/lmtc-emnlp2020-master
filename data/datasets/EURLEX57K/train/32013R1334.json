In order to ensure that the minimum and maximum contents set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008 are respected, the recommended dose per kilogram of complete feedingstuff has to be modified.\n(4) The proposed change of the authorisation holder is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additive concerned. The latter has been authorised on the basis of a European Food Safety Authority Opinion\u00a0(3). The subsequent request to change the recommended dose is in accordance with this same Opinion and does not entail a new assessment. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(5) In order to adapt to current practice the trade name should be deleted from Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008.\n(6) To allow Danisco (UK) Ltd to exploit its marketing rights it is necessary to change the terms of the respective authorisation.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the amendments made by this Regulation to Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008\nRegulation (EC) No 1290/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in the title, the word \u2018(Sorbiflore)\u2019 is deleted;\n(2) the Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) in the second column, the words \u2018Danisco France SAS\u2019 are replaced by \u2018Danisco (UK) Ltd\u2019;\n(b) in the third column, the word \u2018(Sorbiflore)\u2019 is deleted;\n(c) in the ninth column, point 2 is replaced as follows:\n\u20182.
