Therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications.\n(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC. It is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures should be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.\n(4) The procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III. The procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annexes III.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products and families of products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in the mandates for guidelines for European technical approval.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 June 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30.8.1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nPrefabricated wood-based load-bearing stressed skin panels:\nFor uses in buildings, except those contributing to the load-bearing capacity of the structure and/or those subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A(1), B(2), C(3), AFL(4), BFL(5), CFL(6).\nSelf-supporting composite lightweight panels:\nFor uses in buildings, except those subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A(7), B(8), C(9).\n(1) Materials for which the reaction to fire performance is susceptible to change during production;
