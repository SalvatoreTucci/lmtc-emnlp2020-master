It welcomed the French military intervention in support of the African forces to help restore security as well as the consistent commitment of its African partners to stabilize the situation. As part of a comprehensive approach, it confirmed the Union's willingness to examine the use of relevant instruments to contribute towards the efforts under way to stabilise the country, including under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), in both its military and civilian dimensions.
