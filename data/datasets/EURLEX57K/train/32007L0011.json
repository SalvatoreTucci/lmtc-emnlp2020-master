Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(f) of that Directive. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.\n(4) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised.\n(5) The Commission review reports which were prepared for the inclusion in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and if necessary, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for those substances. The exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(9) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants\u00a0(10) on the methodology employed. It has been concluded that the MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded.\n(6) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(7) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex\u00a0VI to that Directive. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit the development of further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.\n(8) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC, to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. Where MRLs have already been defined in the Annexes to those Directives, it is appropriate to amend them. Where MRLs have not already been defined, it is appropriate to set them for the first time.\n(9) Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0I to this Directive.", "Directive 86/363/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0II to this Directive.", "Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0III to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1\u00a0September 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
