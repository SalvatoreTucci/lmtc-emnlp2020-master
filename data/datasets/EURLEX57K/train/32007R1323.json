These provisional maximum residue limits (hereinafter MRLs) expired on 1 July 2007. Additional data were provided and assessed leading the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (hereinafter CVMP) to recommend that MRLs for Firocoxib should be set as definitive and consequently included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for Equidae for muscle, fat, liver and kidney.\n(3) The CVMP\u2019s recommendation is based on a provisional estimation of the substance and its residues that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without any appreciable health risk to exposed individuals (hereinafter \u2018ADI\u2019). The established temporary Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) has been determined by applying a different methodology to the usual approach used for establishing ADI of veterinary medicine. However a higher safety factor has been applied to compensate for this use in order to ensure that there are no grounds for supposing that the residues of Firocoxib at the level proposed for use present a hazard for the health of the consumer.\n(4) It is therefore proposed to include Firocoxib in Annex I of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 accordingly.\n(5) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 12 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.
