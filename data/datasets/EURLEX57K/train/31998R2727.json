whereas the Annexes to those Regulations should therefore be amended;\nWhereas the need might arise in the French overseas departments for additional supplies of pure-bred breeding bovines and horses in particular marketing years; whereas, therefore, the French authorities should be granted some leeway in their management of the scheme so they can issue aid certificates for animals intended for certain overseas departments in excess of the maximum quantities available to those departments, on condition that the overall maximum quantity available for all four overseas departments is complied with; whereas, in order to take proper account of such additional supply requirements for subsequent years, the French authorities should inform the Commission of cases in which certificates have been issued using this discretionary power;\nWhereas, as a result of the presentation by the French authorities of information on the needs of the French overseas departments, the Annexes to Regulations (EEC) No 2312/92 and (EEC) No 1148/93 should be replaced by the Annexes to this Regulation;\nWhereas the balances should be fixed on the basis of the calendar year;\nWhereas application of the criteria for fixing the amount of Community aid to the current market situation in the sector in question and, in particular, to the exchange rates and prices for those products in the European part of the Community and on the world market, gives rise to aid for the supply of the FODs with pure-bred breeding animals at the levels fixed in the Annex hereto;\nWhereas Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (6) provides that as from 1 January 1999, all references to the ecu in legal instruments are to be replaced by references to the euro at the rate of EUR 1 to ECU 1; whereas, for the sake of clarity, the denomination 'euro` should be used in this Regulation since it is to apply from 1 January 1999;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2312/92 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1148/93 is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 1999.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 1998.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 356, 24. 12. 1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 267, 9. 11. 1995, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 222, 7. 8. 1992, p. 32.\n(4) OJ L 116, 12. 5. 1993, p. 15.\n(5) OJ L 183, 26. 6. 1998, p. 18.\n(6) OJ L 162, 19. 6. 1997, p. 1.\nANNEX I\n'ANNEX III\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n`\n(1) Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions.\nANNEX II\n'ANNEX\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\n`\n(1) Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in Council Directive 90/427/EEC of 26 June 1990 on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae (OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 55)."}
