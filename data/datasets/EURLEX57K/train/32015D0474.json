Therefore that Decision should continue to apply until 31 March 2017.\n(3) Plant health checks by Member States have shown that wood packaging material used in the transport of commodities of slate, glazed ceramics and flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloy steel was also contaminated by harmful organisms, in particular Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky). Implementing Decision 2013/92/EU should therefore also cover those commodities.\n(4) Commission Implementing Directive 2014/78/EU\u00a0(3) deleted point (8) of Section I of Part A of Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore references to that point (8) in Articles 3 and 4 of Implementing Decision 2013/92/EU should be deleted.\n(5) Experience shows that a plant health check at a minimum frequency of 15 % is adequate, taking account of the phytosanitary risk of each commodity covered by this Decision, and the need to ensure a more proportionate allocation of resources for the effective and efficient checking of all commodities in an equal manner. Therefore, for certain commodities the frequency of plant health checks should be reduced from 90 % to 15 %.\n(6) Experience shows that, in order to provide further detail on the interceptions recorded on wood packaging material to the Chinese national plant protection organisation, it is necessary that Member States report the information necessary to identify the sources of unreliable marking and the reasons why a mark is considered incorrect.\n(7) In order to allow consistency as regards the plant health checks carried out in the period from 1 October 2014 to 31 March 2015 and the notification thereof, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional arrangement for that period.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2013/92/EU is amended as follows:\n1.
