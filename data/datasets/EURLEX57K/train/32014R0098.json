For the categories of spirit drinks \u2018gin\u2019 and \u2018distilled gin\u2019 there is no established limit for the addition of sweetening. However, when \u2018gin\u2019 and \u2018distilled gin\u2019 are produced without sugar or with a sugar content not exceeding 0,1 gram per litre, the possibility to use the term \u2018dry\u2019 should be extended to those spirit drinks as defined in that Annex.\n(2) Hungary has applied for the registration of \u2018\u00dajfeh\u00e9rt\u00f3i meggyp\u00e1linka\u2019 as a geographical indication in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 17(1) of that Regulation. \u2018\u00dajfeh\u00e9rt\u00f3i meggyp\u00e1linka\u2019 is a fruit spirit traditionally produced in Hungary, exclusively from the sour cherry varieties \u2018\u00dajfeh\u00e9rt\u00f3i f\u00fcrt\u00f6s\u2019 and \u2018Debreceni b\u0151term\u0151\u2019.
