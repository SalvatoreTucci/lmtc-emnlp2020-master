For the sake of simplification it is necessary to convert that amount into head for live bovines and into tonnes for other products.\n(2) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 lays down a period of validity of 75 days for export licences with advance fixing of the refund for pure-bred breeding animals falling within CN code 0102 10 and a period of four months plus the current month for licences issued under the procedure referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88. Experience has shown that those periods are too brief and that they should be extended to five months plus the current month. At the same time, there should accordingly be a derogation increasing from 21 to 90 days the time limit referred to in Article 44(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 within which the exporter must inform the agency issuing the licence of the result of a tendering procedure opened in a third country.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 is amended as follows:\n1.
