That Regulation provides for an extension of the monitoring of sheep.\n(2) Commission Decision 2005/723/EC of 14 October 2005 on programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases, of certain TSEs, and for the prevention of zoonoses, which qualify for a Community financial contribution in 2006\u00a0(3) sets out the list of such programmes, as well as the proposed rate and amount of the financial contribution by the Community for each programme.\n(3) Commission Decision 2005/873/EC of 30 November 2005 approving programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases, of certain TSEs, and for the prevention of zoonoses presented by the Member States for the year 2006\u00a0(4) sets out the financial contribution by the Community for the programmes by the Member States for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.\n(4) On 8 March 2006, a panel of experts on TSEs in small ruminants, chaired by the Community reference laboratory for TSEs, confirmed that the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in those animals cannot be excluded following the results of the second stage of discriminatory testing of brain samples of two sheep from France and one sheep from Cyprus. Further testing is necessary to exclude the presence of BSE in such animals.\n(5) In the light of the importance of an effective implementation of the increased monitoring to assess the prevalence of BSE in ovine animals, it is appropriate to increase the amount per test to be reimbursed to the Member States by the Community up to a maximum amount of EUR 30 per rapid test performed in ovine animals, in line with the cost per rapid test performed in caprine animals.\n(6) Following the detection of its first case of BSE in Sweden, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 increased the testing levels in bovine animals in that Member State. It is therefore appropriate to increase the level of the Community's financial contribution for programmes for the monitoring of TSEs in Sweden, as provided for in Decisions 2005/723/EC and 2005/873/EC.\n(7) Decisions 2005/723/EC and 2005/873/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Decision 2005/723/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "In Chapter XI of Decision 2005/873/EC, Article 11(2) and (3) are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution by the Community shall be at the rate of 100 % of the eligible costs to be incurred by each Member State referred to in paragraph 1 for the implementation of those programmes and shall not exceed:\n(a) EUR 3\u00a0375\u00a0000 for Belgium;\n(b) EUR 1\u00a0640\u00a0000 for the Czech Republic;\n(c) EUR 2\u00a0380\u00a0000 for Denmark;\n(d) EUR 15\u00a0155\u00a0000 for Germany;\n(e) EUR 285\u00a0000 for Estonia;\n(f) EUR 1\u00a0625\u00a0000 for Greece;\n(g) EUR 9\u00a0945\u00a0000 for Spain;\n(h) EUR 25\u00a0760\u00a0000 for France;\n(i) EUR 6\u00a0695\u00a0000 for Ireland;\n(j) EUR 9\u00a0045\u00a0000 for Italy;\n(k) EUR 565\u00a0000 for Cyprus;\n(l) EUR 355\u00a0000 for Latvia;\n(m) EUR 770\u00a0000 for Lithuania;\n(n) EUR 140\u00a0000 for Luxembourg;\n(o) EUR 1\u00a0415\u00a0000 for Hungary;\n(p) EUR 35\u00a0000 for Malta;\n(q) EUR 5\u00a0515\u00a0000 for the Netherlands;\n(r) EUR 2\u00a0230\u00a0000 for Austria;\n(s) EUR 3\u00a0800\u00a0000 for Poland;\n(t) EUR 2\u00a0205\u00a0000 for Portugal;\n(u) EUR 410\u00a0000 for Slovenia;\n(v) EUR 845\u00a0000 for Slovakia;\n(w) EUR 1\u00a0020\u00a0000 for Finland;\n(x) EUR 1\u00a0440\u00a0000 for Sweden;\n(y) EUR 7\u00a0700\u00a0000 for the United Kingdom.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution by the Community of the programmes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be for the tests performed and the maximum amount shall not exceed:\n(a) EUR 7 per test, for tests carried out in bovine animals referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001;\n(b) EUR 30 per test, for tests carried out in ovine and caprine animals referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001;\n(c) EUR 145 per test, for primary molecular discriminatory tests in ovine and caprine animals carried out as referred to in Annex X, Chapter C, point 3.2(c)(i) to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001;\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 September 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
