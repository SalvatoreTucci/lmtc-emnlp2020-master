Pending the establishment of harmonised certification requirements, Member States have been responsible for ensuring that imports of aquaculture animals and products thereof from third countries are subjected to conditions at least equivalent to those applying to placing on the market of Community products according to Article 20(3) of Directive 91/67/EEC.\n(3) It has been brought to the attention of the Commission that some enterprises in the Community are dependent on access to early live stages of certain species of live molluscs for further growth, fattening or relaying in Community waters, and that there is an ongoing import of these species. The supply of the relevant species amongst EU Member States and European Free Trade Association Member is limited, therefore certain third countries should be authorised for such trade for a interim period of time, pending the completion of the on-the-spot inspections provided for by Community rules. Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(4) Such temporary listing should be limited to countries of which the veterinary services have been assessed and which have been found to provide the necessary guarantees when signing export certificates of live animals, and therefore can be listed without jeopardising the animal health status of the Community.\n(5) It is also appropriate to simplify the presentation of the table in Annex I in order to avoid the repetition of requirements included in the model certificates.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The text in Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 1.
