whereas the licences issued could not be used, no such solution having been found; whereas provision should accordingly be made for the release of the securities lodged with a view to obtaining the said licences, in the same way as was done for the first quarter by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1485/89 (9);\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3182/88 (11), lays down practical rules for the management of the special arrangements; whereas pursuant to Article 12 (3) thereof the quantity remaining from the previous quarter is part of the quantity available; whereas pursuant to Article 15 (6) of the said Regulation, the said quantity available is to be fixed by the Commission on the basis of the difference between the quantity and that for which licence applications have been made, the quantities covered by unused licences being ignored;\nWhereas applications in respect of the first and second quarters of 1989 covered quantities exceeding those available for those two quarters; whereas the Commission accordingly fixed a single percentage to reduce the quantities applied for; whereas, however, owing to Decision 89/15/EEC, licences issued in respect of the first and second quarters of 1989 could not be used in full;\nWhereas the lifting of the suspension of imports by Commission Decision 89/353/EEC (12), amending Decision 89/15/EEC, enables imports of those products from the United States of America to be resumed; whereas, in order to enable the quota for 1989 fixed in Regulation (EEC) No 4148/88 to be used in full, quantities not used during the first two quarters of 1989 should be permitted to be transferred to the fourth quarters;
