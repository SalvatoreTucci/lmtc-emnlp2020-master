Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) The applications concern the authorisation of Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 16774), Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 12856), Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16245), Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16773), Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12836), Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12837), Lactobacillus brevis (DSM 12835), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (NCIMB 30121), Lactococcus lactis (DSM 11037) Lactococcus lactis (NCIMB 30160), Pediococcus acidilactici (DSM 16243) and Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 12834) as feed additives for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 6 September 2011 on Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 16774)\u00a0(2), Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 12856)\u00a0(3) and on Lactobacillus brevis (DSM 12835)\u00a0(4), that these micro-organisms do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that they have the potential to improve the production of silage from all forages by increasing acetic production resulting in an extended aerobic stability of the silage. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(5) The Authority concluded in its opinions of 6 September 2011 on Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16245)\u00a0(5), on Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16773)\u00a0(6), Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12836)\u00a0(7)\nLactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12837)\u00a0(8), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (NCIMB 30121)\u00a0(9)\nLactococcus lactis (NCIMB 30160)\u00a0(10)\nPediococcus acidilactici (DSM 16243)\u00a0(11) and on Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 12834)\u00a0(12), and in its opinion of 8 September 2011 on Lactococcus lactis (DSM 11037)\u00a0(13) that these micro-organisms do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that they have the potential to improve the production of silage from all forages by reducing the pH and increasing the preservation of the dry matter. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 16774), Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 12856), Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16245), Lactobacillus paracasei (DSM 16773),Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12836), Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 12837), Lactobacillus brevis (DSM 12835), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (NCIMB 30121), Lactococcus lactis (DSM 11037), Lactococcus lactis (NCIMB 30160), Pediococcus acidilactici (DSM 16243) and Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 12834) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those micro-organisms should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The micro-organisms specified in the Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2359.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2361.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2368.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2363.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2370.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2367.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2362.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2365.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2366.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2364.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2369.\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2374.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
