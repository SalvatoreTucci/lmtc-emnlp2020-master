whereas the level of telecommunications services, especially of advanced services intended for the productive sector in those regions, is inadequate and whereas this shortcoming has an adverse effect on both their socio-economic situation and their development prospects;\nWhereas on 29 and 30 March 1985 the European Council endorsed objectives aimed at strengthening the technological base and competitiveness of Community industry; whereas those objectives include 'achieving a breakthrough in telecommunications'; whereas one of the lines of action adopted on 17 December 1984 by the Council in this field is designed to ensure 'improved access for less-favoured regions of the Community to the benefits of the development of advanced services and networks';\nWhereas fuller integration of the least-favoured regions into telecommunications networks and appropriae use by them of advanced telecommunications services are necessary if they are to reduce the extent to which they lag behind in terms of economic development, since such services will reduce their isolation, will allow them to participate in the Community's technological breakthrough and will foster job creation;\nWhereas use of advanced telecommunications services presupposes the establishment of the necessary infrastructures such as major links for the regions of the new networks, digitalization to promote more rapid introduction of integrated-services digital networks, the creation of additional capacities essential to the provision of advanced services notably in the field of high-speed data transmission, and the establishment and development of cellular radio infrastructures in a way compatible with the coordinated introduction of a future pan-European radio-telephony cellular digital system;\nWhereas the establishment of modern telecommunications infrastructures must be accompanied by measures to promote the supply of, and the demand for, advanced services facilitating optimum use of those infrastructures; whereas such promotion includes aid for the preparation of regional or local programmes for the coordinated use of telecommunication systems, advisory and publicity measures, demonstration projects, aid for small and medium-sized enterprises in order to encourage them to use advanced systems and to promote their activities in the telecommunications fields, service centres, experimental tele-commuting projects and the development of regional specialized information services;\nWhereas the Member States concerned have communicated the necessary information to the Commission;\nWhereas, by helping the least-favoured regions to exploit the new telecommunications potential, the Community programme contributes to the furtherance of both regional development objectives and the Community's objectives in the field of telecommunications; whereas the level of Community participation must, therefore, be the maximum permissible under the Fund Regulation and whereas, at the same time, the programme is given priority in the management of Fund resources;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2615/80 (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 214/84 (2), and Regulation (EEC) No 215/84 (3) instituting specific Community measures contributing to the development of certain regions in the context of Community enlargement permit the financing of certain measures in the telecommunications field and whereas aid granted under those Regulations should not be combined with aid granted under this Community programme;\nWhereas Community assistance must be provided in the form of multiannual programmes drawn up by the competent authorities in the Member States concerned; whereas, in order to ensure sound financial management of the Fund, Member States will need to transmit such assistance programmes to the Commission within a specific period following the entry into force of the Community programme; whereas it is for the Commission, in adopting those programmes, to ensure that the operations proposed therein are in keeping with this Regulation,", "main_body": ["A Community programme within the meaning of Article 7 of the Fund Regulation is hereby established in order to contribute to the development of certain less-favoured regions of the Community by improving access to advanced telecommunications services.", "The purpose of the Community programme shall be to contribute to strengthening the economic base in the regions concerned, to foster job creation and to help raise technological standards in those regions, by improving the supply of advanced telecommunications services and by integrating those regions into large telecommunications networks.
