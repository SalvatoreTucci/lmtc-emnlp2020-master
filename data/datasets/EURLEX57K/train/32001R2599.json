Those arrangements were repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 with effect from 1 November 1998. A quantity of vat bottom residues are still held in stock by those intervention agencies. These residues contain a considerable percentage of oil. To ensure a smooth transition from the intervention arrangements to the present situation in which those arrangements no longer exist, the sale of the olive oil bought in by the intervention agencies under the arrangements now repealed and still held in stock should be authorised.\n(2) Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 of 23 November 1978 on intervention in the olive oil sector(3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2203/90(4), provides that Community olive oil held by the intervention agencies is to be put up for sale by tender except when particular conditions necessitate recourse to other procedures.\n(3) For commercial reasons based chiefly on the fact that there is no well-defined market or price system for the product in question, it is not possible to use the sale by tender procedure. The Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies should therefore sell the product at the best price they can obtain whilst ensuring that Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 is complied with. A second sale may be envisaged if the product remains totally or partly unsold after the first sale.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the management Committee foir Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.
