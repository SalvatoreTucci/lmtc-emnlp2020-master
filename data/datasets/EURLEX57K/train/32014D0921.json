The measure would thus have immediate positive effects on human life and health in these regions.\n(3) The measure should be limited to accredited special-purpose machines designed and built specifically for clearing mined areas.\n(4) The measure should be limited to mine-contaminated areas in the territory of Croatia.\n(5) The measure should apply to all operators involved in humanitarian demining in Croatia, thus no economic advantage will be given to any particular operator involved.\n(6) Consequently, the measure is acceptable for the proper functioning of the internal market and for the need to ensure fair competition. The measure is compatible with the Union's health, environment, energy and transport policies.\n(7) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that Article must be strictly limited in time. In order to provide economic operators concerned with a sufficient degree of certainty and enough time to conclude the process of demining of the contaminated areas, the authorisation should be granted for a period of six years.\n(8) This Decision is without prejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,", "main_body": ["Croatia is hereby authorised to exempt gas oil used to operate specialised machinery used in humanitarian demining on its territory from taxation.
