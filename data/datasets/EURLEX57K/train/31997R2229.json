whereas therefore, the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2967/93 of 25 October 1993 prohibiting the supply of certain goods to UNITA (2), should be incorporated in this Regulation, and the former Regulation should be repealed,", "main_body": ["The following shall be prohibited:\n1. to sell or supply petroleum and petroleum products listed in Annex I, whether or not originating in the Community, in the territory of Angola through points of entry other than those referred to in Annex II;\n2. to supply or make available in any form any aircraft or aircraft components to the territory of Angola other than through the points of entry referred to in Annex III;\n3. to provide engineering and maintenance services, certification of airworthiness, payment of new claims against existing insurance contracts or provision or renewal of direct insurance with respect to any aircraft registered in Angola other than those listed in Annex IV, or with respect to any aircraft which entered the territory of Angola other than through a point of entry referred to in Annex V;\n4. to permit any aircraft to take off from, land in or overfly the territory of the Community if it has taken off from or is destined to land at a place in the territory of Angola other than one listed in Annex V;\n5. to start or continue, in any form, any operational activity of any UNITA office;\n6. any activity the object or effect of which is, directly or indirectly, to promote the transactions or activities referred to in this Article.", "The prohibition of the transactions or activities referred to in Article 1 shall not apply to cases of medical urgency or to flights of aircraft carrying food, medicine or supplies for essential humanitarian needs, on condition that, through the competent national authorities, a prior approval has been obtained from the United Nations Security Council Committee created pursuant to Resolution 864 (1993).\nThe names and addresses of the competent national authorities are contained in Annex VI.", "This Regulation shall apply notwithstanding any rights conferred or obligations imposed by any international agreement signed or any contract entered into or any licence or permit granted before the entry into force of this Regulation.", "Each Member State shall determine the sanctions to be imposed where the provisions of this Regulation are infringed.\nPending the adoption, where necessary, of any legislation to this end, the sanctions to be imposed where the provisions of this Regulation are infringed shall be those determined by the Member States in order to give effect to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/93.", "The Commission and the Member States shall inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and supply each other with other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, such as violation and other enforcement problems or judgments made by national courts.", "The Commission is hereby empowered to supplement and/or amend the Annexes on the basis of the information and notifications supplied by the competent authorities of the United Nations or, in the case of Annex VI, the Member States.\nAny supplements or amendments made pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.", "Regulation (EEC) No 2967/93 is hereby repealed and replaced by the provisions of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall apply within the territory of the European Community including its air space and on any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of a Member State and to any person elsewhere who is a national of a Member State and any body which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 30 October 1997 and, in the case of Articles 4 and 7, from the day of its publication in the Official Journal.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 30 October 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
