4 and 6 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.\n(2) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria shall be established according to product groups.\n(3) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that the review of the eco-label criteria as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria shall take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group and shall result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.\n(4) By Decision 98/488/EC(2), the Commission established ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to soil improvers, which, according to Article 3 thereof, as amended by Decision 2001/157/EC(3), expire on 30 September 2002.\n(5) It is appropriate to revise the definition of the product group and the ecological criteria that were established by Decision 98/488/EC in order to reflect the developments in the market.\n(6) It is appropriate to adopt a new Commission Decision establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years.\n(7) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 12 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria previously established by Decision 98/488/EC, are valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded the eco-label for their products prior to the adoption of this new Decision to adapt these products to comply with the new criteria.\n(8) The measures set out in this Decision have been developed and adopted under the procedures for the setting of eco-label criteria as laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.\n(9) The measures set out in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,", "main_body":

(hereinafter referred to as \"the product\" or \"products\") must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex, with tests carried out on application as indicated in the criteria.\nTesting shall where applicable be carried out in accordance with test methods developed by Technical Committee CEN 223 \"Soil improvers and growing media\".\nSampling shall be carried out in accordance with methodologies set out by CEN/TC 223 (WG 3) as specified and approved by CEN in EN 12579 - Soil improvers and growing media - Sampling. Where testing or sampling is required that is not covered by these methods and sampling techniques, the competent body or bodies assessing the application (hereinafter referred to as the \"competent body\") shall indicate which testing and/or sampling methods it considers acceptable.\nWhere appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)\nThese criteria aim in particular at promoting:\n- the use and/or re-use of organic matter derived from the collection and/or processing of waste material and therefore contributing to a minimisation of solid waste at the final disposal (e.g. at landfill),\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks from heavy metals and other hazardous compounds in soil improvers and growing media.\nThe criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of soil improvers and growing media that have a lower environmental impact during the whole life-cycle of the product.\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n1. Organic ingredients\n(a) A product shall only be considered for the award of an eco-label if its organic matter content is derived from the processing and/or re-use of waste materials (as defined in Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste(1), as amended by Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991 amending Directive 75/442/EEC on waste(2), and in Annex I to the said Directive). Note: the term \"organic\" refers in the general sense to materials of, or formed from/by, living organisms.\n(b) Products shall not contain sewage sludge.\nThe applicant shall provide the competent body with the detailed composition of the product, and a declaration of compliance with each of the above requirements.\n2. Limitation of hazardous substances\n(a) In the final product, the content of the following elements shall be lower than the values shown below, measured in terms of dry weight:\n>TABLE>\nThe applicant shall provide the competent body with the relevant test reports, and a declaration of compliance with this requirement.\n(b) Products shall not contain bark which has been treated with pesticides.\nThe applicant shall provide the competent body with a declaration of compliance with this requirement.\n3.
