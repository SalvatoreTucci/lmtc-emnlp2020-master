For that purpose, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof (\u2018countries or regions\u2019) is to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved, namely a negligible BSE risk, a controlled BSE risk and an undetermined BSE risk.\n(2) The Annex to Commission Decision 2007/453/EC of 29 June 2007 establishing the BSE status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof according to their BSE risk\u00a0(2) lists countries or regions according to their BSE risk status.\n(3) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) plays a leading role in the categorisation of countries or regions according to their BSE risk. The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC takes account of Resolution No 17 \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Members \u2014 adopted by the OIE in May 2011 regarding the BSE status of Member States and third countries.\n(4) In May 2012, the OIE adopted Resolution No 16 \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Member Countries. That Resolution recognised Austria, Belgium, Brazil and Colombia as having a negligible BSE risk, and Croatia and Nicaragua as having a controlled BSE risk. The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended to be brought into line with that Resolution as regards those Member States and third countries.\n(5) Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 August 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 84.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nLIST OF COUNTRIES OR REGIONS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a negligible BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Belgium\n\u2014 Denmark\n\u2014 Austria\n\u2014 Finland\n\u2014 Sweden\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Iceland\n\u2014 Norway\nThird countries\n\u2014 Argentina\n\u2014 Australia\n\u2014 Brazil\n\u2014 Chile\n\u2014 Colombia\n\u2014 India\n\u2014 New Zealand\n\u2014 Panama\n\u2014 Paraguay\n\u2014 Peru\n\u2014 Singapore\n\u2014 Uruguay\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a controlled BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, United Kingdom\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Liechtenstein\n\u2014 Switzerland\nThird countries\n\u2014 Canada\n\u2014 Croatia\n\u2014 Japan\n\u2014 Mexico\n\u2014 Nicaragua\n\u2014 South Korea\n\u2014 Taiwan\n\u2014 United States\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with an undetermined BSE risk\n\u2014 Countries or regions not listed in point A or B of this Annex.\u2019"}
