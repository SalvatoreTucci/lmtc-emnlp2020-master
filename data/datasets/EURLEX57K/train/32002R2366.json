The duties and quantities as referred to in this Regulation have been fixed in accordance with international agreements in force during the year 2003. Accordingly it is necessary to prepare this Commission Regulation establishing Community tariff quotas for 2003 for sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat falling within CN codes 0104 10 30, 0104 10 80, 0104 20 90, 0210 99 21, 0210 99 29 and 0204.\n(7) A carcasse-weight equivalent needs to be fixed in order to ensure a proper functioning of the Community tariff quotas; furthermore, since certain tariff quotas provide the option of importing either the live animals or their meat, a conversion factor is required.\n(8) Community tariff quotas must be managed in accordance with the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1439/95(14).\n(9) With regard to sheepmeat products it is difficult to establish, at the moment of their submission for import to the customs authorities, whether these products originate from domestic sheep or other than domestic sheep. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide that the document of origin contains a clarification to this end.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheepmeat and Goatmeat,", "main_body": ["This Regulation opens Community tariff quotas for the sheepmeat and goatmeat sectors for the period 1 January to 31 December 2003.", "The customs duties applicable to imports into the Community of sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat falling within CN codes 0104 10 30, 0104 10 80, 0104 20 90, 0210 99 21, 0210 99 29 and 0204 originating in the countries indicated in the Annex shall be suspended or reduced in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
