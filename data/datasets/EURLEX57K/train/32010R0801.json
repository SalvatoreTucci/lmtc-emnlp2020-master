Flag State performance shall be calculated using a standard formula for statistical calculations in which certain values are fixed. The black to grey and grey to white limits are defined by the following formulas:\n2. The formulas set out in point 1 shall provide the allowed number of detentions for either the black or the white list. A number of detentions above the black to grey limit means worse than average and is to be subsequently listed under the black list, while a number of detentions below the white to grey limit means better than average and is to be subsequently listed under the white list. When the amount of detentions for a particular flag State is positioned between the two, the flag State shall be listed under the grey list.\n3. In order to compare the performance of flag States listed on the black, grey or white lists, the calculation is repeated adjusting p in the formulas set out in Point 1.\n4. In order to make flag State performance comparable, the excess factor (EF) shall be used. The EF is an indication of the number of times that p has to be altered and recalculated until the number of detentions for a flag State equals the limits. Any 3\u00a0% increment or decrement in p corresponds to one whole EF-point. For flag States categorized in the grey list, the EF shall be calculated using the following formula:\n5. The following EF values shall be considered in order to sort black listed flag States into very high, high, medium to high or medium risk:\nEF = 4,01 and more means very high risk\nEF = 3,01 to 4,00 means high risk\nEF = 2,01 to 3,00 means medium to high risk\nEF = 1,01 to 2,00 means medium risk."}
