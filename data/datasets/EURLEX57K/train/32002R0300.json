Some of these chemicals are subject to the international Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).\n(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 provides for the participation of the Community in the international PIC procedure.\n(3) The UNEP/FAO arrangements have been subsumed in the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC), which was signed on 11 September 1998 and which is being applied voluntarily on an interim basis pending its entry into force.\n(4) Article 5(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 provides, inter alia, that the information in Annex II to that Regulation is to comprise the list of chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure, a list of the countries participating in the PIC scheme and the PIC decisions of importing countries. It is necessary to give exporters additional information by listing interim decisions of participating importing countries in Annex II.\n(5) A number of amendments have been made to the list of chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure and to the PIC decisions of importing countries. Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 29 of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/59/EC(4),", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 February 2002.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 251, 29.8.1992, p. 13.\n(2) OJ L 282, 20.10.1998, p. 12.\n(3) OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 225, 21.8.2001, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\"Annex II\nThe information contained in this Annex is based on the PIC Circular XIII - June 2001\n1.

Nevertheless, the DGD is not the only information taken into account by countries when they take their import decision.\nTherefore, the import decision does not necessarily refer to the uses mentioned in the DGD.\nFor some chemicals, the PIC procedure applies to certain specific formulations only.
