The Annex to that Decision contains a list of specific numbers within this numbering range and the services for which each number is reserved. This list may be adapted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(3) of Directive 2002/21/EC.\n(2) Two services, namely Helpline for victims of crime and Non-emergency medical on-call service, have been identified as services of social value that may qualify for harmonised numbers. For these reasons, Decision 2007/116/EC should be updated and additional reserved numbers introduced. The number for Non-emergency medical on-call service is not intended to replace 112 or national emergency call numbers in life-threatening situations.\n(3) Decision 2007/116/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Communications Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/116/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that as from 15 April 2010 the competent National Regulatory Authority can assign those numbers added to the list by virtue of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a033.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a049, 17.2.2007, p.\u00a030.\nANNEX\nList of numbers reserved for harmonised services of social value\nNumber Service for which this number is reserved Specific conditions attached to the right of use for this number\n116\u00a0000 Name of service: Service continuously available (i.e. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, nation-wide).\n116\u00a0006 Name of the service: Where the service is not continuously available (i.e. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, nation-wide), the service provider must ensure that information about availability is made publicly available in an easily accessible form, and that, during periods of unavailability, callers to the service are advised when the service will next become available.\n116\u00a0111 Name of the service: Where the service is not continuously available (i.e. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, nation-wide), the service provider must ensure that information about availability is made publicly available in an easily accessible form, and that, during periods of unavailability, callers to the service are advised when the service will next become available.\n116\u00a0117 Name of the service: Where the service is not continuously available (i.e. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, nation-wide), the service provider must ensure that information about availability is made publicly available in an easily accessible form, and that, during periods of unavailability, callers to the service are advised when the service will next become available.\n116\u00a0123 Name of the service: Where the service is not continuously available (i.e. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, nation-wide), the service provider must ensure that information about availability is made publicly available in an easily accessible form, and that, during periods of unavailability, callers to the service are advised when the service will next become available."}
