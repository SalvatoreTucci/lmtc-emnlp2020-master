A request has been made to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use to consider whether the existing entry for diclofenac, for bovine species in that Annex should be extended to include maximum residue limits applicable to milk. Following examination of the request, it is considered appropriate to amend the existing entry for diclofenac in Annex I for bovine species to include the established maximum residue limits applicable to milk.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) It is necessary to provide for an adequate period before this Regulation becomes applicable, in order to enable the Member States to make any necessary adjustments with respect to the existing authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community Code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) on the market.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 60 days after publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0311, 28.11.2001, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nIn point 4.1.6 of Annex I (List of pharmacologically active substances for which maximum residue limits have been fixed) to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 the entry for \u2018Diclofenac\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active substance(s) Marker residue Animal species MRLs Target tissues\n\u2018Diclofenac Diclofenac Bovine 5 \u03bcg/kg Muscle\n1 \u03bcg/kg Fat\n5 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n10 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\n0,1 \u03bcg/kg Milk\nPorcine 5 \u03bcg/kg Muscle\n1 \u03bcg/kg Skin\u00a0+\u00a0fat\n5 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n10 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\u2019"}
