Gas-liquid chromatograph, together with an electronic integrator, as described in Section III of Annex VI to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 72/77.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of fatty-acid methyl esters\nTake about 400 mg of the oil or fat component of the sample for analysis and prepare a solution containing about 20 to 50 mg/ml of the fatty acid methyl esters in n-hexane by the method described in Section II.3 of Annex VI to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 72/77.\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thin-layer chromatography\n6.2.1. Place 60 g silica gel (4.3) in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask, add 120 ml of silver nitrate solution (4.5) and shake for one minute to obtain a fully homogeneous slurry. Spread the slurry in the usual manner over the plates; the thickness of the layer should be approximately 0.5 mm. This quantity of slurry is sufficient for the preparation of five 200 x 200 mm plates.\n6.2.2. Using the applicator (5.1.5) deposit 50 \u03bcl of the solution of methyl esters (6.1) prepared from the sample in a narrow streak about 50 mm long, at least 40 mm from the side of the plate and 10 mm from the bottom. Apply in a similar way 100 \u03bcl of a solution containing equal volumes of the prepared solution of methyl esters (6.1) and the methyl erucate solution (4.6). Take particular care during the application of solutions because of the fragile nature of the coating. (Note: if desired, 50 \u03bcl of the methyl erucate solution (4.6) may be applied to the plate to assist in identifying the methyl erucate band after development: see figure). After the application of the methyl esters stand the bottom edge of the plate in diethyl ether until the ether ascends to about 5 mm above the area of sample application. This concentrates the methyl esters in a narrow band.\n6.2.3. Pour the development solvent (4.8) into the tank to a depth of about 5 mm and place the tank, complete with lid, in a deep freeze cabinet (5.1.1) held at minus 25 oC, or as near to this temperature as possible. (In some cases it may be advantageous to line the tank). After two hours, place the plate carefully in the tank and allow the solvent to ascend to about one half to two thirds of the height of the plate. Remove the plate and gently evaporate the solvent from it in a nitrogen stream. Replace the plate in the tank and allow the solvent to ascend to the top of the plate. Remove the plate and as previously dry in a nitrogen stream and then spray carefully with 2,7 dichlorofluorescein solution (4.9).\n6.2.4. Scrape off the methyl erucate band derived from the sample into a 50 ml beaker taking care to avoid losses. Similarly transfer the silica gel located above and below the methyl erucate band into another 50 ml beaker. This band will contain all the other fatty-acid methyl ester fractions. Add 1\u03870 ml of the methyl tetracosanoate standard solution (4.7) and 10 ml of diethyl ether (4.1) to each beaker. Stir, and transfer the contents of the beakers to separate columns or funnels (5.1.4) each containing about 1 g silica gel (4.4); elute the methyl esters using three or four 10 ml portions of diethyl ether. Collect the filtrates in small flasks. Evaporate each filtrate to a small volume using a gentle nitrogen stream and transfer the methyl esters to small pointed-bottom glass tubes. Remove all the solvent by evaporation with a nitrogen stream in such a way that the methyl esters concentrate at the bottom of the tubes. Dissolve the methyl esters in about 25 to 50 \u03bcl of n-hexane (4.2).\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gas-liquid chromatography\n6.3.1. Carry out the procedure described in Section III of Annex VI to Commission Regulation 72/77/EEC and analyze 1 to 2 \u03bcl of the methyl ester solutions obtained from (i) the fraction containing methyl erucate, and (ii) the fractions containing the remainder of the methylated fatty acids.\n6.3.2. Obtain from the electronic integrator the following peak areas:\n(i) from the chromatogram of the fraction containing the methyl erucate:\n(a) methyl erucate [E]\n(b) internal standard [L1]\n(c) total methyl ester peak areas excluding the internal standard [EF]\n(ii) from the chromatogram of the fractions containing the remainder of te fatty acid methyl esters\n(a) total methyl ester peak areas excluding the internal standard [RF]\n(b) internal standard [L2]\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of calculation and formula\n7.1.1. The erucic acid content of the sample, expressed in terms of its methyl ester as a percentage of the total fatty acid methyl esters prepared from the sample, is given by:\n7.1.2. If peak areas are obtained in percentages the values for EF and RF may be calculated as follows:\nEF = 100 \u2014 L1\nRF = 100 \u2014 L2\n7.1.3. The method of calculation (7.1.1) assumes that the level of tetracosanoic acid in the sample is negligible. If significant amounts of this acid are shown to be present the value for tetracosanoic acid (L2) obtained from the chromatogram of the fractions containing the remainder of the fatty acid methyl esters must be reduced to:\nL2 \u2014 T2\nT2 =\nT2 = peak area of methyl tetracosanoate derived from the sample and which forms part of the peak area attributed to the internal standard in the chromatogram of the remaining fraction of fatty acid methyl esters\np2 = peak area of methyl palmitate obtained from the chromatogram of the remaining fraction\nT0 = peak area of methyl tetracosanoate obtained from the chromatogram of the methyl esters of the total fatty acids as determined by the analysis referred to in Article 2 of this Directive\np0 = peak area of methyl palmitate obtained from the chromatogram of the methyl esters of the total fatty acids as as determined by the analysis referred to in Article 2 of this Directive."}
