Therefore, it is appropriate to review the classification of the facility as necessary and at least at the end of the operational phase.\n(4) In order to assess the potential for loss of life and danger for human health in cases of loss of structural integrity, or incorrect operation, of a facility, the actual permanent presence of people in the potentially affected areas should be taken into account when assessing the significance of that potential loss of life or danger for human health.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A waste facility shall be classified under Category A in accordance with the first indent of Annex III of Directive 2006/21/EC if the predicted consequences in the short or the long term of a failure due to loss of structural integrity, or due to incorrect operation of a waste facility could lead to:\n(a) non-negligible potential for loss of life;\n(b) serious danger to human health;\n(c) serious danger to the environment.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of the classification referred to in paragraph 1, the entire life-cycle of the facility, including the after-closure phase, shall be considered in the evaluation of the hazard potential of the facility.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Decision, structural integrity of a waste facility shall mean its ability to contain the waste within the boundaries of the facility in the manner for which it was designed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The loss of structural integrity shall cover all possible failure mechanisms relevant to the structures of the waste facility concerned.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An evaluation of the consequences of the loss of structural integrity shall comprise the immediate impact of any material transported from the facility as a consequence of the failure and the resulting short and long term effects.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Decision, incorrect operation of the waste facility shall mean any operation which may give rise to a major accident, including the malfunction of environmental protection measures and faulty or insufficient design.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An assessment of the release of contaminants resulting from incorrect operation shall comprise the effects of short-term pulses as well as of the long-term release of contaminants.

Injuries leading to disability or prolonged states of ill-health shall count as serious dangers to human health.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The potential danger for the environment shall be considered to be not serious if:\n(a) the intensity of the potential contaminant source strength is decreasing significantly within a short time;\n(b) the failure does not lead to any permanent or long-lasting environmental damage;\n(c) the affected environment can be restored through minor clean-up and restoration efforts.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In establishing the potential for loss of life or danger to

that facility may not be classified as Category A where it is justified on the basis of a site specific risk assessment, with specific focus on the effects of the hazardous waste, carried out as part of the classification based on the consequences of failure due to loss of integrity or incorrect operation, and demonstrating that the facility should not be classified as Category A on the basis of the contents of hazardous waste.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the ratio referred in paragraph 1 is less than 5\u00a0%, then the facility shall not be classified as Category A on the basis of the
