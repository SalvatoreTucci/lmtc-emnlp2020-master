The breeder\u2019s association or organisation must have justified the necessity for an Annex to the flock-book for males in the context of the breeding programme.\n3. The conditions under which progeny of males entered in an Annex to the flock-book may enter the main section of the flock-book, must be laid down and be at least as stringent as those applicable to the respective females.
