Therefore, the minimum mesh size rules set by Article 9(3)(2) do not apply.\n(14) The Italian management plan includes measures for the monitoring of fishing activities, thus fulfilling the conditions set out in Article 23 and in the third subparagraph of Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006.\n(15) The fishing activities concerned take place at a very short distance from the coast and therefore do not interfere with the activities of other vessels.\n(16) The Italian management plan ensures that catches of species mentioned in Annex III are minimal and that the fishing activities do not target cephalopods.\n(17) Italy communicated to the Commission the list of authorised fishing vessels and their characteristics, as well as the comparison with the characteristics of that fleet on 1 January 2000.\n(18) Accordingly, the requested derogation should be granted.\n(19) Italy should report to the Commission in due time and in accordance with the monitoring plan provided for in the Italian management plan.\n(20) In line with the request by Italy, a limitation in duration of the derogation will allow ensuring prompt corrective management measures in case the report to the Commission will show a poor conservation status of the exploited stock while providing scope to improve the scientific basis for an improved management plan.\n(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["3(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006 shall not apply, in territorial waters of Italy adjacent to the coast of Liguria and Tuscany, to fishing for transparent goby (Aphia minuta) by boat seines which are used by vessels:\n(a) registered in the maritime Directorates (Direzioni Marittime) of Genoa and Livorno respectively;\n(b) having a track record in the fishery of more than 5 years; and\n(c) holding a fishing authorisation and operating under the management plan adopted by Italy in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the management plan\u2019)\u00a0(4).\nThis derogation shall apply until 31 March 2014.", "Monitoring plan and report\nItaly shall communicate to the Commission, by 1 May 2014, a report drawn up in accordance with the monitoring plan established in the management plan.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 36, 8.2.2007, p. 6.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 190, 4.7.1998, p. 34.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana 192, 19.8.2011, supplemento ordinario n. 192.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana 192, 19.8.2011, supplemento ordinario n. 192."}
