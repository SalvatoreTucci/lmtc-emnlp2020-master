In addition, those rules require seed and planting stock of the \u2018source identified\u2019, \u2018selected\u2019 and \u2018qualified\u2019 categories to be officially certified and the seed packages to be officially closed in accordance with the OECD Forest Seed and Plant Scheme.\n(4) An examination of those rules as regards the \u2018qualified\u2019 category has shown that the conditions for approval of basic material satisfy the requirements laid down in Council Directive 1999/105/EC of 22 December 1999 on the marketing of forest reproductive material\u00a0(4). Furthermore, with the exception of the conditions regarding seed quality, species purity and planting stock quality, the rules of these third countries afford the same guarantees as regards the conditions applicable to seed and planting stock of the new \u2018qualified\u2019 category as those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC. It follows that the rules relating to the certification of forestry material of the \u2018qualified\u2019 category in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States should be considered to be equivalent to those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC, provided that the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2008/971/EC are satisfied as regards seed and planting stocks.\n(5) As regards material of the \u2018qualified\u2019 category, those conditions should include the provision of information on whether the products have been genetically modified or not. Such information should facilitate the application of the requirements set out in Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms\u00a0(5), or, where applicable, in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed\u00a0(6) and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms\u00a0(7).\n(6) In addition, the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production, as listed in Annex I to Decision 2008/971/EC, have changed.\n(7) Decision 2008/971/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/971/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(3) in Article 4, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(4) Annexes I and II are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 21 November 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
