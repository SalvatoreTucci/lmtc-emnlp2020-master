The Commission has received a request to open additional quotas in view of trade fairs to be held in 2001.\n(2) Additional quotas have already been opened for trade fairs in previous years for certain third countries.\n(3) Access to the additional quotas should be limited to products which have been exhibited by the exporting countries at the relevant fair and for the quantities agreed to by sales contracts, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where the fair is taking place.\n(4) In order to avoid an over-utilisation of these additional quotas it appears appropriate to request the Member State on the territory of which the fair is taking place, on the one hand, to ensure that the total amounts covered by certified contracts do not exceed the limits set for these additional quotas and, on the other hand, to inform the Commission after closure of the fair of the total quantities covered by such certified contracts.\n(5) It seems appropriate to apply to imports into the Community of products for which the additional quotas are opened the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 which are applicable to imports of products subject to quantitative limits set out in Annex V to the said Regulation, with the exception of those relating to flexibilities.\n(6) Requests for import authorisations should moreover be accompanied by the contract signed at the relevant fair, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where it is held.\n(7) In order to avoid circumvention, issue of import authorisations should only cover products shipped in the supplier country in which they originate no earlier than 1 January 2002.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in conformity with the opinion of the Textile Committee,", "main_body": ["In addition to the quantitative limits on imports established by Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, additional quotas for quota year 2002 shall be opened in respect of the trade fairs to be held in November 2001 in the European Community as set out in the Annex hereto.", "1.
