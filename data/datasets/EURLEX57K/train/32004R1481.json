Therefore, a further typography has to be allowed in the graphic manual.\n(2) Annex VI, Section C, to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 lists the ingredients of agricultural origin which have not been produced organically but which may be used in the preparation of foodstuffs in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation, provided that it has been shown that such ingredients obtained by the organic production method are not available in sufficient quantities within the Community.\n(3) After it had been established that organically produced casings were not available in sufficient quantities within the Community, Annex VI, Section C, to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 473/2002\u00a0(2), in order to include casings in the list of agricultural ingredients, for a transitional period expiring on 1 April 2004.\n(4) It appears, however, that the availability in organically produced casings still remains very limited and that it is unlikely that sufficient quantities will be available in the future. It is therefore necessary to allow the use of casings not produced according to the organic farming method without any limit in time.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended as follows:\n1.
