That Decision demarcates and lists restricted areas in an Annex differentiated by the level of risk considering the epidemiological situation. It also lays down animal health rules on the movement, dispatch and marking of pigs and certain pig products from those affected Member States, in order to prevent the spread of that disease to other areas of the Union.\n(3) On 26 June 2014, cases of African swine fever in feral pigs, specifically in wild boar, were reported in Latvia due to the introduction of the African swine fever virus from neighbouring third countries where that disease is present. The introduction of the virus in two low-biosecurity small farms in the same area was also reported. Those outbreaks, taken together with the cases in wild boar adjacent to the external border of the Union, have to be considered in the assessment of the risk represented by the current epidemiological situation. In order to focus the control measures and to prevent disease spread as well as to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, the Union list of infected areas in Latvia is to be urgently established on the basis of the risk the disease represents for the Union and in collaboration with the Member State concerned.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU to include the relevant territories of Latvia in Part I and Part II of the Annex thereto.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever (OJ L\u00a0192, 20.7.2002, p.\u00a027).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU of 27 March 2014 concerning animal health control measures relating to African swine fever in certain Member States (OJ L\u00a095, 29.3.2014, p.\u00a047).\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) In Part I, the following point is added:\nIn the novads of R\u0113zeknes the pagasti of Sto\u013cerovas, Gri\u0161k\u0101nu, \u010cornajas, L\u016bznavas, Maltas, Feima\u0146u, Silmalas and Ozolaines.\nIn the novads of Riebi\u0146i the pagasti of Riebi\u0146u, Ru\u0161onas and Silaj\u0101\u0146u.\nIn the novads of Prei\u013ci the pagasti of Pel\u0113\u010du, Prei\u013cu and Aizkalnes.\nIn the novads of Ludza the pagasti of Cirmas, Pure\u0146u, \u0145uk\u0161u, Isnaudas, Pildas, Nirzas and Bri\u0123u.\nIn the novads of Zilupe the pagasti of Lauderu and Za\u013cesjes.\nIn the novads of Daugavpils the pagasti of Dubnas, Vi\u0161\u0137u, Ambe\u013cu, Bi\u0137ernieku, Naujenes, Salienas, Vecsalienas, Skrudalienas, Demenes, Laucesas, Tabores and Ma\u013cinovas.\nThe whole of the novads of Ciblas.\u2019\n(2) In Part II, the following point is added:\nIn the novads of R\u0113zeknes the pagasti of Pu\u0161as, M\u0101ko\u0146kalna and Kaunatas.\nThe whole of the novads of Dagdas.\nIn the novads of Aglonas the pagasti of \u0160\u0137eltovas, Gr\u0101veru and Kastu\u013cinas.\nThe whole of the novads of Kr\u0101slavas.\nIn the novads of Ludza the pagasti of Rund\u0113nu and Istras.\nIn the novads of Zilupe the pagasts of Pasienas.\u2019"}
