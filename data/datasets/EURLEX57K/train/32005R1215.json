Consequently, part of the by-products of the 2004/05 wine year will be distilled in 2005/06. Nevertheless, existing capacity is not yet sufficient to distil all the by-products of both wine years simultaneously.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1990/2004\u00a0(3) authorises Hungary to exempt certain categories of producers from the obligation to distil by-products of wine-making for the 2004/05 wine year. In view of the situation described above, that authorisation should be extended to the 2005/06 marketing year.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1990/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1990/2004, \u2018for the 2004/2005 marketing year\u2019 is hereby replaced by \u2018for the 2004/2005 and 2005/06 marketing years\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
