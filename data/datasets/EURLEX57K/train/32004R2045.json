This permits to authorise intervention bodies to sell by tender higher quantities without prior decision of the Commission, to take into account the market situation in their Member States. To simplify the sales for export, the mention of the storage localisation should not be required in the decision issuing invitations to the tender.\n(3) In Member States which do not have sea ports, tenderers for cereals put up for sale are penalized by higher transport costs. As a result of these additional costs, cereals are more difficult to export from those Member States, which results in particular in longer intervention storage and additional costs to the Community budget. Provision should accordingly be made for the possibility in certain cases of financing the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the place of exit in order to make tenders comparable. The Romanian port of Constanta was a traditional port of exit for the countries of Central Europe before their accession to the Union. It is therefore necessary to include Constanta as a place for the calculation of the transport costs that can be reimbursed in the case of export.\n(4) In order to simplify the procedure for selling the cereals, the security accompanying the tenders for sale for export as well as on the Community market should be unified.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2 (2), \u20182\u00a0000 tonnes\u2019 is replaced by \u20185\u00a0000 tonnes\u2019;\n2. in Article 3(1), the first sentence is replaced by the following sentence:\n3.
