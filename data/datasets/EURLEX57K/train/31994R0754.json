A product known as a graphics or digitzing tablet consisting a flat plastic housing containing electronic and electrical components such as processors, printed circuit board and interfacing circuitry. The uppermost surface, whose active area is approximately 28 cm by 28 cm, is fitted with a menu overlay. The tablet comes with a stylus and is linked via cable direct to the central processing unit of an automatic data-processing machine.\n2. A colour with high-resolution 35,5 cm cathode-ray tube with a shadow mask, dot pitch of 0,31 mm for pixels of the same colour, mains adpater and circuit assemblies for processing RGB video and synchronous input signals (video bandwidth 0 MHz) and driving the picture tube of text and graphics reproduction as part of EDP and other information processing systems. The monitor is not capable of reproducing a colour image from a composite video signal.\n3. A battery-driven modem contained in a housing measuring 10,2 x 6,1 x 2,5 cm in dimension fitted with four LEDs which indicate call status, speed, carrier frequency and battery depletion. The modem also has a data connector, telephone connections, acoustic-coupler connection and standarized miniature telephone jack. The modem is used for asynchronous data transmission between automatic data processing equipment via telephone lines in full duplex and acoustic-coupler mode at a speed of 300 or 1\u00a0200 bits per second.\n4.
