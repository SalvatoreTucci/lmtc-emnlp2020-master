Article 3 (3) is replaced by the following:\n'3. Where the average world market price is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1417/78, the Commission shall determine that price on the basis of the sum of the value of the following products:\n- 15 kilograms of soya cake with a total crude protein content of 44 %,\n- 35 kilograms of corn gluten feed with a total crude protein content of 23 %,\n- 89 kilograms of citrus pellets with a total crude protein content of 6 %,\nthis sum being reduced by the value of 39 kilograms of standard quality barley.\nFor the purposes of determining the value of barley, reference shall be made to an average market price in the deficit areas of the Community.

For the 1987/88 marketing year for dried fodder, this amount shall be 10 ECU per tonne.\nWhere the market situation does not permit the value of the products in question to be determined, the Commission shall replace them by other products having similar characteristics, during at the most two consecutive occasions on which the world market price is fixed. In this case, the quantities of each product to be taken into considerations shall be determined on the basis of the price ratio recorded, during a reference period, between the product referred to in the first subparagraph and the one which replaces it'.\n2.
