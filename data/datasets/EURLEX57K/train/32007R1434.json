For the purpose of this Regulation, certain ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. They can be opened either by pulling the half rings or with a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the ring binder mechanism.\n(4) The products under investigation are certain ring binder mechanisms which are slightly modified originating in the People's Republic of China, normally declared under CN code ex\u00a08305\u00a010\u00a000 (classified previous to the entry into force of this Regulation under TARIC code 8305100090), and certain ring binder mechanisms, whether slightly modified or not, consigned from Thailand, normally declared under CN code ex\u00a08305\u00a010\u00a000 (classified previous to the entry into force of this Regulation under TARIC codes 8305100019, 8305100029 and 8305100090) (\u2018the products under investigation\u2019).\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004\u00a0(2) as extended to imports of the same product consigned from Vietnam\u00a0(3) and from Lao People's Democratic Republic\u00a0(4).\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS\n(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China are being circumvented by means of a slight modification of the product concerned to make it fall under custom codes which are normally not subject to the measures, in particular CN code ex\u00a08305\u00a010\u00a000 (classified previous to the entry into force of this Regulation under TARIC code 8305100090), and that the modification does not alter the essential characteristics of the product concerned. Examples of such slightly modified types are ring binder mechanisms with more than two rectangular steel sheets or wires and/or with chamfered sheets, ring binder mechanisms with two steel sheets the edges of which have been cut off and/or which have indentations so that their shape is no longer rectangular. Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Thailand of the product concerned, whether slightly modified (in the way described above) or not.\n(7) The evidence submitted is as follows:\n\u2014 The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People's Republic of China and Thailand to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.\n\u2014 This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the slight modification of the product concerned and from the transhipment via Thailand of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China, whether slightly modified or not.\n\u2014 Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of the products under investigation appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.\n\u2014 Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the products under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.\n\u2014 Should circumvention practices covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than the ones mentioned above, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(8) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Thailand, whether slightly modified or not and whether declared as originating in Thailand or not, and imports of certain slightly modified ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(c) Exemption of registration of imports or measures\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGISTRATION\n(9) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the products under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 producers in the People's Republic of China and Thailand may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(5).\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(14) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this investigation, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.
