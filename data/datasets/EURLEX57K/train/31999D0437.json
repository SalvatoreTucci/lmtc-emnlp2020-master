FISCHER\nDECLARATIONS\nI. Declaration by the Council\n\"The sole purpose of the list reproduced in Article 1 is to determine the areas with regard to which the further development of the Schengen acquis within the framework of the European Union must comply with the procedures laid down in Article 4 of the Agreement concluded by the Council with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those States with the implementation, application and further development of the Schengen acquis.\nThat list is not a list of the areas constituting the entire Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union and as it is to be applied and implemented by and between the Member States bound by the Schengen agreements. To that end the Schengen acquis was determined by the Council in its Decision of 20 May 1999.\nNor is it a list of the areas constituting the entire Schengen acquis as it is to be applied and implemented by Iceland and Norway and between those States and the Member States bound by the Schengen agreements under Article 2(1) of the aforementioned agreement.\nThe fact of that list's existence cannot, therefore, affect the integrity of the Schengen acquis as referred to in the Annex to the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union.\"\nII. Declaration by the Commission\n\"The Commission wishes to state that in the Mixed Committee it will comply with any common position adopted by the Council.\""}
