Member States, except Italy, have notified the Commission of the division between \u2018deliveries\u2019 and \u2018direct sales\u2019 of the additional quota.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to establish the division between \u2018deliveries\u2019 and \u2018direct sales\u2019 of the national quotas applicable for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 fixed in Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(6) Given the fact that the division between direct sales and deliveries is used as a reference basis for controls pursuant to Articles 19 to 21 of Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 and for the establishment of the annual questionnaire set out in Annex I to that Regulation, it is appropriate to determine a date of expiry of this Regulation after the last possible date for these controls.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The division, applicable for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013, between \u2018deliveries\u2019 and \u2018direct sales\u2019 of the national quotas fixed in Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall expire on 30 September 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 April 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 106, 18.4.2012, p. 11.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 94, 31.3.2004, p. 22.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX\nMember States Deliveries Direct sales\nBelgium 3\u00a0527\u00a0261,237 39\u00a0189,169\nBulgaria 969\u00a0471,860 69\u00a0654,492\nCzech Republic 2\u00a0883\u00a0911,857 22\u00a0172,160\nDenmark 4\u00a0799\u00a0731,619 178,750\nGermany 29\u00a0927\u00a0740,580 91\u00a0000,757\nEstonia 679\u00a0484,295 6\u00a0581,100\nIreland 5\u00a0725\u00a0112,334 2\u00a0038,395\nGreece 869\u00a0588,700 1\u00a0317,000\nSpain 6\u00a0426\u00a0902,352 65\u00a0726,801\nFrance 25\u00a0760\u00a0216,119 349\u00a0913,858\nItaly 10\u00a0936\u00a0833,659 351\u00a0709,207\nCyprus 153\u00a0365,189 752,427\nLatvia 756\u00a0483,140 16\u00a0915,571\nLithuania 1\u00a0734\u00a0582,876 74\u00a0960,670\nLuxembourg 289\u00a0255,752 600,000\nHungary 1\u00a0957\u00a0311,869 154\u00a0969,835\nMalta 51\u00a0688,841 0,000\nNetherlands 11\u00a0852\u00a0077,809 79\u00a0103,038\nAustria 2\u00a0877\u00a0171,506 85\u00a0926,007\nPoland 9\u00a0808\u00a0184,895 148\u00a0049,814\nPortugal\u00a0(1) 2\u00a0059\u00a0790,172 8\u00a0432,151\nRomania 1\u00a0535\u00a0888,932 1\u00a0708\u00a0860,056\nSlovenia 591\u00a0294,484 20\u00a0758,367\nSlovakia 1\u00a0066\u00a0819,790 37\u00a0889,340\nFinland\u00a0(2) 2\u00a0588\u00a0836,146 5\u00a0061,626\nSweden 3\u00a0553\u00a0845,206 4\u00a0600,000\nUnited Kingdom 15\u00a0591\u00a0926,714 147\u00a0384,737\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Except Madeira.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The Finnish national quota as referred to in annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and the total amount of the Finnish national quota as indicated in the Annex to this regulation differ due to a quota increase of 784\u00a0683 tonnes to compensate Finnish SLOM producers pursuant to article 67(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007."}
