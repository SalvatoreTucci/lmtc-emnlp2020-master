For each 60-day period, the following aid shall be granted:\n- ECU 4,5 per 100 kilograms if the storage agency provides evidence, within 60 days following the date of expiry of the contract, that the olive oil has been marketed,\n- ECU 1 per 100 kilograms in all other cases.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation 'marketed' shall mean that the oil has either been sold and delivered to a packaging plant approved pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2677/85 (6) or to a refiner or has been exported.\n3. An amount of ECU 1 per 100 kilograms may be paid in advance on conclusion or renewal of the contract against security for an equivalent amount.\n4. The rate applicable for the conversion into national currency for the amount of the storage aid shall be the agricultural conversion rate in force on the day of conclusion of the contract.\n5. The amount of the aid shall be calculated by reference to the net weight ascertained on the date of commencement of the contract.", "1. Subject to the provisions of Article 7, the aid shall be paid only where all the obligations in the contract have been complied with.\nThe aid shall be paid, and the securities specified in Articles 3 (1) and 5 (3) released after verification of compliance with the said obligations, within 60 days following expiry of the contract.\n2.

Such action may, in particular, involve payment of the aid due pro rata for the quantity stored and the  actual period of storage.\n2. Member States shall inform the Commission of all cases they deem to be cases of force majeure and of the action taken in each case.", "1. The Member States shall take all action necessary to ensure, throughout the contractual storage period, verification of compliance with the obligations laid down in the contract.
