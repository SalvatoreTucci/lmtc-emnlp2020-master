whereas it is appropriate to specify in certain cases which rules of origin should be applied;\nWhereas eligibility for these reduced rates of duty is generally granted within quota limits; whereas it is appropriate to open quotas and specify the detailed rules for implementing these quotas, particularly in order to guarantee equal and continuous access by all Community importers on the one hand and the immediate application, in all Member States, of the charges laid down for the quotas until the quotas are exhausted on the other hand; whereas, in order to ensure effective common administration of such quotas, there is no reason to prevent Member States from being authorized to draw the necessary quantities which correspond to actual imports from the quota volumes; whereas, however, such a method of administration requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission which must, in particular, monitor the rate at which the quota volumes are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of these measures may be carried out by any one of its members;\nWhereas the reductions granted are generally established by reducing the basic amounts used to calculate the agricultural components applicable to certain specific goods; whereas, since tariffs were established during the Uruguay Round negotiations, the agricultural components of the Community Customs Tariff are fixed as they are and no longer according to the quantity of basic products established pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93;\nWhereas in order to calculate the reduced agricultural components, these quantities must be maintained for preferential trade;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 3238/94 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 478/96 (3), provides for the determination and administration of the variable components for certain goods originating in central and eastern European countries resulting from the processing of agricultural products referred to in the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 3448/93; whereas, since the entry into force of this Regulation, the variable components have been replaced by agricultural components fixed in the Community tariff; whereas this Regulation had to be temporarily supplemented by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/95 (4);\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1294/94 of 3 June 1994 on implementing measures of the trade arrangements applicable on imports of certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products (5) is no longer applicable to goods imported outside preferential agreements;\nWhereas reduced agricultural components have been introduced in trade with other third countries; whereas, for reasons of clarity, it is necessary to have a single regulation relating to the specific provisions applicable to trade referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93; whereas Regulations (EC) No 1294/94 and (EC) No 3238/94 must therefore be repealed;\nWhereas Article 6 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 provides that the ad valorem duties corresponding to the agricultural component may be replaced by a specific amount where provided for by a preferential agreement; whereas this amount should not, however, exceed the charge applicable in relation to non-preferential trade;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex II,", "main_body": ["This Regulation establishes the rules for determining the reduced agricultural components referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 and for managing quotas opened pursuant to preferential agreements applicable to goods and products covered by Regulation (EC) No 3448/93.", "For the purposes of establishing the reduced agricultural components, the following basic products shall be considered:\n- common wheat,\n- durum wheat,\n- rye,\n- barley,\n- maize, other than maize for sowing,\n- long grain husked rice, hereinafter referred to as 'rice`,\n- white sugar,\n- molasses,\n- milk powder with a fat content by weight not exceeding 1,5 %, with no sugar or other sweetener added and in immediate packing with a net content greater than 2,5 kg, hereinafter referred to as 'PG 2`,\n- milk powder with a milk fat content by weight of 26 %, with no sugar or other sweetener added and in immediate packing with a net content greater than 2,5 kg, hereinafter referred to as 'PG 3`,\n- butter, with a fat content by weight of 82 %, hereinafter referred to as 'PG 6`.", "The reduced agricultural components covered by this Regulation shall be calculated on the basis of the quantities of basic products considered to have been used in the manufacture of the goods covered by this Regulation.

In cases where the reduced agricultural component and, where necessary, the additional reduced duties, determined pursuant to paragraph 1, would be less than ECU 2,4/100 kg, such a component and/or duty shall be fixed at zero.\n5. The amounts established pursuant to this Article shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
