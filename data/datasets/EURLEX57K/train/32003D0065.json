Under the rules of territoriality, part of the VAT on tolls is payable to Denmark and part to Sweden.\n(4) By way of derogation from the provisions of Article 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC, as amended by Article 28f of that Directive, requiring taxable persons to exercise their right to deduct or obtain a refund of VAT in the Member State where it was paid, the Swedish and Danish authorities were authorised to introduce a special measure enabling taxpayers to recover VAT from a single administration.\n(5) This authorisation expires on 31 December 2002. Since the legal situation and the facts which justified application of the simplification measure in the first place have not changed a Decision should be taken which will apply from 1 January 2003 and which extends the said authorisation.\n(6) On 17 June 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Directive amending the sixth Directive as regards the rules governing the right to deduct value added tax(3), adoption of which would render the special measures unnecessary in all cases where taxable persons established in the Community are involved, which is in fact the majority of cases.\n(7) The extension of the authorisation should therefore be granted for a limited period and remain valid up to the entry into force of the said Directive, or up to 31 December 2006 at the latest if that Directive has not yet entered into force by then.\n(8) The derogation does not aversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Decision 2000/91/EC, the date \"31 December 2002\" shall be replaced by \"31 December 2006\".", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2003.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Sweden."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 January 2003.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nN.
