The absence of the statement referred to in Article 16(1)(b) leads, in turn, to the ineligibility of the validated expenditure for support under the restructuring and conversion scheme.\n(4) Some Member States for which the 2005/2006 wine year is the second year of application of the restructuring and conversion scheme were unable to pay out 75\u00a0% of their initial allocation, though they validated a certain part of it. The difficulties were related to the lack of familiarity with the conditions of the scheme. Application of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 would result in excessive reductions in the appropriations available to those Member States for restructuring and conversion in this financial year.\n(5) Therefore, on a transitional basis, for the 2005/2006 wine year, these excessive reductions are to be avoided, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, by allowing the Member States for which the 2005/2006 wine year is the second year of application of the restructuring and conversion scheme to pay out, by the end of the current financial year, the totality of their appropriations in respect of which the corresponding expenditure was incurred or validated on 30 June 2006.\n(6) A similar solution was applied in 2002 when the vineyard restructuring and conversion scheme was in the second year of application for the old Member States and some of them had problems of the same nature now encountered by some of the Member States for in which the scheme is applied for the second year.\n(7) As this Regulation must apply from 1 July 2006, it should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 and as the 2006 financial year concerns, no conditions apply to the statement referred to in Article 16(1)(b) of that Regulation in the case of Member States for which the 2005/2006 wine year is the second year of application of the restructuring and conversion scheme. They may pay out, not later than 15 October 2006, the sum of the expenditure they reported to the Commission under Article 16(1)(a) and (b) of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
