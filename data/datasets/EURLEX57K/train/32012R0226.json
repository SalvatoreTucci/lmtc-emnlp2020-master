The application was accompanied by the relevant supporting data. The Commission forwarded that application to the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019).\n(3) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 6 September 2011\u00a0(4) that there is no reason to continue to restrict the inclusion of the preparation benzoic acid to compound feed via premixtures. It considered the restrictions on the use of the additive in complementary feed established by Regulation (EC) No 1138/2007 as being sufficient and applicable to weaned piglets.\n(4) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1730/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1730/2006 is replaced by the text of the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 March 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 24.11.2006, p. 9.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 2.10.2007, p. 8.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(9):2358.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
