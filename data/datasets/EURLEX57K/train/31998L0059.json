The completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in the European Community (. . .).\nThe improvement must cover, where necessary, the development of certain aspects of employment regulations such as procedures for collective redundancies and those regarding bankruptcies.\n(. . .)\n17. Information, consultation and participation for workers must be developed along appropriate lines, taking account of the practices in force in the various Member States.\n(. . .)\n18.

For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) 'collective redundancies` means dismissals effected by an employer for one or more reasons not related to the individual workers concerned where, according to the choice of the Member States, the number of redundancies is:\n(i) either, over a period of 30 days:\n- at least 10 in establishments normally employing more than 20 and less than 100 workers,\n- at least 10 % of the number of workers in establishments normally employing at least 100 but less than 300 workers,\n- at least 30 in establishments normally employing 300 workers or more,\n(ii) or, over a period of 90 days, at least 20, whatever the number of workers normally employed in the establishments in question;\n(b) 'workers' representatives` means the workers' representatives provided for by the laws or practices of the Member States.\nFor the purpose of calculating the number of redundancies provided for in the first subparagraph of point (a), terminations of an employment contract which occur on the employer's initiative for one or more reasons not related to the individual workers concerned shall be assimilated to redundancies, provided that there are at least five redundancies.\n2. This Directive shall not apply to:\n(a) collective redundancies effected under contracts of employment concluded for limited periods of time or for specific tasks except where such redundancies take place prior to the date of expiry or the completion of such contracts;\n(b) workers employed by public administrative bodies or by establishments governed by public law (or, in Member States where this concept is unknown, by equivalent bodies);\n(c) the crews of seagoing vessels.\nSECTION II\nInformation and consultation", "1. Where an employer is contemplating collective redundancies, he shall begin consultations with the workers' representatives in good time with a view to reaching an agreement.\n2. These consultations shall, at least, cover ways and means of avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected, and of mitigating the consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures aimed, inter alia, at aid for redeploying or retraining workers made redundant.\nMember States may provide that the workers' representatives may call on the services of experts in accordance with national legislation and/or practice.\n3. To enable workers' representatives to make constructive proposals, the employers shall in good time during the course of the consultations:\n(a) supply them with all relevant information and\n(b) in any event notify them in writing of:\n(i) the reasons for the projected redundancies;\n(ii) the number of categories of workers to be made redundant;\n(iii) the number and categories of workers normally employed;\n(iv) the period over which the projected redundancies are to be effected;\n(v) the criteria proposed for the selection of the workers to be made redundant in so far as national legislation and/or practice confers the power therefor upon the employer;\n(vi) the method for calculating any redundancy payments other than those arising out of national legislation and/or practice.\nThe employer shall forward to the competent public authority a copy of, at least, the elements of the written communication which are provided for in the first subparagraph, point (b), subpoints (i) to (v).\n4. The obligations laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply irrespective of whether the decision regarding collective redundancies is being taken by the employer or by an undertaking controlling the employer.\nIn considering alleged breaches of the information, consultation and notification requirements laid down by this Directive, account shall not be taken of any defence on the part of the employer on the ground that the necessary information has not been provided to the employer by the undertaking which took the decision leading to collective redundancies.\nSECTION III\nProcedure for collective redundances", "1. Employers shall notify the competent public authority in writing of any projected collective redundancies.\nHowever, Member States may provide that in the case of planned collective redundancies arising from termination of the establishment's activities as a result of a judicial decision, the employer shall be obliged to notify the competent public authority in writing only if the latter so requests.\nThis notification shall contain all relevant information concerning the projected collective redundancies and the consultations with workers' representatives provided for in Article 2, and particularly the reasons for the redundancies, the number of workers to be made redundant, the number of workers normally employed and the period over which the redundancies are to be effected.\n2. Employers shall forward to the workers' representatives a copy of the notification provided for in paragraph 1.\nThe workers' representatives may send any comments they may have to the competent public authority.", "1. Projected collective redundancies notified to the competent public authority shall take effect not earlier than 30 days after the notification referred to in Article 3(1) without prejudice to any provisions governing individual rights with regard to notice of dismissal.\nMember States may grant the competent public authority the power to reduce the period provided for in the preceding subparagraph.\n2. The period provided for in paragraph 1 shall be used by the competent public authority to seek solutions to the problems raised by the projected collective redundancies.\n3. Where the initial period provided for in paragraph 1 is shorter than 60 days, Member States may grant the competent public authority the power to extend the initial period to 60 days following notification where the problems raised by the projected collective redundancies are not likely to be solved within the initial period.\nMember States may grant the competent public authority wider powers of extension.\nThe employer must be informed of the extension and the grounds for it before expiry of the initial period provided for in paragraph 1.\n4. Member States need not apply this Article to collective redundancies arising from termination of the establishment's activities where this is the result of a judicial decision.\nSECTION IV\nFinal provisions", "This Directive shall not affect the right of Member States to apply or to introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to workers or to promote or to allow the application of collective agreements more favourable to workers.", "Member States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive are available to the workers' representatives and/or workers.", "Member States shall forward to the Commission the text of any fundamental provisions of national law already adopted or being adopted in the area governed by this Directive.", "1. The Directives listed in Annex I, Part A, are hereby repealed without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the deadlines for transposition of the said Directive set out in Annex I, Part B.\n2.
