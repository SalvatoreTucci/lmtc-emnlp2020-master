Furthermore, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 of 20 November 2002 extending the time period referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to that Directive and the withdrawal of authorisation for plant protection products containing these substances(9), nonylphenol ethoxylate has been excluded from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and authorisations for plant protection products containing it were to be withdrawn by 25 July 2003. Accordingly, both chemicals should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003.\n(5) At its 10th session from 17 to 21 November 2003, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) for the Convention decided that the chemicals DNOC and the asbestos fibres amosite, antophyllite, actinolite and tremolite should also be subject to the interim PIC procedure. Accordingly, these substances should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 and the existing entries in Parts 1 and 2 should be amended.\n(6) At the same session, the INC decided that the dustable powder formulations containing a combination of benomyl at or above 7 per cent, carbofuran at or above 10 per cent and thiram at or above 15 per cent should also become subject to the interim PIC procedure. Accordingly such formulations should also be added to the list of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003.\n(7) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 29 of Council Directive 67/548/EEC(10),", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 April 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u0e23\u0e16m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, p. 1.
