Furthermore, EFSA reiterated the previous conclusions that 1507 maize is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed uses. This includes the use of feed produced from maize line 1507\u00a0(4).\n(5) In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 18(4) of that Regulation.\n(6) By letter of 21 January 2010, the applicant confirmed that he is aware of the fact that renewing the authorisation of existing feed produced from maize line 1507 by extending the scope of Decision 2006/197/EC so as to include such product, would imply this category of products to be subject to the legal provisions of that Decision.\n(7) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for feed produced from maize line 1507.\n(8) The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the feed, as provided for in point (e) of Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01829/2003.\n(9) For the sake of transparency, the applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.\n(10) Taking into account these considerations, renewal of the authorisation to place on the market existing feed produced from maize line 1507 should be granted.\n(11) Since it is general practice to authorise the placing on the market of food and feed in the same decision, the renewal of the authorisation to place on the market feed produced from maize line 1507 should be included in Decision 2006/197/EC. Decision 2006/197/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chair and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since, at its meeting on 17 March 2011, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal and the Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded, these measures are to be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDecision 2006/197/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) the title is replaced by the following:\n(2) Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Decision 2006/197/EC are replaced by the following:\n(3) the Annex is amended as follows:\n(a) Section (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) Designation and specification of the products:\n(i) foods and food ingredients containing, consisting of, or produced from DAS-\u00d815\u00d87-1 maize;\n(ii) feed produced from DAS-\u00d815\u00d87-1 maize.\n(b) Section (c) is replaced by the following:\nNo specific requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01829/2003.\nFor the purpose of Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the \u201cname of organism\u201d shall be \u201cmaize\u201d.\u2019.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to:\n(a) Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Avenue des Arts 44, 1040 Brussels, Belgium; and\n(b) Dow AgroSciences Europe, European Development Centre, 3 Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN, United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 June 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 9.3.2006, p. 82.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA opinions published on:\n\u2014 24 September 2004 for the placing on the market of maize 1507 for import and processing;\n\u2014 19 January 2005 for the placing on the market of maize 1507 for import, feed and industrial processing and cultivation;\n\u2014 19 January 2005 for the placing on the market of maize 1507 for food use;\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://registerofquestions.efsa.europa.eu/roqFrontend/questionLoader?question = EFSA-Q-2007-144"}
