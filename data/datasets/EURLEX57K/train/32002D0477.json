Article 17(2)(c) of that Directive provides that the fresh meat must have been treated according to the hygiene conditions in accordance with Council Directive 64/433/EEC(11). Article 4 provides for the drawing up of lists of establishments, the compliance of which with the provisions of the Directive and with the hygiene conditions required under Directive 64/433/EEC is to be assessed according to criteria provided for under paragraph 2 of the same Article, and which may by amended or supplemented by the Commission in line with the result of the inspections provided for in Article 5.\n(9) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification requirements for the importation of fresh meat from a number of countries, have been established on the basis of Article 16 of Directive 72/462/EEC in a number of Commission Decisions which should be recast in a near future; by that time, it shall be appropriate to introduce into the attestation of health included in the model certificates, the same public health attestation as introduced by the present Decision for fresh poultrymeat.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["When considering whether a given third country fulfils the criteria set out in Article 15 of Directive 71/118/EEC and Article 3(2) of Directive 72/462/EEC in order to be included on the list drawn up in accordance with those Directives, the Commission shall take into account the rules of that third country with regard to the implementation of regular checks on the general hygiene, based on hazard analysis and critical control points principles and on microbiological controls as necessary, carried out by operators exporting fresh poultrymeat or fresh meat to the Community.", "When inspections are carried out pursuant to Directive 71/118/EEC and Directive 72/462/EEC in order to determine whether an establishment complies with the provisions of those Directives and of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC and may therefore be included in the list provided for in Article 14(B)(2) of Directive 71/118/EEC and Article 4(1) of Directive 72/462/EEC, implementation by the operators concerned of the requirements of Decision 2001/471/EC shall be taken into account.", "Decision 94/984/EC is amended as follow:\n1.
