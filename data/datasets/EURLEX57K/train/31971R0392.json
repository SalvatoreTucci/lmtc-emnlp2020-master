Vinimpex, according to agreed terms and conditions;\nWhereas the said authorities will ensure that deliveries of the products in question are not made at free-at-Community-frontier prices which are lower than the reference prices, less customs duties, valid on the day of customs clearance, and that any deflection of trade will be avoided ; whereas to that end they will take all necessary steps to prevent action which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the reference prices less customs duties, such as taking over marketing costs, resorting to linked transactions or any other action having similar effect;\nWhereas Vinimpex undertakes to communicate regularly to the Commission details of wine exports to the Community and to enable the Commission to exercise continuous supervision of the effectiveness of the measures it has taken;\nWhereas questions affecting observance of the guarantee given have been discussed in detail with the competent authorities of the People's Republic of Bulgaria ; whereas, following those discussions, it may be assumed that the People's Republic of Bulgaria is in a position to abide by its guarantee ; whereas, consequently, there is no need to levy a countervailing charge on imports of the above-mentioned products originating in and coming from Bulgaria ; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2223/70 3 of 28 October 1970 waiving the countervailing charge on imports of certain wines originating in and coming from certain third countries should therefore be supplemented accordingly;\nWhereas, moreover, it is necessary to make certain corrections to parts of the preamble to that Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Wine;  1OJ No L 99, 5.5.1970, p. 1. 2OJ No L 281, 27.12.1970, p. 6. 3OJ No L 241, 4.11.1970, p. 3.", "main_body": ["1.
