In a first phase, such detailed rules should be limited to the following impediments:\n\u2014 use precluded by the prior right of a third party,\n\u2014 difficulties as regards recognition or reproduction,\n\u2014 denominations which are identical or may be confused with a variety denomination of another variety,\n\u2014 denominations which are identical or may be confused with other designations,\n\u2014 misleading or causing confusion concerning the characteristics of the variety or other features.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["This Regulation establishes, for the purposes of the application of the first subparagraph of Article 9(6) of Directive 2002/53/EC and of the first subparagraph of Article 9(6) of Directive 2002/55/EC, detailed rules for the application of certain criteria set out in Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 for the eligibility of variety denominations.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a trade mark as a prior right of a third party, the use of a variety denomination in the territory of the Community shall be considered to be precluded by the notification to the competent authority for the approval of the variety denomination of a trade mark, which has been registered in one or more Member States or at Community level prior to the approval of the variety denomination, and which is identical or similar to the variety denomination and registered in relation to goods which are identical or similar to the plant variety concerned.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a geographical indication or a designation of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs as a prior right of a third party, a variety denomination in the territory of the Community shall be considered to be precluded where the variety denomination would breach Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006\u00a0(6) with respect to the geographical indication or the designation of origin protected in a Member State or in the Community under Article 3(3), the second subparagraph of Article 5(4), Article 5(6), Article 6 and Article 7(4) of that Regulation or the former Article 17 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92\u00a0(7) for goods which are identical or similar to the plant variety concerned.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An impediment to the suitability of a denomination due to a prior right referred to in paragraph 2 may be removed where a written consent of the holder of the prior right to the use of the denomination in relation to the variety has been obtained, provided that such a consent is not liable to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a prior right of the applicant in respect of whole or part of the proposed denomination, Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 shall apply mutatis mutandis.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A variety denomination shall be considered to cause its users difficulties as regards recognition or reproduction in the following cases:\n(a) where it is in the form of a \u2018fancy name\u2019:\n(i) it consists of a single letter;\n(ii) it consists of, or contains as a separate element, a series of letters not forming a word pronounceable in an official language of the Community;
