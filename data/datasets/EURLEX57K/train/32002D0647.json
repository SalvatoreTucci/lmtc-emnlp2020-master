In urgent cases, and where the measures to be adopted must be applied immediately, the Chair may, at the request of a Committee member or on his/her own initiative, shorten the period laid down in paragraph 1 to six working days before the date of the meeting.\n3. By way of exception, in duly substantiated cases of extreme urgency (e.g. serious economic, social and political circumstances, natural disasters suffered by the recipient country or other circumstances requiring a very rapid reaction), the Chair may depart from the periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.
