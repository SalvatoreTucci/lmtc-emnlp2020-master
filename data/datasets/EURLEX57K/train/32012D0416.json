The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. That tolerance is defined in Article 23(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(2).\n(2) By Decision 97/107/EC\u00a0(3), the Commission authorised the use of five methods for grading pig carcasses in Belgium.\n(3) Due to changes in the pig population, the formulae used with these methods are currently underestimating the lean meat content. It is therefore necessary to update the formula of the authorised methods and to obtain and use three new grading methods.\n(4) Belgium has requested the Commission to authorise eight methods for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which those methods are based, the results of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01249/2008.\n(5) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those grading methods are fulfilled. Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in Belgium.\n(6) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Implementing Decision.\n(7) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, Decision 97/107/EC should be repealed.\n(8) In view of the technical circumstances while introducing new devices and new equations, the methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under Decision 97/107/EC should continue to apply up to 30 September 2012.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is authorised for grading pig carcasses pursuant to point 1 of Section B.IV of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007 in Belgium:\n(a) the \u2018Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex;\n(b) the \u2018Giralda Choirometer Pork Grader (PG 200)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex;\n(c) the \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex;\n(d) the \u2018Fat-O-Meat\u2019er (FOM II)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 4 of the Annex;\n(e) the \u2018OptiScan TP\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 5 of the Annex;\n(f) the \u2018CSB Image-Meater\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 6 of the Annex;\n(g) the \u2018VCS 2000\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 7 of the Annex;\n(h) the \u2018AutoFOM III\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 8 of the Annex.", "Modifications of the authorised apparatus or assessment methods shall not be allowed, unless those modifications are explicitly authorised by Commission Implementing Decision.", "Decision 97/107/EC is repealed.\nHowever, up to 30 September 2012, Belgium may continue to apply the methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under Decision 97/107/EC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u0218\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 16.12.2008, p.\u00a03.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a039, 8.2.1997, p.\u00a017.\nANNEX\nMETHODS FOR GRADING PIG CARCASSES IN BELGIUM\nPART 1\nCapteur gras/maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\n1.
