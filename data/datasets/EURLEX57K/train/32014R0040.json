The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019, for a scientific assessment, as well as to the Commission and the Member States for information.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) In order to stimulate innovation, health claims which are based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or which include a request for the protection of proprietary data shall undergo an accelerated type of authorisation.\n(6) Following an application from Nordic Sugar A/S, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of sugar beet fibre on the increase of faecal bulk (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00972)\u00a0(3). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Sugar beet fibre increases faecal bulk\u2019.\n(7) On 8 December 2011, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of sugar beet fibre and the claimed effect. Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims, established by Regulation (EU) No 432/2012.\n(8) One of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is to ensure that health claims are truthful, clear and reliable and useful to the consumer, and that the wording and the presentation are taken into account in that respect. Therefore, where the wording of claims used by the applicant has the same meaning for consumers as that of an authorised health claim, because they demonstrate the same relationship that exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health, they should be subject to the same conditions of use as those listed in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(9) In accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Register of nutrition and health claims containing all authorised health claims should be updated in order to take into account this Regulation.\n(10) Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The Member States have been consulted,", "main_body": ["The health claim set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall be included in the Union list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children\u2019s development and health (OJ L 136, 25.5.2012, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011;9(12):2468.\nANNEX\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 432/2012, the following entry is inserted in an alphabetical order:\nNutrient, substance, food or food category Claim Conditions of use of the claim Conditions and/or restrictions of use of the food and/or additional statement or warning EFSA Journal number Relevant entry number in the Consolidated List submitted to EFSA for its assessment\n\u2018Sugar beet fibre Sugar beet fibre contributes to an increase in faecal bulk The claim may be used only for food which is high in that fibre as referred to in the claim HIGH FIBRE as listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.  2011;9(12):2468\u2019"}
