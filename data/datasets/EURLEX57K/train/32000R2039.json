Since 1996 the HCFC market has changed considerably with respect to importers and the maintenance of 1996 would result in a large number of importers being deprived of their import quota. As a general rule, quotas should be based on the most recent and representative figures available, in this case those for 1999, and so the maintenance of 1996 could be considered arbitrary and might even result in a breach of the principles of non-discrimination and legitimate expectations.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 4(3)(i)(h) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 the words \"its percentage market share in 1996\" shall be replaced by \"the percentage share assigned to it in 1999\".", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 September 2000.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nN.
