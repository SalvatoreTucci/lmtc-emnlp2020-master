Moreover, Lithuania has intervention stocks of common wheat, outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of. Sales on the Community market may therefore be organised by tendering procedure with a view to processing the common wheat into flour.\n(3) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(4) To enable checks on the particular destination of the stocks covered by tendering procedures, provision should be made for specific monitoring of the delivery of the common wheat and its processing into flour. To permit this monitoring, application of the procedures laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention\u00a0(3), should be made compulsory.\n(5) To guarantee proper performance, tenderers should be asked to lodge a security which, in view of the nature of the operations concerned, should be fixed by derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, in particular as regards its level, which must be sufficient to guarantee the proper use of the products, and the conditions for its release, which must include proof of processing of the products into flour.\n(6) It is also important that the Lithuanian intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The Lithuanian intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 32\u00a0000 tonnes of common wheat held by it with a view to its processing into flour.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding:\n(a) Article 13(1) of that Regulation, tenders shall be drawn up by reference to the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the second paragraph of Article 10 of that Regulation, the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.", "Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by:\n(a) proof that the tenderer has lodged a security which, notwithstanding the second subparagraph of Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, is set at EUR\u00a010 per tonne;\n(b) the tenderer\u2019s written undertaking to use the common wheat for processing within the Community into flour within 60 days of its release from intervention storage and in any event before 31 August 2006 and to lodge a security of EUR 40 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received;\n(c) an undertaking to keep stock records so that checks may be carried out to ensure that the quantities of common wheat awarded have been processed on Community territory into flour.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 23 November 2005.\nThe closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Wednesday at 15.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 28 December 2005, 12 April 2006 and 24 May 2006, i.e. weeks when no invitation to tender shall be made.\nThe closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial invitation to tender shall be 28 June 2006 at 15.00 (Brussels time).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders must be lodged with the Lithuanian intervention agency at the following address:\nThe Lithuanian Agricultural and Food Products Market regulation Agency\nL.
