To allow this trade to continue, the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss market and export prices in the Member States.\n(8) In the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80, the Community share of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present available.\n(9) In the case of other beef and veal products, a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant.\n(10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2849/2000(9), establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds.\n(11) In order to simplify customs export formalities for operators, the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought into line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.\n(12) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83(11).\n(13) Refunds on female animals should vary depending on their age in order to prevent abuses in the export of certain pure-bred breeding animals.\n(14) Opportunities exist for the export to certain third countries of heifers other than those intended for slaughter, but to prevent any abuse control criteria should be laid down to ensure that these animals are not more than 36 months old.\n(15) Under Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
