Since the replacement of Directive 91/414/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, these substances are deemed to have been approved under that Regulation and are listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances\u00a0(5).\n(2) In accordance with Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, presented to the Commission the conclusions on the peer review for blood meal\u00a0(6) on 26 September 2011 for calcium carbide\u00a0(7) on 17 October 2011, for calcium carbonate\u00a0(8) and for limestone\u00a0(9) on 6 July 2011, for pepper dust extraction residue\u00a0(10) on 4 July 2011, and for quartz sand\u00a0(11) on 6\u00a0July 2011. The draft assessment reports and the conclusions of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 9 March 2012 in the format of the Commission review reports for blood meal, calcium carbide, calcium carbonate, limestone, pepper dust extraction residue and quartz sand.\n(3) In accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Commission invited the notifiers to submit their comments on the conclusions of the Authority. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 13(1) of that Regulation, the Commission invited the notifiers to submit comments on the draft review reports for blood meal, calcium carbide, calcium carbonate, limestone, pepper dust extraction residue and quartz sand. The notifiers submitted their comments, which have been carefully examined.\n(4) It is confirmed that the active substances blood meal, calcium carbide, calcium carbonate, limestone, pepper and quartz sand are to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(5) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to amend the conditions of approval of blood meal, calcium carbide, calcium carbonate, limestone, pepper and quartz sand. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information as regards blood meal, calcium carbonate and pepper. At the same time certain technical adaptations should be made, in particular the name of the active substance \u2018pepper\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018pepper dust extraction residue\u2018.\n(6) The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) A reasonable period of time should be allowed before the application of this Regulation in order to allow Member States, notifiers and holders of authorisations for plant protection products to meet the requirements resulting from amendment to the conditions of the approval.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p. 89.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L. 379, 24.12.2004, p. 13.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance blood meal.
