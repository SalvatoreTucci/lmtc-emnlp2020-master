According to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 fresh meat intended for human consumption can only be imported if it comes from a territory of a third country or a part thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Regulation and meets the relevant requirements.\n(2) Japan requested to be listed for the import of fresh bovine meat into the Union and the Commission audit on bovine meat in Japan in 2008 confirmed that the requirements were met. The listing was, however, postponed when foot-and-mouth disease occurred in Japan in 2010.\n(3) Since then Japan eradicated the foot-and-mouth disease on its territory and was recognised as \u2018free without vaccination\u2019 for this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n(4) Japan thus provides sufficient animal health guarantees and has asked again to be included in the list of third countries authorised for the import of fresh bovine meat into the Union.\n(5) Japan should thus be allowed to import fresh bovine meat into the Union.\n(6) Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, the following entry for Japan is inserted after the entry for Iceland:\nISO code and name of third country Code of Territory Description of third country, territory or part thereof Veterinary certificate Specific conditions Closing date\u00a0(3) Opening date\u00a0(4)\nModel(s) SG\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\u2018JP \u2014 Japan JP Whole country BOV    28 March 2013\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 20.3.2010, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Meat from animals slaughtered on or before the date set out in column 7 may be imported into the Union for 90 days from that date.
