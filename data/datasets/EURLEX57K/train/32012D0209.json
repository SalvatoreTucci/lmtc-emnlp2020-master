That Implementing Decision submits all products falling within CN code 3811 to the control and movement provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC\u00a0(3).\n(2) In line with the request made by the Authorities of the Netherlands, the intention of Implementing Decision 2011/545/EU is to prevent tax evasion, avoidance and abuse, by submitting to the control and movement provisions of Directive 2008/118/EC certain products intended to be used as additives for motor fuels and which, in this case, are subject to taxation in accordance with Directive 2003/96/EC.\n(3) Following the adoption of Implementing Decision 2011/545/EU, the Commission\u2019s attention has been drawn to the particular position of products falling within CN codes 3811\u00a021\u00a000 and 3811\u00a029\u00a000. Those products are neither intended to be used as heating fuels or motor fuels, nor as additives thereto and do not give rise to a risk of tax evasion, avoidance or abuse. They should thus not be made subject to the control and movement provisions of Directive 2008/118/EC. Only products falling within CN codes 3811\u00a011\u00a010, 3811\u00a011\u00a090, 3811\u00a019\u00a000 and 3811\u00a090\u00a000 should thus be made subject to those control and movement provisions.\n(4) Implementing Decision 2011/545/EU should therefore be replaced by an analogous Decision, which should however be limited to CN codes 3811\u00a011\u00a010, 3811\u00a011\u00a090, 3811\u00a019\u00a000 and 3811\u00a090\u00a000.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Excise Duty,", "main_body": ["As from 1 January 2013, products falling within CN codes 3811\u00a011\u00a010, 3811\u00a011\u00a090, 3811\u00a019\u00a000 and 3811\u00a090\u00a000 of Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02658/87\u00a0(4) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02031/2001\u00a0(5) shall be subject to the control and movement provisions of Directive 2008/118/EC, in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC.", "Implementing Decision 2011/545/EU is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 283, 31.10.2003, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 241, 17.9.2011, p. 33.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 9, 14.1.2009, p. 12.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 279, 23.10.2001, p. 1."}
