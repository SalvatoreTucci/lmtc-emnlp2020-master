To allow for that, the safeguard clause in Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 needs to be strengthened.\n(4) The temporary introduction of goods from the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control into the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control should be regulated, in order to encourage the provision of services by companies established in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control across the line and in order to facilitate participation by those companies in trade fairs or similar events in areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control. Furthermore, goods destined to be repaired in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control should be allowed to cross the line.\n(5) Reasonable evidence should be provided that the introduction of such goods is effected on a temporary basis.
