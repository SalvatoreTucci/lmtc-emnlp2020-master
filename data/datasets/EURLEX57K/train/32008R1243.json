That Annex sets out specifications for the protein content and source and the processing of protein used in the manufacture of such infant formulae manufactured from hydrolysates of whey proteins derived from cows\u2032 milk protein.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1609/2006 of 27 October 2006 authorising the placing on the market of infant formulae based on hydrolysates of whey protein derived from cows\u2032 milk protein for a two-year period\u00a0(3) authorises the placing on the market of infant formulae based on hydrolysates of cows\u2032 milk in accordance with specifications for the protein content, source, processing and quality set out in the Annex thereto. That authorisation expires on 27 October 2008.\n(6) Directive 2006/141/EC provides on a permanent basis for the authorisation laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1609/2006. Annex VI to Directive 2006/141/EC set out the specifications for the protein content, protein source and protein processing for the infant formulae in question. However, the particular compositional requirements relating to the protein quality were not included in that Annex. The absence of such requirements would prevent the placing on the market of infant formulae manufactured from protein hydrolysates following the expiry of Regulation (EC) No 1609/2006.\n(7) The missing specifications concerning protein quality, which were included in the authorisation laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1609/2006, should be added to Annex VI to Directive 2006/141/EC. That Annex should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In order to avoid any disruption on the market for infant formulae, this Regulation should apply from 28 October 2008.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes III and VI to Directive 2006/141/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 28 October 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 186, 30.6.1989, p. 27.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 401, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 28.10.2006, p. 9.\nANNEX\nAnnexes III and VI to Directive 2006/141/EC are amended as follows:\n1.
