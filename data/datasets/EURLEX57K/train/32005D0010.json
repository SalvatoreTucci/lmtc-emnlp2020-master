A DIVA strategy was applied by using a heterologous vaccine of H7N1 subtype, which allows differentiation between infected and vaccinated poultry. Since September 2003, no further virus circulation of the field strain has been detected.\n(2) Under Commission Decision 2004/666/EC of 29 September 2004 on introducing vaccination to supplement the measures to control infections with low pathogenic avian influenza in Italy and on specific movement control measures and repealing 2002/975/EC\u00a0(6), a new vaccination programme was approved in a smaller area of Italy compared to the previous vaccination campaign under Decision 2002/975/EC. That new programme is carried out with a bivalent vaccine containing both avian influenza subtypes H5 and H7. A prohibition on intra-Community trade in live poultry and hatching eggs apply in the vaccination area and conditions for intra-Community trade in fresh meat originating from vaccinated poultry have been laid down in that Decision.\n(3) Since mid September 2004, there is evidence that low pathogenic avian influenza of the same subtype H7N3 has been reoccurring in the areas of Italy previously affected.\n(4) Although up to present time the infections seem to be contained within a defined area under the restrictions provided for in Decision 2004/666/EC, it appears appropriate to reintroduce vaccination in bordering areas to prevent possible further spread of the disease. In addition, it is appropriate to extend the restrictive measures provided for in that Decision.\n(5) Due to vaccine availability, the vaccination campaign should be carried out with a monovalent vaccine suitable to protect against the current infections with subtype H7N3.\n(6) In addition, the health marking to be applied for fresh poultry meat not intended for intra-Community trade nor for dispatch to third countries, as provided for in Decision 2004/666/EC, should be amended to facilitate national use.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/666/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
