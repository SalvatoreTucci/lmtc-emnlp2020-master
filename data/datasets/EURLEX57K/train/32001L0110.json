In view of the close link between the quality of honey and its origin, it is indispensable that full information on those matters be available so that the consumer is not misled regarding the quality of the product. The particular consumer interests as regards the geographical characteristics of honey and full transparency in this regard necessitate that the country of origin where the honey has been harvested should be included in the labelling.\n(6) No pollen or other individual ingredient of honey is to be removed, unless that is inevitable when organic and inorganic foreign materials are removed. That process may be carried out by filtering. Where such filtering leads to the removal of a significant quantity of pollen, the consumer must be correctly informed to that effect by means of an appropriate indication on the label.\n(7) Honey the name of which includes indications concerning floral, vegetable, regional, territorial or topographical origin or specific quality criteria may not have filtered honey added to it. So that the transparency of the market may be improved, the labelling of filtered honeys and baker's honeys must be mandatory for every transaction on the bulk market.\n(8) As the Commission stressed in its communication to the European Parliament and the Council of 24 June 1994 on European apiculture, the Commission may adopt methods of analysis to ensure compliance with the compositional characteristics and additional specific statements for all honey marketed in the Community.\n(9) It is desirable to take account of the work achieved on a new Codex standard for honey, adjusted, as appropriate, to the specific requirements of the Community.\n(10) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of laying down common definitions and rules for the products concerned and bringing the provisions into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the nature of this Directive, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the said objective.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).\n(12) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,", "main_body": ["This Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.

Honey is the natural sweet substance produced by Apis mellifera bees from the nectar of plants or from secretions of living parts of plants or excretions of plant-sucking insects on the living parts of plants, which the bees collect, transform by combining with specific substances of their own, deposit, dehydrate, store and leave in honeycombs to ripen and mature.\n2. The main types of honey are as follows:\n(a) according to origin:\n(i) blossom honey or nectar honey\nHoney obtained from the nectar of plants;\n(ii) honeydew honey\nHoney obtained mainly from excretions of plant sucking insects (Hemiptera) on the living part of plants or secretions of living parts of plants;\n(b) according to mode of production and/or presentation:\n(iii) comb honey\nHoney stored by bees in the cells of freshly built broodless combs or thin comb foundation sheets made solely of beeswax and sold in sealed whole combs or sections of such combs;\n(iv) chunk honey or cut comb in honey\nHoney which contains one or more pieces of comb honey;\n(v) drained honey\nHoney obtained by draining decapped broodless combs;\n(vi) extracted honey\nHoney obtained by centrifuging decapped broodless combs;\n(vii) pressed honey\nHoney obtained by pressing broodless combs with or without the application of moderate heat not exceeding 45 \u00c2\u00b0C;\n(viii) filtered honey\nHoney obtained by removing foreign inorganic or organic matter in such a way as to result in the significant removal of pollen.\n3. Baker's honey\nHoney which is (a) suitable for industrial uses or as an ingredient in other foodstuffs which are then processed and (b) may:\n- have a foreign taste or odour, or\n- have begun to ferment or have fermented, or\n- have been overheated.\nANNEX II\nCOMPOSITION CRITERIA FOR HONEY\nHoney consists essentially of different sugars, predominantly fructose and glucose as well as other substances such as organic acids, enzymes and solid particles derived from honey collection. The colour of honey varies from nearly colourless to dark brown. The consistency can be fluid, viscous or partly to entirely crystallised. The flavour and aroma vary, but are derived from the plant origin.\nWhen placed on the market as honey or used in any product intended for human consumption, honey shall not have added to it any food ingredient, including food additives, nor shall any other additions be made other than honey. Honey must, as far as possible, be free from organic or inorganic matters foreign to its composition. With the exception of point 3 of Annex I, it must not have any foreign tastes or odours, have begun to ferment, have an artificially changed acidity or have been heated in such a way that the natural enzymes have been either destroyed or significantly inactivated.\nWithout prejudice to Annex I, point 2(b)(viii), no pollen or constituent particular to honey may be removed except where this is unavoidable in the removal of foreign inorganic or organic matter.\nWhen placed on the market as honey or used in any product intended for human consumption, honey must meet the following composition criteria:\n1. Sugar content\n1.1. Fructose and glucose content (sum of both)\n>TABLE>\n1.2. Sucrose content\n>TABLE>\n2. Moisture content\n>TABLE>\n3. Water-insoluble content\n>TABLE>\n4.
