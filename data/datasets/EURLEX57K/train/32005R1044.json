For the sake of consistency and transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the beneficiaries, the operative event should be a date that is as close as possible to the beginning of the payment period introduced under the abovementioned Regulation, and as a way of simplifying checks on the application of the exchange rates and making them more effective, it should precede the beginning of the budget year during which the payments are to be made.\n(3) As a consequence, the operative event for the exchange rate for all aid measures under Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be set uniformly by amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture\u00a0(3), and all existing provisions on operative events in the Regulations implementing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should accordingly be repealed.\n(4) In order to inform operators of the amendments to the Regulations in sufficient time before payments start, this Regulation should apply from 1 August 2005.\n(5) Lastly, as some operative events for 2005 have already been set as a date prior to 1 August 2005, as a transitional measure those operative events should remain applicable for 2005.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 of 29 October 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the support schemes provided for in Titles IV and IVa of that Regulation and the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials\u00a0(4) should therefore be amended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant Management Committees,", "main_body": ["Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n2. paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:", "Article 21(3) and Articles 86 and 128 of Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 concerning the determination of the operative event for the exchange rate and/or the rules for calculating the exchange rate for aid for starch potatoes, the premiums for sheep and goats and payments involving beef are hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2005.
