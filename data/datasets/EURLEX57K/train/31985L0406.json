This site, up to and including the vertical projection  of the microphone positions, shall be of concrete or non-porous asphalt. Skid-mounted compressors  shall be placed on supports 0,40 m high unless otherwise required by the manufacturer's conditions  of installation.6.4.1.Measuring surface, measuring distancePoint 6.4.1 shall be reworded as  follows:The measuring surface to be used for the test shall be a hemisphere.The radius shall be:4  m, where the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is not more than 1,5 m,10 m, where  the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is more than 1,5 m but not more\nthan 4 m,16  m, where the greatest dimension of the compressor to be tested is more than 4  m.6.4.2.1.GeneralPoint 6.4.2.1 shall be reworded as follows:For measurements there shall be six  measuring points, i.e. point 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, arranged as defined in section 6.4.2.2 of Annex  I to Directive 79/113/EEC.For testing the compressor, the geometric centre of the compressor shall  be positioned vertically above the centre of the hemisphere.The x axis of the set of coordinates,  in relation to which the positions of the measuring points are fixed, shall be parallel to the main  axis of the compressor.A new point 12 shall be added, worded as follows:12.A METHOD FOR MEASURING  THE AIR VOLUME FLOW RATE OF AIR COMPRESSORS BY MEANS OF CIRCULAR ARC VENTURI NOZZLES UNDER CRITICAL  FLOW CONDITIONS12.1.GeneralThe purpose of this Annex is to provide a simple, quick and economical  method for measuring the flow rate of air compressors.This method has an accuracy of \u00b1 2,5  %.12.2.Test arrangementThe nozzle diameter is to be chosen so as to ensure that the pressure ratio  across the nozzle produces sonic velocity in the throat.The nozzle is to be inserted in a pipe with  a diameter equal to or greater than four times the nozzle throat diameter. Upstream of the nozzle  shall be a length of pipe equal to at least two pipe diameters, in the wall of which are fitted  means for measuring the pressure and temperature of the air flowing through the pipe. At the  upstream end of this pipe, a flow straightener shall be fitted consisting of two perforated plates  mounted one pipe diameter apart. See Figures 1 and 2.Downstream of the nozzle a pipe and silencer  can be fitted provided the pressure drop across this downstream piping does not invalidate the  critical flow conditions across the nozzle.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n>END OF GRAPHIC>\n12.3.Circular arc  venturi\nThe design shall be as shown in Figure 3, the internal surfaces shall be polished and the  throat diameter measured accurately.

On the basis of test results  and for the accuracy stipulated, CD = 0,9888.When used at the discharge of portable or packaged air  compressors, tn will vary from 20 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C and PN from 2 to 8 bar. C* will therefore vary from  0,6871 to 0,6852 and an average value of 0,6862 can be used.
