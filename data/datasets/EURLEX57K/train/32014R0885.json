These results provide evidence that the import of these foods constitutes a risk for human health. No improvement of the situation could be observed after this period of increased frequency of controls at Union borders. Furthermore, no concrete and satisfactory action plan to remediate the shortcomings and deficiencies in the production and control systems was received from the Indian authorities, despite the explicit request from the European Commission.\n(5) To protect human health in the Union, it was necessary to provide for additional guarantees in relation to those food from India. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 91/2013\u00a0(4) therefore provided that all consignments of curry leaves and okra from India should therefore be accompanied by a certificate stating that the products have been sampled and analysed for the presence of pesticide residues and have been found compliant with Union legislation.\n(6) To ensure an efficient organisation and a degree of uniformity at the Union level of the controls at import on the presence of aflatoxins in certain feed and food from certain third countries, it is appropriate to have all feed and food from third countries subject to specific conditions because of the presence of aflatoxins into one Regulation. Therefore the provisions as regards groundnuts from India and Ghana and watermelon seeds from Nigeria should be integrated into one Regulation with the provisions foreseen in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1152/2009\u00a0(5).\n(7) In order to ensure an efficient organisation and a degree of uniformity at the Union level of the controls at import, it is appropriate to provide in this Regulation for control procedures for the physical control on pesticide residues on curry leaves and okra from India which are equivalent to the existing measures as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009.\n(8) The sampling and the analysis of consignments should be performed in accordance with the relevant Union legislation. The maximum residue levels for pesticide residues are established by Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6). The provisions on sampling for the official control of pesticide residues are established by Commission Directive 2002/63/EC\u00a0(7).\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall apply to consignments of the following food falling within the CN codes and TARIC classifications set out in Annex I:\n(a) Okra (food, fresh and frozen) originating in or consigned from India;\n(b) Curry leaves (food, herbs) originating in or consigned from India.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall also apply to compound food, containing any of the food referred to in paragraph 1 in a quantity above 20 %.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall not apply to consignments of food referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 which are destined to a private person for personal consumption and use only.
