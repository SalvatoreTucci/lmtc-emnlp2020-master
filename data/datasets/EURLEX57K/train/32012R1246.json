It is therefore appropriate to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 616/2007\u00a0(3) to take into account the new quantities.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 616/2007 provides for a specific management method for the tariff quotas based on the origin of the products concerned. The new quotas should be managed in the same way.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 616/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The Agreements with Brazil and Thailand enter into force on 1 March 2013 while the quotas concerned are opened on an annual basis for the period from 1 July to 30 June. It is therefore appropriate to provide for derogations from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 616/2007 as to be amended by this Regulation. In particular, the annual quantity for the quota year 2012/2013 should be reduced on a pro rata basis. Furthermore, as it is not possible to lodge applications in advance for the new quotas to enter into force on 1 March 2013 a single quota period should apply from 1 March 2013 until 30 June 2013 and a derogation should be laid down to the normal application period provided in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 616/2007.
