Use of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater (FOM)' is authorized as a method for grading pig carcases.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe 6 millimetres in diameter, containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950/960 type, and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into terms of estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny 1= 62,567 - 0,6612x1 - 0,8287x2 + 0,0174x3 + 0,2130x4,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y 1  // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured 8 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,   // x2   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured between 6 and 8 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,  1.2.3.4.5.6 // x3   // = the coefficient   // [  // x1 + x2 2  // ]   // 2 ,  1.2 // x4   // = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilogram.", "1. Use of the apparatus termed Schlachtkoerperklassifizierungsgeraet (SKG II) is authorized as a method for grading pig carcases.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with electro-pneumatic calipers having a maximum pressure of 3 bars, an electro-mechanical angle-meter and a manually operated meter for measuring fat by means of a potentiometer. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny 1= 73,193 - 0,6683x1 + 0,29555x2 - 0,26037x3 - 18,02302x4 - 0,07303x5\nwhere:\n1.2 // y 1  // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of fat (including rind) in millimetres, covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius), measured at its thinnest point,   // x2   // = the width of the leg in millimetres, measured at its thickest point,   // x3   // = the width of the half-carcase at the flank in millimetres, measured at its narrowest point, 1.2.3.4 // x4   // = the coefficient   // x2 x3  // , 1.2 // x5   // = the angle of the leg in degrees, measured against the horizontal line.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilogram.", "1. Use of the method termed Zwei-Punkt-Messverfahren (ZP) is authorized as a method for grading pig carcases.\n2. The method shall provide for the measurement of visible fat and muscle on the midline of the split carcase by the following means:\nS = the minimum thickness of fat (including rind) in millimetres, covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius),\nF = the thickness of the lumbar muscle in millimetres, measured at the shortest connection between the front (cranial) end of the lumbar muscle and the upper (dorsal) edge of the vertebral canal.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase (y 1) shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny 1= 47,978 + 26,0429 S  F + 4,5154 ohm  F - 2,5018 log S - 8,4212 ohm  S.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilogram.", "Modifications of apparatus or of assessment methods shall not be authorized.", "The authorization of the three grading methods may be revoked.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 1986.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 133, 21. 5. 1986, p. 39.\n(3) OJ No L 301, 20. 11. 1984, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 326, 21. 11. 1986, p. 8.\n(5) OJ No L 285, 25. 10. 1985, p. 39."}
