In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 lays down general rules for granting export refunds and criteria for fixing the amount thereof.\n(3) On account of the market situation, the economic situation in the beef and veal sector and the scope for selling certain products of the sector, the conditions governing the payment of special export refunds on these products should be determined. In particular, conditions should be laid down for certain cuts of meat produced by boning quarters of male cattle.\n(4) In order to ensure that those objectives are complied with, a special supervisory procedure should be introduced. The origin of the product may be authenticated by the production of a certificate in accordance with the model set out in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 433/2007 of 20 April 2007 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds for beef and veal\u00a0(4).\n(5) With a view to ensuring compliance with the conditions laid down for the granting of refunds, it should be provided that the export formalities and, where appropriate, cutting and boning should only be carried out in the Member State in which the animals are slaughtered.\n(6) It should be specified that the grant of the special refund is to be conditional on all the cut meat produced by boning the quarters placed under supervision being exported. However, for hindquarters, with a view to obtaining better prices within the Community, certain exceptions to the general rule should be laid down without thereby jeopardising the goal of freeing the Community market. The circumstances in which the requirement to export all the meat obtained is not fully met without losing entitlement to the refund should be laid down. However, that possibility should be limited and made subject to restrictions to prevent misuse.\n(7) As far as time limits and proof of export are concerned, reference should be made to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(8) The application of the arrangements on victualling warehouses set out in Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 is incompatible with the purpose of this present Regulation. There is no need therefore to make any provision for applying the arrangements indicated in the Article 40 of that Regulation to the products in question.\n(9) In view of the special nature of this refund, no substitution should be permitted and means of identification of the products in question should be provided for.\n(10) The method by which the Member States notify the Commission of the quantities of products on which special export refunds have been granted should be laid down.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Individually packaged boneless cuts from fresh or chilled forequarters and hindquarters of adult male cattle with an average lean meat content of 55\u00a0% or more shall, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, qualify for special export refunds.", "For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018forequarters\u2019: unseparated or separated forequarters, as defined in Additional Notes 1.A (d) and (e) to Chapter 2 of the combined nomenclature, straight cut or \u2018Pistola\u2019;\n(b) \u2018hindquarters\u2019: unseparated or separated hindquarters, as defined in Additional Notes 1.A (f) and (g) to Chapter 2 of the combined nomenclature, with a maximum of eight ribs or eight pairs of ribs, straight cut or \u2018Pistola\u2019.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The operator shall submit to the competent authorities indicated by the Member States a declaration stating his intention to bone either forequarters or hindquarters as referred to in Article 1 under the terms of this Regulation and to export, subject to Article 7, the entire quantity of boned cuts obtained, each cut being individually packaged.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The declaration shall, in particular, describe and state the quantity of the products to be boned.\nIt shall be accompanied by a certificate, a model of which is set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 433/2007, issued in accordance with the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 2(2) of that Regulation.
