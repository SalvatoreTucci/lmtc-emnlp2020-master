A small number of outbreaks caused by the low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5 have been reported.\n(5) In its scientific opinions on the use of vaccination to control avian influenza issued by the European Food Safety Authority in 2005\u00a0(3) and 2007\u00a0(4) the Animal Health and Welfare Panel stated that emergency and preventive vaccination against avian influenza is a valuable tool to complement the control measures for that disease.\n(6) The outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza in Italy concern a densely populated poultry area and the epidemiogical situation is still evolving.\n(7) The Italian authorities have carried out a risk assessment and identified a particular risk for further spread of the virus in the areas concerned. Italy has, therefore, by letter dated 7 September 2007, submitted an emergency vaccination plan to the Commission for its approval.\n(8) The Commission has examined that plan together with Italy and is satisfied that it conforms with the relevant Community provisions. In the light of the development of the epidemiological situation in Italy, it is appropriate to approve the emergency vaccination plan submitted by Italy to supplement the control measures taken by that Member State and to introduce certain restrictions on movements of poultry, hatching eggs of poultry and day-old chicks and certain poultry products.\n(9) According to the vaccination plan, Italy intends to vaccinate certain poultry categories following the Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animal (DIVA) strategy using both monovalent vaccines directed against avian influenza virus of subtype H7 and bivalent vaccines against H7 and H5 subtypes.\n(10) Only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(5) or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency\u00a0(6) should be used.\n(11) In addition, surveillance and monitoring of vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks as set out in the emergency vaccination plan should be carried out.\n(12) The measures provided for in Decision 2005/926/EC are no longer appropriate and that Decision should therefore be repealed.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter, scope and definitions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision lays down certain measures to be applied in Italy where emergency vaccination is carried out in certain poultry holdings at particular risk for introduction of avian influenza, including certain restrictions on movements and dispatch of poultry, hatching eggs of poultry and day-old chicks and certain products derived thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision shall apply without prejudice to the measures taken by Italy in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC to control outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza.", "The emergency vaccination plan\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plan for emergency vaccination against low pathogenic avian influenza in Italy, as submitted by Italy to the Commission on 7 September 2007 (\u2018the emergency vaccination plan\u2019) is approved.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Italy shall carry out the emergency vaccination plan in the areas listed in Annex I (\u2018the emergency vaccination area\u2019).\nIt shall ensure that the emergency vaccination plan is implemented effectively.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall publish the emergency vaccination plan on its website.", "Vaccines to be used\nItaly shall ensure that poultry is vaccinated in accordance with the emergency vaccination plan with one of the following types of vaccine authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004:\n(a) an inactivated heterologous vaccine of avian influenza subtype H7;
