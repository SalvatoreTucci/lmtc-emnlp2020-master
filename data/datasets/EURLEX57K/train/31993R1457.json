whereas experience gained in recent years has shown that live pure-bred breeding animals weighing at least 250 kilograms  in the case of females and 300 kilograms in that of males should be treated in the same way as other bovine animals, subject to certain special administrative formalities;\nWhereas export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some fresh or chilled meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0201, on some frozen meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0202, on some meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code  0206 and on some other prepared or preserved meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 1602 50 10;\nWhereas, in view of the wide differences in products covered by CN codes 0201 20 90 700 and 0202 20 90 100 used for refund purposes, refunds should only be granted on cuts in which the weight of bone does not exceed one third;\nWhereas, in the case of meat of bovine animals, boned or boneless, salted and dried, there are traditional trade flows to Switzerland; whereas, to allow this trade to continue, the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss  market and export prices in the Member States; whereas there are possibilities for exporting such meat and also salted, smoked and dried meat to certain African, Near and Middle Eastern countries; whereas a refund should accordingly be set;\nWhereas, in the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80, the Community share of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present  available;\nWhereas, in the case of other beef and veal products, a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant;\nWhereas the representative market rates defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (10) are used to convert amounts expressed in third country currencies and are used as the basis for determining the agricultural conversion rates of the  Member States' currencies; whereas detailed rules on the application and determination of these conversions were set by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3819/92 (11);\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (12), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 425/93 (13), establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds;\nWhereas, in order to simplify customs export formalities for operators, the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals;\nWhereas experience has shown that in certain cases it is often difficult to determine the relevant quantities of beef, veal and other meat contained in prepared or preserved meat covered by CN code 1602 50; whereas exclusively beef and veal products  should accordingly be set apart and a new heading should be created for mixtures of meats or offals; whereas checks on products other than mixtures of meat or offal should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on  manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (14), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83 (15);\nWhereas refunds on female animals should vary depending on their age in order to prevent abuses in the export of certain pure-bred breeding animals;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1432/92 (16), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3534/92 (17), prohibits trade between the Community and the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro; whereas that prohibition does not apply to certain cases given in  the limitative enumeration in Articles 2 and 3 of that Regulation; whereas account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed;\nWhereas, notwithstanding the subdivision of the combined nomenclature for prepared and preserved meat, other than uncooked, falling within CN code 1602 50, experience has shown that it is possible to delete from the refund nomenclature several products  falling within CN code 1602 50 31 and to amend the list of products falling within CN code 1602 50 80;\nWhereas the Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["1.
