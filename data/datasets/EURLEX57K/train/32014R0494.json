However, some Member States have outlined concerns in relation to the changed animal health situation in Belarus, referring to outbreaks of African swine fever. They fear that the export of unprocessed hay and straw from that third country may pose a high animal health risk to the Union. It has thus been requested to adopt precautionary measures through the adoption of more restrictive import conditions for hay and straw from Belarus.\n(6) Analysis shows that the animal health situation in Belarus and Ukraine does not present a risk of spreading infectious or contagious animal diseases into the Union, if only pelleted straw intended for combustion is allowed for import, provided it is directly delivered from the approved border inspection post (BIP) of entry into the Union to the destination plant where it is going to be burned. To ensure that such consignments do not present a risk to animal health being deviated from their intended destination, they need to be moved under customs transit procedure, as provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92\u00a0(3), and be monitored in the integrated computerised veterinary system (TRACES) accordingly from the BIP of entry to the destination plant.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down procedures for veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries (OJ L\u00a021, 28.1.2004, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ L\u00a0302, 19.10.1992, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX V\nTHE LIST OF COUNTRIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 9\nISO Code Country\nAU Australia\nBY Belarus\u00a0(1)\nCA Canada\nCH Switzerland\nCL Chile\nGL Greenland\nIS Iceland\nNZ New Zealand\nRS Serbia\u00a0(2)\nUA Ukraine\u00a0(1)\nUS United States of America\nZA South Africa (excluding that part of the foot\u2013and\u2013mouth disease control area situated in the veterinary region Northern and Eastern Transvaal, in the district of Ingwavuma of the veterinary region of Natal and in the border area with Botswana east of longitude 28\u00b0)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Only pelleted straw intended for combustion, which is directly delivered under customs transit procedure as provided for in Article\u00a04(16)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (OJ L\u00a0302, 19.10.1992, p.\u00a01) and through monitoring in TRACES from the approved border inspection post (BIP) of entry into the Union to the destination plant in the Union, where it is going to be burnt.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0As referred to in Article 135 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part (OJ L\u00a0278, 18.10.2013, p.\u00a016).\u2019"}
