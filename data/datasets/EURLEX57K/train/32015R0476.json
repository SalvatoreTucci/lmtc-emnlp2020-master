In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n(2) By Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009\u00a0(5), common rules were laid down for protection against dumped imports from countries which are not members of the European Union.\n(3) By Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009\u00a0(6), common rules were laid down for protection against subsidised imports from countries which are not members of the European Union.\n(4) Under the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (\u2018WTO\u2019), an Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (\u2018DSU\u2019) was reached. Pursuant to the DSU, the Dispute Settlement Body (\u2018DSB\u2019) was established.\n(5) With a view to permitting the Union, where it considers this appropriate, to bring a measure taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in a report adopted by the DSB, specific provisions should be laid down.\n(6) The Commission may consider it appropriate to repeal, amend or adopt any other special measures with respect to measures taken under Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 or Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, including measures which have not been the subject of dispute settlement under the DSU, in order to take account of the legal interpretations made in a report adopted by the DSB. In addition, the Commission should be able, where appropriate, to suspend or review such measures.\n(7) Recourse to the DSU is not subject to time limits. The recommendations in reports adopted by the DSB only have prospective effect. Consequently, it is appropriate to specify that any measures taken under this Regulation will take effect from the date of their entry into force, unless otherwise specified, and, therefore, do not provide any basis for the reimbursement of the duties collected prior to that date.\n(8) The implementation of this Regulation requires uniform conditions for adopting measures following a report adopted by the DSB concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7).\n(9) The advisory procedure should be used for the suspension of measures for a limited period of time given the effects of such measures,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whenever the DSB adopts a report concerning a Union measure taken pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, to Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 or to this Regulation (\u2018disputed measure\u2019), the Commission may take one or more of the following measures, whichever it considers appropriate, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 4(3):\n(a) repeal or amend the disputed measure; or\n(b) adopt any other special implementing measure deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances in order to bring the Union into conformity with the recommendations and rulings contained in the report.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of taking a measure under paragraph 1, the Commission may request interested parties to provide all necessary information in order to complete the information obtained during the investigation that resulted in the adoption of the disputed measure.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as it is appropriate to conduct a review before or at the same time as taking any measure under paragraph\u00a01, that review shall be initiated by the Commission.
