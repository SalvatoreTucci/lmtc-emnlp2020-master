According to Article 2(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 917/2004, the apiculture programme measures laid down for every year of the three-year period shall be implemented by 31 August of the year to which they relate and payments shall be carried out during the annual exercise established from 16 October of the same year to 15 October of the following year. As a result, Member States cannot implement apiculture measures between 1 September of the year of the apiculture programme and 15 October of the same year.\n(2) In order to avoid the gap between the implementation and the funding of apiculture measures, the relevant dates need to be changed so that measures can be implemented all year round.\n(3) The Union financial contribution to national apiculture programmes is based on the bee census/number of hives in each Member State as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 917/2004.\n(4) In accordance with Article 109 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, Member States submitted their national apiculture programmes and updated the numbers of hives as provided for in Article 1(a) of Regulation (EC) No 917/2004. The updated numbers of hives should be reflected in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 917/2004.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 917/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The amendments provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation for Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 917/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n(2) Annex I is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply as from the 2014 apiculture year starting on 1 September 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 163, 30.4.2004, p. 83.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nMember State Bee census\nBE 107\u00a0800\nBG 526\u00a0014\nCZ 540\u00a0705\nDK 150\u00a0000\nDE 711\u00a0299\nEE 41\u00a0400\nIE 15\u00a0710\nEL 1\u00a0584\u00a0206\nES 2\u00a0459\u00a0292\nFR 1\u00a0636\u00a0000\nHR 491\u00a0481\nIT 1\u00a0316\u00a0774\nCY 44\u00a0953\nLV 83\u00a0801\nLT 144\u00a0969\nLU 7\u00a0804\nHU 1\u00a0088\u00a0590\nMT 3\u00a0142\nNL 80\u00a0000\nAT 376\u00a0485\nPL 1\u00a0280\u00a0693\nPT 566\u00a0793\nRO 1\u00a0550\u00a0000\nSI 167\u00a0000\nSK 254\u00a0859\nFI 50\u00a0000\nSE 150\u00a0000\nUK 274\u00a0000\nEU 28 15\u00a0704\u00a0270\u2019"}
