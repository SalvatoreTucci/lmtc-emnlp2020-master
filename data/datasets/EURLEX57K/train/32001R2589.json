That list was drawn up in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.\n(2) The Czech Republic submitted to the Commission a request to extend the product categories, included in the list provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, in order to include livestock and livestock products. It submitted the information required pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 94/92.\n(3) The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the authorities of the Czech Republic has led to the conclusion that in this country the rules governing production and inspection of livestock and livestock products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.\n(4) However, the result of the examination revealed also that the Czech rules relating to products bearing or intended to bear indications referring to conversion are not equivalent to those in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, as regards products containing more than one ingredient of agricultural origin.
