FIELD OF APPLICATION\nThis method is applicable, after removal of non-fibrous matter, to binary mixtures of:\n1. certain protein fibres, namely: wool (1), animal hair (2 and 3), silk (4), protein (21)\nwith\n2. cotton (5), cupro (19), modal (20), viscose (23), acrylic (24), chlorofibres (25), polyamide or nylon (28), polyester (29), polypropylene (31), elastane (37) and glass fibre (38).\nIf different protein fibres are present, the method gives the total of their amounts but not their individual quantities.\n2. PRINCIPLE\nThe protein fibre is diseolved out from a know dry mass of the mixture, with a hypochlorite solution. The residue is collected, washed, dried and weighed; its mass, corrected if necessary, is expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the mixture. The percentage of dry protein fibre is found by difference.\nEither lithium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite can be used for the preparation of the hypochlorite solution.\nLithium hypochlorite is recommended in cases involving a small number of analyses or for analyses conducted at fairly lengthy intervals. This is because the percentage of hypochlorite in solid lithium hypochlorite - unlike that in sodium hypochlorite - is virtually constant. If the percentage of hypochlorite is known, hypochlorite content need not be checked iodometrically for each analysis, since a constant weighed portion of lithium hypochlorite can be employed.\n3. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS (other than those specified in the general instructions)\n3.1. Apparatus\n(i) Erlenmeyer flask with ground-glass stopper, 250 ml;\n(ii) Thermostat, adjustable to 20 (\u00b1 2) \u00b0C.\n3.2. Reagents\n(i) Hypochlorite reagent\n(a) Lithium hypochlorite solution\nThis consists of a freshly prepared solution containing 35 (\u00b1 2) g/l of active chlorine (approximately 1 M), to which 5 (\u00b1 0,5) g/l of previously dissolved sodium hydroxide is added. To prepare, dissolve 100 grams of lithium hypochlorite containing 35 % active chlorine (or 115 grams containing 30 % active chlorine) in approximately 700 ml of distilled water, add 5 grams of sodium hydroxide dissolved in approximately 200 ml of distilled water and make up to 1 litre with distilled water. The solution which has been freshly prepared needs not be checked iodometrically;\n(b) Sodium hypochlorite solution\nThis consists of a freshly prepared solution containing 35 (\u00b1 2) g/l of active chlorine (approximately 1 M) to which 5 (\u00b1 0,5) g/l of previously dissolved sodium hydroxide is added.\nCheck the active chlorine content of the solution iodometrically before each analysis;\n(ii) Acetic acid, dilute solution\nDilute 5 ml of glacial acetic acid to 1 litre with water.\n4. TEST PROCEDURE\nFollow the procedure described in the general instructions and proceed as follows: mix approximately 1 gram of the sample with approximately 100 ml of the hypochlorite solution (lithium or sodium hypochlorite) in the 250 ml flask and agitate thoroughly in order to wet out the sample. Then heat the flask for 40 minutes in a thermostat at 20 \u00b0C and agitate continuously, or at least at regular intervals. Since the dissolution of the wool proceeds exothermically, the reaction heat of this method must be distributed and removed. Otherwise, considerable errors may be caused by the incipient dissolution of the non-soluble fibres.\nAfter 40 minutes, filter the flask contents through a weighed glass-filter crucible and transfer any residual fibres into the filter crucible by rinsing the flask with a little hypochlorite reagent. Drain the crucible with suction and wash the residue successively with water, dilute acetic acid, and finally water, draining the crucible with suction after each addition. Do not apply suction until each washing liquor has drained under gravity.\nFinally, drain the crucible with suction, dry the crucible with the residue, and cool and weigh them.\n5. CALCULATION AND EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nCalculate the results as described in the general instructions. The value of d is 1,00, except for cotton, viscose and modal, for which d = 1,01, and unbleached cotton, for which d = 1,03.\n6. PRECISION\nOn homogenous mixtures of textile materials, the confidence limits for results obtained by this method are not greater than \u00b1 1 for a confidence level of 95 %.'\nMethod No 8\nThe text is hereby amended as follows:\nIn item 4 ('Test procedure'), the 5th, 6th and 7th paragraphs read as follows:\n'Transfer any residual fibre to the crucible by washing out the beaker with dimethylformamide. Drain the crucible with suction. Wash the residue with about 1 litre of hot water at 70 - 80 \u00b0C, filling the crucible each time. After each addition of water, apply suction briefly but not until the water has drained under gravity. If the washing liquor drains through the crucible too slowly, slight suction may be applied.\nFinally dry the crucible with the residue, cool and weigh them.'\nItem 5 ('Calculation and expression of results') reads as follows:\n'Calculate the results as described in the general instructions. The value of \"d\" is 1,00 except in the following cases:\nwool 1,01\ncotton 1,01\ncupro 1,01\nmodal 1,01\npolyester 1,01.'\nMethod No 12\nThis method is deleted.\nANNEX II\nMETHOD No 16\nCHLOROFIBRES, CERTAIN MODACRYLICS, CERTAIN ELASTANES, ACETATES, TRIACETATES AND CERTAIN OTHER FIBRES\n(Method using cyclohexanone)\n1. FIELD OF APPLICATION\nThis method is applicable, after removal of non-fibrous matter, to binary mixtures of\n1. acetate (17), triacetate (22), chlorofibre (25), certain modacrylics (27), certain elastanes (37)\nwith\n2. wool (1), animal hair (2 and 3), silk (4), cotton (5), cupro (19), modal (20), viscose (23), polyamide or nylon (28), acrylic (24) and glass fibre (38).\nWhere modacrylics or elastanes are present a preliminary test must first be carried out to determine whether the fibre is completely soluble in the reagent.\nIt is also possible to analyze mixtures containing chlorofibres by using method No 9 or 15.\n2. PRINCIPLE\nThe acetate and triacetate fibres, chlorofibres, certain modacrylics, and certain elastanes are dissolved out from a known dry mass with cyclohexanone at a temperature close to boiling point. The residue is collected, washed, dreid and weighed; its mass, corrected if necessary, is expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the mixture. The percentage of chlorofibre, modacrylic, elastane, acetate and triacetate is found by difference.\n3. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS (other than those described in the general instructions)\n3.1. Apparatus\n(i) Hot extraction apparatus suitable for use in the test procedure in section 4. (See figure: this is a variant of the apparatus described in Melliand Textilberichte 56 (1975) 643-645);\n(ii) Filter crucible to contain the specimen;\n(iii) Porous baffle (porosity grade 1);\n(iv) Reflux condenser that can be adapted to the distillation flask;\n(v) Heating device.\n3.2. Reagents\n(i) Cyclohexanone, boiling point 156 \u00b0C;\n(ii) Ethyl alcohol, 50 % by volume.\nNB: Cyclohexanone is flammable and toxic. Suitable precautions must be taken in its use.\n4. TEST PROCEDURE\nFollow the procedure described in the general instructions and then proceed as follows:\nPour into the distillation flask 100 ml of cyclohexanone per gram of material, insert the extraction container in which the filter crucible, containing the specimen and the porous baffle, slightly inclined, have previously been placed. Insert the reflux condenser. Bring to the boil and continue extraction for 60 minutes at a minimum rate of 12 cycles per hour. After extraction and cooling remove the extraction container, take out the filter crucible and remove the porous baffle. Wash the contents of the filter crucible three or four times with 50 % ethyl alcohol heated to about 60 \u00b0C and subsequently with 1 litre of water at 60 \u00b0C. Do not apply suction during or between the washing operations. Allow the liquid to drain under gravity and then apply suction.\nFinally dry the crucible with the residue, cool and weigh them.\n5. CALCULATION AND EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nCalculate the results as described in the general instructions. The value of 'd' is 1,00 with the following exceptions:\nsilk 1,01\nacrylic 0,98.\n6. PRECISION\nOn homogeneous mixtures of textile fibres, the confidence limits of results obtained by this method are not greater than \u00b1 1 for a confidence level of 95 %."}
