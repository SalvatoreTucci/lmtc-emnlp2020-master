whereas under this agreement, Czechoslovakia undertook to take all the necessary steps to keep its exports of the products in question within certain limits;\nWhereas, in order to implement this agreement and take account of its particular provisions, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3762/83 (5), introduced specific common rules for imports of certain textile products;\nWhereas, because of the disparities in market conditions within the Community and the particular sensitivity of this sector of Community industry, the Community ceiling was divided among the Member States so as to take account of these factors; whereas the quota allocated to the United Kingdom was 62 tonnes for 1984;\nWhereas disparities exist in the conditions governing imports of such textile products into the different Member States; whereas such disparities may give rise to deflection of trade;\nWhereas, in order to deflect rapidly deflections of trade which could aggravate or give rise to economic difficulties in the sector concerned, the Government of the United Kingdom requested the Commission, under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC, for authorization to apply prior intra-Community surveillance to imports of textile products falling within categories 2, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20, 32 and 83, originating in Turkey, and textile products falling within category 90, originating in Czechoslovakia, and put into free circulation in the other Member States;\nWhereas the Commission has examined whether the imports concerned could be made subject to intra-Community surveillance measures under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC;\nWhereas this examination has shown that there is a risk of deflections of trade occurring via the other Member States in the case of textile products falling within categories 2, 4, 6, 9, 32, 83 and 90, thus jeopardizing the objectives aimed at by the safeguard measures indicated above and aggravating or prolonging the economic difficulties of the industry concerned;\nWhereas, on these circumstances, there is reason to authorize the United Kingdom, for a given period, to apply intra-Community surveillance to imports of the textile products in question originating in Turkey and Czechoslovakia and put into free circulation in the other Member States,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is authorized to introduce, in accordance with Decision 80/47/EEC, intra-Community surveillance of imports of the textile products in the categories indicated in the annex hereto, originating in Turkey and Czechoslovakia and put into free circulation in the other Member States.
