This temperature must remain constant throughout the test.\nFor a given pressure, the value measured for increasing pressure must not exceed the value measured for decreasing pressures.\n2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Return of the instrument's index to a predetermined mark\nAt atmospheric pressure, the pressure gauge index must stop opposite the zero mark or opposite a predetermined mark clearly differentiated from the scale intervals, within the limits of the maximum permissible error. A pressure gauge may possess a stop at a distance corresponding to at least twice the value of the maximum permissible error below zero or below the predetermined mark.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Technical requirements\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Construction\nPressure gauges must be robustly and carefully constructed to ensure that they retain their metrological characteristics.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indicating device\n3.2.1. Indicating devices are graduated in bar, the value of the scale intervals being fixed at 0,1 bar.\n3.2.2. In the measurement range, the indicating device must make it possible to read off, directly and accurately, the value of the pressure measured. To this end, the thickness of the part of the index which covers the scale marks must not be greater than the thickness of the scale marks themselves. The index must be capable of covering approximately half the length of the shortest scale marks. The maximum distance between the index and the plane of the scale marks must not be greater than the length of the scale division and must in no case exceed 2 mm or 0,02 L + 1 mm in the case of circular-dial indicating devices (L being the distance between the axis of rotation of the pointer and its extremity).\n3.2.3. The scale intervals must be equal over the entire scale. The scale spacings, which must not be less than 1,25 mm, must be either virtually equal or show only slight variations. Variation of scale spacing is permitted if the difference between two consecutive scale spacings does not exceed 20 % of the largest value and if the difference between the smallest and largest scale spacings does not exceed 50 % of the largest value.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inscriptions and marks\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inscriptions\n4.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compulsory inscriptions\nPressure gauges must bear the following inscriptions:\n(a) on the dial:\n\u2014 the symbol for the quantity measured, Pe,\n\u2014 the symbol for the unit of measurement, bar,\n\u2014 where necessary, a sign indicating the working position of the instrument;\n(b) on the dial, data plate or on the instrument itself:\n\u2014 manufacturer's identification particulars,\n\u2014 identification particulars of the instrument,\n\u2014 the EEC pattern approval mark.\n4.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Optional inscriptions\nPressure gauges may also carry additional inscriptions authorized by the competent national authority, provided that they do not impede reading of the instrument indication.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification and sealing marks\nA suitable place must be provided for affixing the EEC initial verification marks.\nThe pressure gauges must be capable of being sealed in such a way as to render it impossible to alter the characteristics of the instrument.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EEC pattern approval\nEEC pattern approval of pressure gauges must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Directive 71/361/EEC.\nAt least two pressure gauges must be submitted for examination when application is made for pattern approval.
