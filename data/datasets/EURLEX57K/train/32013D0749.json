Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Portugal\u2019s total VAT own resources base. Portugal is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions. Portugal should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resources base using approximate estimates in accordance with the second indent of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89.\n(3) For reasons of transparency and legal certainty it is appropriate to limit the applicability of the authorisation in time.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Own Resources,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base from 1 January 2013, Portugal is authorised to use approximate estimates in respect of the following categories of transactions referred to in Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC:\nTransport of passengers (point (10)).", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nJanusz LEWANDOWSKI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 7.6.1989, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1."}
