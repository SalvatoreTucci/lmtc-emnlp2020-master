ANNEX   NON-EXHAUSTIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DEFINITION, SELECTION, PRESENTATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PILOT PROJECTS AND INNOVATORY MEASURES  III. DEFINITION\ni(i) Pilot projects\n1. A pilot project must constitute a coherent programme of assistance for the economically and socially less privileged and not simply be a collection of unconnected, heterogeneous projects.\n2. Pilot projects must be implemented in locations defined in terms of their characteristics and size (district, town, region).\nThe location selected must lend itself to action in depth, and in particular must enable all interested parties to work together.\n3. Pilot projects must relate to several aspects of the situation of the economically and socially less privileged, e.g. income, housing, health, education, social protection, employment, training, culture.\nThe choice of aspects must be such as to ensure that the pilot project forms a consistent whole.\n4. Pilot projects must involve the population of the selected area in a spirit of participation.\nPilot projects must have the support of private participants (e.g. employers) or associations (e.g. trade unions, local groups, local development associations) and of the public authorities (local, regional and/or national, as appropriate).\n5. Pilot projects must be sufficiently representative to provide information of general interest regarding the economically and socially less privileged and to allow of subsequent transfer to other entities or expansion.\n6. Pilot project must be aimed primarily at those who are economically and socially most disadvantaged.\n(ii) Innovatory measures\n1. Innovatory measures must demonstrate cases in which specific action is required to assist the most disadvantaged.\n2. Innovatory measures may take the form of new responses to certain specific situations.\n3. Whether a measure is in fact innovatory must be determined by reference to what is being done in the Community as a whole.\nIII. SELECTION\nWhen pilot projects and innovatory measures are selected, account will be taken of the extent to which pilot projects or innovatory measures:\n1. are carried out by participants with particular qualifications and/or experience;\n2. effectively assist the group of people they cover;\n3. encourage the independence and self-confidence of the persons concerned, including measures to promote self-sufficiency;\n4. help the employment situation (e.g. promotion of self-employment, improvement of vocational skills);\n5. channel aid to the most disadvantaged;\n6. concentrate on socially and economically disadvantaged areas.\nIII. PRESENTATION\nApplications for Community aid must:\n1. state precisely\n- the aim of the pilot project or innovatory measure,\n- the group of people covered,\n- the location chosen and type of area,\n- the number and type of participants and authorities involved;\n2. describe what the pilot project or innovatory measure is expected to achieve and estimate the probable cost;\n3. be designed in such a way that the results to be achieved may be compared.\nIV. ASSESSMENT\nEach pilot project and innovatory measure should be assessed continuously and at the end of the programme."}
