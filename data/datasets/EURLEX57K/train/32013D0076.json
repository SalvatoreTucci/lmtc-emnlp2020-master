Should no healthy slaughtered animals have been tested in 2011, the surveillance system would still have ensured a design prevalence of one case per 5\u00a0355\u00a0627 in the adult population of the EU-25 at a confidence level of 95\u00a0%.\n(6) Considering the decreasing trend of BSE in the European Union, EFSA\u2019s estimate that in the EU-25 the surveillance system based on the testing of at risk sub-populations only would easily meet the international standard regarding the performance of BSE surveillance systems, and the fact that no testing of healthy slaughtered animals is required to meet the international standard established by the OIE for the monitoring of BSE provided that animals from the three at risk sub-populations are tested, the testing of healthy slaughtered cattle could be stopped in the EU-25. The provisions for the surveillance system of healthy slaughtered cattle in the EU-25 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Paragraph 3 of Article 2 of Decision 2009/719/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, from 1 January 2013 Member States listed in the Annex may decide not to test animals in the subpopulation referred to in that point.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 29.9.2009, p. 35.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 161, 21.6.2011, p. 29.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(10):2913."}
