The amounts allocated for the period 2011 to 2013 to the Czech Republic and Slovakia should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\n(3) In accordance with points 16 and 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management\u00a0(3) on 16 April 2010 the Commission adopted the Communication on the technical adjustment of the financial framework for 2011 in line with movements in GNI, including the adjustment of amounts allocated from funds supporting cohesion to the Member States concerned by divergence between estimated and actual GDP for the period 2007-2009\u00a0(4), by which it informed that a positive adjustment is necessary for the Czech Republic of EUR\u00a0237\u00a0045\u00a0801 and for Slovakia of EUR\u00a0137\u00a0711\u00a0534, to be shared in equal amounts in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\n(4) In order to establish the amounts allocated to the Member States concerned, it is necessary to take into account the pro-rata allocation between the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in the current programming period 2007-2013 for each of the Member States concerned and the need to make the most efficient use of the allocation of the funds to projects currently being implemented. Therefore, this Decision should allocate only the part of the overall positive adjustments concerning the Regional competitiveness and employment objective.\n(5) Decision 2006/593/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2006/593/EC is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."],
