whereas by Regulation (EEC) No 1516/91 (1)  these quotas shall be open until 30 June 1992;\nWhereas these duties are reduced to 12,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1992 and to 0 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1993; whereas, in consequence, the volume of the abovementioned quotas should be reduced, pro rata temporis, to cover only the  period from 1 July to 31 December 1992, taking into account the average percentage represented by the quantities actually imported during the three previous quota periods for which statistics are available, namely the second halves of 1989, 1990 and  1991; whereas, by way of derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Regulation (EEC) No 4161/87 (2) lays down consequent on the entry into force of the combined nomenclature, the basic duties to be adopted within the Community as constituted on  31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the imports of these wines Community tariff quotas should be  opened for the abovementioned period for the abovementioned wines at duties as shown in the list in Article 1;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade in agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (3) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question  coming from Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quotas are only applicable in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2573/90 of 5 September 1990 totally suspending certain customs duties applicable by the Community of Ten to imports from Spain and Portugal (4), the said duties are, as concerns the products referred  to in Annex II to the Treaty, totally suspended once they reach a level of 2 % or less; whereas it is therefore necessary to apply a duty equal to zero where the value of the specific customs duties does not exceed 2 % ad valorem;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are  exhausted; whereas they should not be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to a procedure laid down in Article 3; whereas this  method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the contingents may be  carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["From 1 July to 31 December 1992 the customs duties applicable on the following quality wines produced in the specified regions shall, in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985, be partially suspended at the levels and within the  limits of the Community tariff quotas indicated for each of them:\nOrder No  CN codes (1)  Description  Rate (ECU/hl)\nfrom 1 July to 31 December 1992 (2)  Quota volume (hectolitres)             09.0317  ex 2204 21 41\nex 2204 21 51\nex 2204 29 41\nex 2204 29 51  Sherry  0,8\n0,8\n0,8\n0,9  455 694        09.0310  ex 2204 21 49\nex 2204 21 59  Wine from M\u00e1laga  1,2\n1,4  5 713        09.0312  ex 2204 21 21\nex 2204 21 23\nex 2204 21 31\nex 2204 21 33\nex 2204 21 49  Wine from Jumilla, Priorato, Rioja, Valdepe\u00f1as  1,2\n1,4\n1,8  11 393\n(1) See Taric codes in Annex.\n(2) These specific customs duties are collected only when their value is greater than 2 % ad valorem.", "The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission, which may take all appropriate administrative measures in order to ensure effective administration thereof.", "If an importer presents in a Member State a declaration of entry into free circulation, including a request for preferential benefit for a product covered by this Regulation and if this declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the  Member States concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to its requirements from the corresponding amount.\nThe drawing requests, with indication of the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be transmitted to the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings are granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the declarations of entry into free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member States concerned to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the corresponding quota amount.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota amount, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests.
