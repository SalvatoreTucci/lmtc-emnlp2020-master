Furthermore, an increase in production planned for the first quarter of 2002, resulting in postponement of slaughter of animals currently held on farms, could also lead to a further fall in prices for certain categories of bovine animals. The derogations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 should therefore be extended to the first quarter of 2002 and, at the same time, certain adjustments should be made.\n(3) The special premium referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 will increase for steers from EUR 136 to EUR 150 for 2002. As a result, that figure should also be reflected in the price reduction (per half carcase) for store cattle (weanlings).\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 should consequently be amended.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following: \"3. Notwithstanding Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000, the maximum weight of the carcases referred to therein shall be:\n- 380 kg for the first three tendering procedures in the first quarter of 2002, and\n- 370 kg for the last two tendering procedures in the first quarter of 2002.\nHowever, carcases of a greater weight may be bought in. In that case, the buying-in price paid shall not be more than the price for that maximum weight or, in the case of forequarters, the buying-in price paid shall not be more than 40 % of the price for the maximum weight authorised.\"\n(b) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following: \"4. Notwithstanding Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2000:\n- the delivery period for the second and fifth tendering procedures in the first quarter of 2002 shall be 24 calendar days.\"\n(c) the figure \"68\" in the second sentence of the third indent of paragraph 7 is replaced by \"75\".\n2.
