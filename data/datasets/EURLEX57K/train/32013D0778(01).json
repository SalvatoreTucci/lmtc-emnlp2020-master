Separating the policymaking tasks of the Commission from programme implementation tasks in the Agency has enabled both parties to perform better on their core duties. The external evaluation of the Agency carried out in accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that it has been efficient and effective in managing the SME-related actions under the Capacities Specific Programme, the Marie Curie Actions under the People Specific Programme, the Space and Security research actions under the Cooperation Specific Programme and in providing administrative and logistical support services to all programme areas of the People, Capacities and Cooperation Specific Programmes. Savings resulting from the delegation of tasks to the Agency have been estimated at some EUR 106 million over the period 2009-2013.\n(6) In its Communication of 29 June 2011\u2018A budget for Europe 2020\u2019\u00a0(7), the Commission proposed to use the option of more extensive recourse to existing executive agencies for the implementation of Union programmes in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework (hereinafter referred to as the MFF).\n(7) The cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that the efficiency of the Agency\u2019s operations is higher in comparison with the Commission\u2019s. The new delegated programmes are thematically in line with the current mandate and mission of the Agency and represent the continuation of the Agency\u2019s existing activities. The Agency has already built-up competence, skills and capacities, which are directly relevant for these programmes. The Agency is well placed to continue managing research programmes under the 2014-2020 MFF. Delegation of programme management to the Agency would ensure the business continuity for the programmes\u2019 beneficiaries, given that the Agency has built up relevant competence and capacity focussing on the research community. Delegation of programme management to the Agency is estimated to deliver efficiency gains of EUR 158 million over the period 2014-2024 when compared to the management by the Commission services.\n(8) In order to give executive agencies a coherent identity, the Commission has, as far as possible, grouped work by thematic policy area in establishing their new mandates.\n(9) The Agency should be entrusted with the management of the following parts of the Specific Programme Implementing Horizon 2020 \u2014 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)\u00a0(8):\n\u2014 Part I \u2018Excellent science\u2019 succeeding similar activities which under the 2007-2013 MFF are managed by the Commission and which are characterised by projects that generate a large number of homogenous and standardised operations,\n\u2014 Part II \u2018Industrial leadership\u2019 succeeding similar activities which under the 2007-2013 MFF are already partly managed by the Agency and which involve implementation of technical projects that do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 Part III \u2018Societal challenges\u2019 succeeding similar activities which under the 2007-2013 MFF are managed by the Commission and which involve implementation of technical projects that do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 Part IIIa \u2018Spreading excellence and widening participation\u2019 succeeding similar activities which under the 2007-2013 MFF are managed by the Commission and which involve implementation of technical projects that do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle,\n\u2014 Part IIIb \u2018Science with and for society\u2019 succeeding similar activities which under the 2007-2013 MFF are managed by the Commission and which involve implementation of technical projects that do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of technical and financial expertise throughout the project cycle.\n(10) The Agency should continue with the implementation of the parts of the Seventh Framework Programme already delegated to it under the 2007-2013 MFF.\n(11) The Agency should be responsible for the provision of administrative and logistical support services in particular where centralisation of those support services would result in additional cost-efficiency gains and economies of scale.\n(12) In order to ensure a consistent implementation in time of this Decision and of the programmes concerned, it is necessary to ensure that the Agency shall exercise its tasks linked to the implementation of those programmes subject to and from the date on which those programmes enter into force.\n(13) The Research Executive Agency should be established. It should replace and succeed the executive agency established by Decision 2008/46/EC. It should operate in accordance with the general statute laid down by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.\n(14) Decision 2008/46/EC should therefore be repealed and transitional provisions should be set out.\n(15) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Establishment\nThe Research Executive Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) is hereby established and shall replace and succeed the executive agency set up by Decision 2008/46/EC from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2024, its statute being governed by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Brussels.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency is hereby entrusted, within the framework of the Specific Programme Implementing Horizon 2020 \u2014 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) with the implementation of parts of:\n(a) Part I \u2018Excellent science\u2019;\n(b) Part II \u2018Industrial leadership\u2019;\n(c) Part III \u2018Societal challenges\u2019;\n(d) Part IIIa \u2018Spreading excellence and widening participation\u2019;\n(e) Part IIIb \u2018Science with and for society\u2019.\nThis paragraph shall apply subject to and as from the date of the entry into force of the Specific Programme Implementing Horizon 2020 \u2014 The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency is hereby entrusted, within the framework of the Seventh Framework Programme, with the implementation of the legacy of parts of the following programmes:\n(a) the activities \u2018Research for SMEs\u2019 and \u2018Research for SME associations\u2019 of the Capacities Specific Programme;\n(b) the \u2018Space\u2019 and \u2018Security\u2019 themes of the Cooperation Specific Programme;\n(c) the People Specific Programme.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be responsible for the following tasks related to the implementation of the parts of the Union programmes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:\n(a) managing some stages of programme implementation and some phases in the lifetime of specific projects on the basis of the relevant work programmes adopted by the Commission, where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation;\n(b) adopting the instruments of budget execution for revenue and expenditure and carrying out all the operations necessary for the management of the programme, where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation;\n(c) providing support in programme implementation where the Commission has empowered it to do so in the instrument of delegation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be responsible for the provision of administrative and logistical support services as defined in the instrument of delegation.
