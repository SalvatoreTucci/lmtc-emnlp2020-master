As a consequence, the marketing of piglets and their transport to fattening units are temporarily prohibited in those zones.\n(2) The restrictions on the free movement of goods resulting from the application of these veterinary measures are likely to cause serious disturbance of the pigmeat market in Germany. As a consequence, exceptional market support measures applying solely to piglets from the zones directly affected should be adopted for the time strictly necessary.\n(3) With a view to preventing the disease from spreading any further, piglets reared in the zones concerned should be excluded from normal trade and processed into products intended for uses other than human consumption in accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedstuffs of animal or fish origin and amending Directive 90/425/EEC\u00a0(3) or disposed of by incineration.\n(4) Aid should be granted for the delivery to the competent German authorities of piglets from the zones concerned.\n(5) Provision should be made for the competent German authorities to apply all controls and surveillance measures required and to inform the Commission accordingly.\n(6) Restrictions on the free movement of piglets have applied for several weeks in the zones concerned and this situation has lead to a substantial increase in the animals' weight and has consequently brought about an intolerable animal-welfare situation. This Regulation should therefore apply from 12 June 2006.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 12 June 2006, producers of pigmeat may be eligible, on application, for aid granted by the competent German authorities on delivery to them of:\n(a) piglets covered by CN code 0103\u00a091\u00a010 and weighing 8\u00a0kg or more on average per batch (hereafter system piglets);\n(b) piglets covered by CN code 0103\u00a091\u00a010 and weighing 25\u00a0kg or more on average per batch.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050\u00a0% of the expenditure on the aid referred to in paragraph 1, covering a total maximum number of 65\u00a0000 piglets of which 13\u00a0000\u2018system piglets\u2019 at maximum, shall be financed by the Community budget.", "Only animals reared in the surveillance zones located within the regions referred to in Annex I may be delivered to the competent German authorities, provided that the veterinary measures established by the competent German authorities apply in those zones on the day the animals are delivered.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the day they are delivered to the competent German authorities, the animals shall be transported to the slaughterhouse, weighed and slaughtered in such a way as to prevent the disease from spreading.
