In that report it came to the conclusion that the novel chewing gum base can safely be used as a food ingredient.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 30 April 2009.\n(4) Within the 60 days period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.\n(5) Therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 2 July 2010.\n(6) On 25 March 2011, EFSA in the \u2018Scientific Opinion on the safety of a \u201cnovel chewing gum base (REV-7)\u201d as a novel food ingredient\u2019\u00a0(2) came to the conclusion that the novel chewing gum base was safe at the proposed conditions of use and the proposed levels of intake.\n(7) The novel chewing gum base complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 and therefore Commission Implementing Decision 2011/882/EU of 21 December 2011 authorising the placing on the market of a novel chewing gum base as a novel food ingredient under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) was adopted.\n(8) Article 2 of Implementing Decision 2011/882/EU provided that the designation of the novel chewing gum base authorised thereby on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018gum base (1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-homopolymer, maleated, esters with polyethylene glycol mono-Me ether)\u2019.\n(9) However, while the full chemical name provides for a clear and unambiguous designation of the substance, its length might dominate the labelling of the foodstuff containing it. As chewing gum is frequently sold in packages with limited space on the surface for labelling, it would be appropriate to provide a shorter alternative for the labelling.\n(10) The Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers (CAS No) are an international standard for the designation of chemicals, which provides equivalent information to that of the chemical name as regards the nature of the substance.\n(11) It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of the CAS registry number for the designation of the novel chewing gum base authorised by Implementing Decision 2011/882/EU on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it as an alternative to the full chemical name.\n(12) The Annex could have caused misunderstandings as in its title it provided only a part of the chemical name. Furthermore the CAS No should be given in the Annex.\n(13) Therefore, it appears appropriate to repeal and replace Implementing Decision 2011/882/EU by a new Decision with the abovementioned modifications.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The novel chewing gum base as specified in the Annex may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient for the use in chewing gum up to a maximum of 8\u00a0%.", "The designation of the novel chewing gum base authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018gum base (including 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-homopolymer, maleated, esters with polyethylene glycol mono-Me ether)\u2019 or \u2018gum base (including CAS No: 1246080-53-4)\u2019.", "Implementing Decision 2011/882/EU is hereby repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to Revolymer Ltd, 1, NewTech Square, Deeside Industrial Park, Deeside, Flintshire, CH5\u00a02NT, United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 August 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a043, 14.2.1997, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(4):2127.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 23.12.2011, p.\u00a0121.\nANNEX\nSpecifications of the novel chewing gum base\nDescription\nThe novel food ingredient is a synthetic polymer (Patent number WO2006016179).
