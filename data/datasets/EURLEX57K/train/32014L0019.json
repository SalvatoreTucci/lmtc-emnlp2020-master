From an impact assessment carried out by the European Commission it was concluded that no measures are feasible to eradicate it or to effectively prevent its further spread.\n(2) In addition, effective and sustainable means of control minimizing the impact of this organism on maize yield exist, in particular the implementation of a crop rotation scheme.\n(3) Therefore no further protective measures should be set out under Directive 2000/29/EC with respect to Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte. Consequently that organism should no more be listed as a harmful organism under that Directive.\n(4) Annex I to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2000/29/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 May 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
