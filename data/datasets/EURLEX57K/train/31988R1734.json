It shall inform the Commission of such designation.", "Exports to third countries\n1. When a chemical subject to notification is exported for the first time from the Community to a third country, the designated authority of the State, from which it is exported, shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the appropriate authorities of the country of destination receive notification of the fact. Such notification, which shall as far possible take place prior to export, must comply with the requirement set out in Annex II.\nThe designated authority shall send a copy of such notification to the Commission, which shall forward it to the designated authorities of the other Member States and to the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals (IRPTC).\nThe Commission shall assign a reference number to each notification received and communicate it immediately to the designated authorities of the Member States.
