The means of protection against this risk must be effective while accommodating the shape of the aircraft and avoiding damage to it.\n(4) Having examined standard EN 12312-9:2005, the Commission has established that it fails to meet the essential health and safety requirement 1.5.15 of Annex I to Directive 98/37/EC on the risk of slipping, tripping or falling, in conjunction with the essential health requirement 1.1.2(b) of that Annex on the principles of safety integration. In particular, clause 5.6 of the standard \u2018Crushing, shearing and falling\u2019, does not give specifications for the choice, design, location and construction of the means to be used to protect against falling from container and pallet loaders but only refers to the general specifications of EN 1915-1:2001, \u2018Aircraft ground support equipment \u2014 General requirements \u2014 Part 1: Basic safety requirements\u2019 which describe the various types of protection that can be used.\n(5) In the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of standard EN 12312-9:2005 should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate warning.\n(6) Member States should add an identical warning in their publication of the reference of national standards transposing standard EN 12312-9:2005,", "main_body": ["The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of standard EN 12312-9:2005 \u2018Aircraft ground support equipment \u2014 Specific requirements \u2014 Part 9: Container/Pallet loaders\u2019 shall be as set out in the Annex.", "Where, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 98/37/EC, Member States publish the reference of a national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 12312-9:2005, they shall add to that publication a warning identical to that set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 336, 31.12.2005, p. 12.\nANNEX\nPublication of titles and references of European harmonised standards under Directive 98/37/EC\nESO\u00a0(1) Reference and title of the harmonised standard First publication OJ Reference of superseded standard Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of superseded standard\nCEN EN 12312-9:2005 31.12.2005 \u2014\nWarning: This publication does not concern clause 5.6 of the standard, the application of which does not confer a presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirement 1.5.15 of Annex I to Directive 98/37/EC, in conjunction with the requirement 1.1.2(b) of that Annex.\nNote 1 Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal (dow), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise.\nNote:\n\u2014 any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to the Directive 98/34/EC,\n\u2014 publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\nMore information about harmonised standards on the Internet at:\nhttp://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0ESO: European Standards Organisation:\n\u2014 CEN: rue de Stassart/de Stassartstraat 36, 1050 Bruxelles/Brussel, Belgique/Belgi\u00eb, t\u00e9l./tel. +\u00a032 25500811; fax +\u00a032 25500819 (http://www.cen.eu)."}
