Since the amendment is minor within the meaning of the third subparagraph of Article 53(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, the Commission may approve it without following the procedure set out in Articles 50 to 52 of the Regulation,", "main_body": ["The specification for the protected geographical indication \u2018Nieheimer K\u00e4se\u2019 is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nOn behalf of the President,\nDacian CIOLO\u0218\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 14.12.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0119, 13.5.2010, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nThe following amendment to the specification for the protected geographical indication \u2018Nieheimer K\u00e4se\u2019 is approved:\nMethod of production:\nJustification:\nThe requester, an association of producers of the product in question, contends that over the 65 years in which \u2018Nieheimer K\u00e4se\u2019 has been produced, the addition of caraway seed has always represented 0,1-0,3 %.\nThe quantity mentioned in the summary published in the Official Journal of the European Union in this connection (\u20180,01-0,03\u2019) is the result of a drafting error. The missing % sign was added upon publication in the Deutsches Markenblatt of 23 September 2005. The extra zeros after the comma would result in a corresponding addition of caraway seed (of only one to three ten thousandths of the total weight) to the product, which would be barely perceptible."}
