The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive.\n(2) Developments in technology now permit an adaptation of Directive 93/92/EEC to technical progress. In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is therefore necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of the Directive concerned.\n(3) To this end, it should be specified that lighting devices type-approved for vehicles in categories M1 and N1, in accordance with the relevant directives, may also be installed on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles. Provision should also be made to permit the optional installation of front fog lamps, rear fog lamps, reversing lamps and hazard warning devices on three-wheel mopeds and light quadricycles. Directive 93/92/EEC should be supplemented with the appropriate instructions for installing these devices. The wording of certain points in the English and Dutch versions should be aligned on the corresponding points in the other language versions.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4), as last amended by Directive 2000/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5),", "main_body": ["Annexes II to VI to Directive 93/92/EEC are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
