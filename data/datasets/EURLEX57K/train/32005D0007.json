Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus called \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 mm at the blade of the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO) and photodetector of the type 58 MR and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:"}
