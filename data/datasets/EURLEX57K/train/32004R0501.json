That report also stated that high priority should be given to short-term public finance statistics for Member States, in particular those participating in Economic and Monetary Union, and that the objective was the compilation of quarterly government financial accounts following a step-by-step approach.\n(3) Quarterly national data of financial accounts (transactions and balance sheets) for the government sector make up a large proportion of all financial transactions and financial balance sheets in the euro area and provide important information to support the conduct of monetary policy. In this respect and for its own purpose the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has adopted regulations and guidelines to safeguard the transmission of infra-annual data on financial statistics and national financial accounts to the European Central Bank.\n(4) Counterpart sector information on government financial transactions and balance sheets is required to enable comprehensive analysis of government financing and financial investment by counterpart sector and by instrument.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to short-term public finance statistics(4) and Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 10 June 2002 on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government(5) specify the non-financial quarterly data for general government that is to be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) by Member States.\n(6) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 lay down the conditions under which the Commission may adopt amendments to the methodology of the European System of Accounts in order to clarify and improve its contents. The compilation of government quarterly financial accounts will require additional resources in Member States, and cannot therefore be dealt with by a Commission Decision but should rather be adopted by a specific Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(7) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(6), and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB) set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC,(7) declared themselves in favour of the draft of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to list and define the main characteristics of the European System of Accounts (ESA 95) categories of financial transactions and of financial assets and liabilities for the general government sector and for each of the subsectors within general government, to be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) quarterly following a step-by-step approach.", "Compilation of quarterly data: sources and methods\n1.
