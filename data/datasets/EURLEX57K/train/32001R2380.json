Such protection should however be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(3).\n(6) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety and with regard to the favourable effect on animal production of the coccidiostat under the conditions described in the said Annex.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Feedingstuffs,", "main_body": ["The additive belonging to the \"Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\" listed in the Annex to the present Regulation is authorised for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 15 December 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 234, 1.9.2001, p. 55.\n(3) OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
