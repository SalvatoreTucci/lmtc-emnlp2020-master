Objectives\nThe TIDE Community initiative is a technology promotion and application initiative with the specific main objective of 'stimulating the creation of an internal market in rehabilitation technology in Europe to facilitate the socio-economic integration of  disabled and elderly people'.\nThis will be achieved through the collaborative activities of multidisciplinary teams. The detailed objectives of those activities are:\n- understanding, making clear and adapting technology to respond to the needs of the user groups,\n- developing new applications for rehabilitation technology such as intelligent houses for elderly people, advanced hearing aids, etc.,\n- encouraging innovation and technology transfer in rehabilitation technology,\n- accelerating the development of technical norms and standards.\nII. Scope of measures to encourage the emergence of the internal market in rehabilitation technology\nThe scope of the TIDE initiative is described by the four action lines, each with their respective work areas. These are:\n1. access to communication and information technology and support for interpersonal communication: access to and interaction with multimedia environments; technology to facilitate personal communications; accessible services and applications;\n2. environmental control technologies for daily living: user and system interfaces; robotics systems; mobility and transport control systems;\n3. restoration and enhancement of motor and cognitive functions: IT for individualized plans for assessment, rehabilitation and maintenance in the Community; technology for rehabilitation and maintenance of motor functions; substitution devices for  motor functions;\n4. integrated system technologies: smart environments and systems; orientation and navigation system for mobility; working environments for disabled and elderly people.\nThe major activity will be set of technology promotion and application projects. All projects are expected to participate in the TIDE initiative horizontal activities. These include consensus, market study, cost benefit and effectiveness and  standardization activities. Horizontal activities will cover a solution framework, a cost-benefit model, a market factors model and information activities. A set of common responsibilities will be placed on the individual projects, largely consisting of  validating the models provided and providing data. Projects will also be expected to provide for the dissemination and exploitation of their own results.\nThe work to be carried out conforms to the basic principles of market and customer focused technology promotion which in TIDE are explicitely elaborated as five interlinked principles. They are:\n- user-focused principle; users are to be involved in projects. Projects should deliver statements of end user requirements and make statements of anticipated benefits of the technological solution to the end users (both the disabled and elderly as well  as care personnel),\n- market oriented principle; projects will take advantage of the opportunities presented by the completion of the internal market and will lead to the development of technology based prototype products and services,\n- innovation and technology adaptation principle: emphasis is to be on innovation and the adaptation and advanced application of new technology and its integration with appropriate international standards,\n- multi-disciplinary approach principle: projects will harness the scarce scientific, technical and commercial resources in a field which requires social, economic, educational and clinical expertise as well as technological expertise,\n- technology verification principle; technology application is to be evaluated with real or potential consumers in field trials or by using scenarios.\nANNEX II\nIndicative breakdown of the amount deemed necessary\n/* Tables: see OJ */\nANNEX III\nGeneral rules for implementation of the initiative and the amount of the Community's financial contribution  1. The initiative shall be implemented on the basis of the objectives and scope set out in Annex I.\n2. The initiative shall be implemented by means of shared-cost actions and horizontal activities (study contracts).\n3. Contracts must be concluded following a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n4. For shared-cost contracts, Community financial participation shall not exceed 50 %. Universities and other similar organizations participating in shared-cost projects will have the option of requesting either 50 % funding of total expenditure or 100  % of the additional marginal costs.\n5. For horizontal activities (study contracts) Community participation may be up to 100 %.\n6. To be eligible, shared-cost actions must involve participation of at least two independent partners established in different Member States. At least two of the partners in a project should be industrial undertakings."}
