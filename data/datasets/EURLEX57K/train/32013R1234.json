In accordance with Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 807/2010\u00a0(4), the implementation period of an annual plan is to begin on 1 October and to finish on 31 December of the following year. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived when it is established in 2014, notably in terms of delivery of support, and in accordance with the requests that the Commission received from Spain, Poland and Slovenia an extension of the implementation period of the 2013 annual plan for the distribution of food for the benefit of the most deprived persons seems appropriate. In order to ensure equal treatment, the extension should be applicable for all Member States.\n(3) As a result of judicial procedures launched against tender procedures, Greece has faced delays in the signature of public procurement contracts and has accordingly requested the extension of the deadline to submit payment requests mentioned in the first paragraph of Article 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012. In view of this request and of the difficult financial situation faced by Greece, it is appropriate to allow this extension. In order to ensure equal treatment, the derogation should apply to all Member States. As the deadline for the submission of payment requests was set at 30 September, this derogation should apply retrospectively.\n(4) For accounting purposes, the advances paid by the Paying Agencies to beneficiaries as well as the clearing of advances at beneficiary level should be booked in the Commission\u2019s annual accounts. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Member States to fix the date by which the beneficiaries of those payments should submit costs statements and certain other information related to advance payments. In addition, it is appropriate to set the deadline of the data provision from the Member States to the Commission as 1 February 2014, which corresponds to the deadline applicable to the provision of accounting information referred to in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006\u00a0(5).\n(5) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) the following Article 1a is inserted:\n(2) in Article 4, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 5 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1, point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) they have taken all measures to ensure that the implementation shall be completed not later than 28 February 2014.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraph 5a is inserted:\n(a) costs statements justifying, by cost item, the use of the advances until 15 October 2013; and\n(b) a confirmation, by cost item, of the balance of unused advances remaining on 15 October 2013.\n(c) paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nPoint 2 of Article 1 shall apply from 30 September 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 121/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2012 amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union (OJ L 44, 16.2.2012, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012 of 6 November 2012 adopting the plan allocating to the Member States resources to be charged to the 2013 budget year for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the European Union and derogating from certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 (OJ L 307, 7.11.2012, p. 62).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 of 14 September 2010 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Union (OJ L 242, 15.9.2010, p. 9).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD (OJ L 171, 23.6.2006, p. 90).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD (OJ L 171, 23.6.2006, p. 90).\u2019"}
