These purity criteria are more complete but nevertheless correspond to those laid down in Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(5), as last amended by Directive 2002/82/EC(6).\n(5) To ensure a high degree of quality, and in particular to preserve the authenticity and the natural character of wine in compliance with good oenological practice, the requirement that tartaric acid which may be used in wine-making must be of agricultural origin, taking account of the specifications of the International Vine and Wine Office's International Oenological Codex, should be incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["The following paragraph is added to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000:\"Tartaric acid, the use of which is provided for in Annex IV(1)(l) and (m) and Annex IV(3)(k) and (l) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, also called L-tartaric acid, must be of agricultural origin and extracted specifically from wine products.
