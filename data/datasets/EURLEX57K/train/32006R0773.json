Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the micro-organism preparation of Kluyveromyces marxianus-fragilis B0399 MUCL 41579 for piglets. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) expressed its opinion on the use of this preparation on 28 January 2004. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised for four years.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 600.94) is authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and piglets, as enzyme E1609 in coated, liquid and solid forms by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1453/2004\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to ducks and to include in the authorisation for this animal species a granulate form. EFSA delivered an opinion on 30 November 2005 on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised for four years.\n(7) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of a granulate form of the enzyme E1609 for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and piglets. EFSA expressed its opinion on the use of this preparation on 30 November 2005. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(4).\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex III, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 May 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
