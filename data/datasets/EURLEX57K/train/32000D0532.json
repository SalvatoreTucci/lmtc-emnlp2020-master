The concentration limits refer to those laid down in Council Directive 88/379/EEC of 7 June 1998 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (OJ L 187, 16.7.1988, p. 14.) and its subsequent amendments.\nANNEX\nList of wastes pursuant to Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and Article 1(4) of Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste\nIntroduction\n1. The present list is a harmonised list of wastes. It will be periodically reviewed and if necessary revised in accordance with Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC. However, the inclusion of a material in the list does not mean that the material is a waste in all circumstances. Materials are considered to be waste only where the definition of waste in Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC is met.\n2. Wastes included in the list are subject to the provisions of Directive 75/442/EEC except where Article 2(1)(b) of this Directive applies.\n3. The different types of waste in the list are fully defined by the six-digit code for the waste and the respective two-digit and four-digit chapter headings. This implies that the following steps should be taken to identify a waste in the list.\n3.1. Identify the source generating the waste in Chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20 and identify the appropriate six-digit code of the waste (excluding codes ending with 99 of these chapters). Note that a specific production unit may need to classify its activities in several chapters. For instance, a car manufacturer may find its wastes listed in Chapters 12 (wastes from shaping and surface treatment of metals), 11 (inorganic wastes containing metals from metal treatment and the coating of metals) and 08 (wastes from the use of coatings), depending on the different process steps.\n3.2. If no appropriate waste code can be found in Chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20 the Chapters 13, 14 and 15 must be examined to identify the waste.\n3.3. If none of these waste codes apply, the waste must be identified according to Chapter 16.\n3.4. If the waste is not in Chapter 16 either, the 99 code (wastes not otherwise specified) must be used in the section of the list corresponding to the activity identified in step one.\n4. Any waste marked with an asterisk (*) is considered as a hazardous waste pursuant to Article 1(4), first indent, of Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and subject to the provisions of that Directive unless Article 1(5) of that Directive applies.\n5. For the purpose of this Decision, \"dangerous substance\" means any substance that has been or will be classified as dangerous in Directive 67/548/EEC as amended; \"heavy metal\" means any compound of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium (VI), copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, tellurium, thallium and tin, including these metals in metallic form, as far as these are classified as dangerous substances.\n6. If a waste is identified as hazardous by a specific or general reference to dangerous substances, the waste is hazardous only if the concentrations of those substances are such (i.e. percentage by weight) that the waste presents one or more of the properties listed in Annex III to Council Directive 91/689/EEC. As regards H3 to H8, H10 and H11, Article 2 of this Decision applies. For the characteristics H1, H2, H9 and H12 to H14 Article 2 of the present Decision does not provide specifications at present.\n7. The following rules for numbering of the items in the list have been used: For those wastes that were not changed the code numbers from Decision 94/3/EC have been used; The codes for waste that were changed have been deleted and remain unused in order to avoid confusion after implementation of the new list; Wastes added have been given a code that was not used in Decision 94/3/EC.\nINDEX\nChapters of the list\nTwo-digit\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>"}
