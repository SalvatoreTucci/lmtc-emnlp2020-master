Those field inspections should therefore continue to be considered as equivalent.\n(3) As Decision 2003/17/EC will expire on 31 December 2007, the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision should be extended. It appears desirable to limit that period to five years.\n(4) Decision 2003/17/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Decision 2003/17/EC, \u201831 December 2007\u2019 shall be replaced by \u201831 December 2012\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 November 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
