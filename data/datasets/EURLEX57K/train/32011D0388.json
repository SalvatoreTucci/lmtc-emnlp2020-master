As a consequence, Bulgaria has taken measures in the framework of Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 September 2003 on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease\u00a0(3).\n(2) In addition, Commission Decision 2011/44/EU of 19 January 2011 concerning certain protection measures against foot-and-mouth disease in Bulgaria\u00a0(4) was adopted, as it was necessary to reinforce the control measures taken by Bulgaria. That Decision is to apply until 30 June 2011.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2011/44/EU lists the areas in Bulgaria where cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been confirmed. The areas surrounding those areas are listed in Annex II to that Decision. The protection measures laid down in Decision 2011/44/EU differ depending on whether an area is listed in Annex I or in Annex II to that Decision.\n(4) Annex I to Decision 2011/44/EU currently lists the region of Burgas and Annex II to that Decision lists the regions of Kardjali, Haskovo, Yambol, Sliven, Shumen and Varna.\n(5) As no new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported in Bulgaria since 7 April 2011 and surveillance carried out in the areas listed in Annex I and Annex II has not revealed foot-and-mouth disease infection in domestic animals of species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, it is appropriate to reduce the areas under restriction listed in Annexes I and II to Decision 2011/44/EU, respectively.\n(6) However, surveillance in accordance with point 4(g) of Part B of Annex XVIII to Directive 2003/85/EC to rule out infection of wildlife with the foot-and-mouth disease virus cannot be completed until at least maternal antibodies have vanished in susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease wild animals born in that area after the first case of that disease was reported in January 2011.\n(7) It is therefore necessary to prolong the application of the measures laid down in Decision 2011/44/EU until 30 September 2011.\n(8) Decision 2011/44/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2011/44/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 16, the date \u201830 June 2011\u2019 is
