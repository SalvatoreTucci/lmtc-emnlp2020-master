In parallel, Member States have developed computer systems at national level to meet the requirements of shared management of the CAP.\n(3) In this context and given the need to ensure uniform and harmonised management of the CAP by all those involved, a legal framework should be established and provide for common rules applicable to the information systems set up for the purpose of notifying information and documents to the Commission from the Member States and the authorities or bodies designated by them under the CAP.\n(4) For these objectives to be achieved effectively, the scope of this legal framework should be defined, both in terms of the legislation and the actors concerned.\n(5) With regard to the legislation, Regulations (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 1405/2006, (EC) No 1234/2007, (EC) No 3/2008 and (EC) No 73/2009 and their implementing provisions (hereafter CAP Regulations) lay down a wide range of obligations for the Member States to notify to the Commission information and documents needed for the implementation of those Regulations. Therefore, they should be taken into account in accordance with their own specific features.\n(6) As regards the actors involved, the rights and obligations laid down by the CAP Regulations, both for the Commission and for Member States and their competent authorities and bodies, require precise identification of the individuals and authorities responsible for actions and measures taken.\n(7) The CAP Regulations generally provide that information should be transmitted electronically or by means of an information system but do not necessarily specify the principles that apply. To ensure consistency and sound management and simplify the procedures for users and the authorities responsible for the systems, it is therefore desirable to establish common principles applicable to all information systems set up.\n(8) For documents to be recognised as valid for the Commission's purposes and in the Member States, it should be possible to guarantee the authenticity, integrity and legibility over time of the documents and the associated metadata throughout the period for which they are required to be kept.\n(9) With a view to providing that guarantee, the authorities or individuals authorised to send communications should always be identified in the information systems set up, based on the powers allocated to them. The identification process must be under the responsibility of the competent authorities referred to in each of the CAP Regulations. However, in the interests of sound management, it should be left to the Member States and the Commission to determine the conditions for designating authorised individuals, providing for designation through a single liaison body. Furthermore, the conditions for granting access rights to information systems set up by the Commission should be determined.\n(10) Given the wide range of notification obligations addressed under the scope of this Regulation, the information systems will be progressively made available to the competent authorities of the Member States. The obligation to notify through those information systems should be applicable when the corresponding provisions of the CAP Regulations provide for the application of this Regulation.\n(11) Documents must be managed in accordance with the personal data protection rules. To that end, the general rules laid down by Community legislation, notably Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(6), Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)\u00a0(7), Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents\u00a0(8) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(9), should apply.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments and the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation lays down rules applicable to the notification, through information systems, of information and documents (hereinafter documents) as required to meet communication obligations by the Member States to the Commission, pursuant to:\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 and its implementing rules,\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 and its implementing rules,\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and its implementing rules,\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 and its implementing rules,\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and its implementing rules,", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a) \u2018notification obligation\u2019 means the obligation to submit documents from the Member States to the Commission, provided for in the Community legislation referred to in Article 1;\n(b) \u2018competent authorities\u2019 means the authorities or bodies designated by the Member States as responsible for fulfilling the notification obligation;\n(c) \u2018authority responsible for the information systems\u2019 means the authority, department, body or person that is responsible in the Commission for validating and using the system and is identified as such in that system;\n(d) \u2018metadata\u2019 means the data describing the context, contents and structure of documents and their management over time.\nCHAPTER II\nCOMMISSION INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ACCESS RIGHTS AND AUTHENTICITY OF DOCUMENTS", "Commission information systems\nTo fulfil the notification obligation, documents shall be notified to the Commission by means of the information systems made available to the competent authorities, hereinafter referred to as \u2018information systems\u2019, as from the date that the corresponding notification obligation provides for the obligation to use those systems in accordance with this Regulation.", "Access rights and single liaison body\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Granting access rights and certifying the identity of those authorised to access the information systems (hereinafter users) shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards access to the systems, each Member State shall:\n(a) designate a single liaison body responsible for:\n(i) validating, for each system, the access rights granted and updated by the competent authorities and the certified identity of the users authorised to have an access to the systems;\n(ii) notifying the Commission of the competent authorities and users authorised to access the systems;\n(b) inform the Commission of the identity and contact details of the liaison body it has designated.\nAfter access rights have been validated, they shall be activated by the authority responsible for the information systems.", "Establishment and notification of documents\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The documents shall be set up and notified in accordance with the procedures established by the information systems, using models or methods made available to users through those information systems, under the responsibility of the competent authority of the Member State and in accordance with the access rights granted by the authorities in question.
