At the same time the Court ordered the effects of Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 to be maintained, so far as concerns Mr Kadi and the Al Barakaat International Foundation, for a period that may not exceed three months running from the date of delivery of the judgment. This period was granted to allow a possibility to remedy the infringements found.\n(3) In order to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice, the Commission has communicated the narrative summaries of reasons provided by the UN Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, to Mr Kadi and to Al Barakaat International Foundation and given them the opportunity to comment on these grounds in order to make their point of view known.\n(4) The Commission has received comments by Mr Kadi and by Al Barakaat International Foundation and examined these comments.\n(5) The list of persons, groups and entities to whom the freezing of funds and economic resources should apply, drawn up by the UN Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, includes Mr Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation.\n(6) After having carefully considered the comments received from Mr Kadi in a letter dated 10 November 2008, and given the preventive nature of the freezing of funds and economic resources, the Commission considers that the listing of Mr Kadi is justified for reasons of his association with the Al-Qaida network.\n(7) After having carefully considered the comments received from Al Barakaat International Foundation in a letter dated 9 November 2008, and given the preventive nature of the freezing of funds and economic resources, the Commission considers the listing of Al Barakaat International Foundation is justified for reasons of its association with the Al-Qaida network.\n(8) In view of this, Mr Kadi and the Al Barakaat International Foundation should be added to Annex I.\n(9) This Regulation should apply from 30 May 2002, given the preventive nature and objectives of the freezing of funds and economic resources under Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 and the need to protect legitimate interests of the economic operators, who have been relying on the legality of the annulled Regulation,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 3 December 2008.
