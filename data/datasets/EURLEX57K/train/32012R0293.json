As those data are to serve as the basis for determining the specific CO2 emissions target for manufacturers of new light commercial vehicles and for the assessment of whether manufacturers comply with those targets, it is necessary to harmonise the rules on the collection and reporting of those data.\n(2) To allow for the future inclusion in Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of vehicles in categories M2 and N2 in accordance with Article 13(2) of that Regulation, data for those categories of vehicles should be recorded and transmitted to the Commission.\n(3) In order to assess fully whether each manufacturer complies with its specific CO2 emissions target established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 and to gain the necessary experience from the application of that Regulation, the Commission needs detailed data at manufacturer level for each vehicle series defined by type, variant and version. Member States should therefore ensure that such data are recorded and transmitted to the Commission together with the aggregated data in accordance with Article 8(2) of that Regulation.\n(4) Pursuant to Articles 18 and 26 of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles\u00a0(2), a manufacturer must ensure that each new light commercial vehicle placed on the market in the Union is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity and a Member State may not register such a vehicle unless it is accompanied by such a certificate of conformity. Therefore, the certificate of conformity should be the primary source for the information that the Member States are required to record, make available to manufacturers pursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 and report to the Commission. In certain justified cases, Member States may also use information from sources other than the certificate of conformity, provided that the accuracy of those sources is equivalent to the certificate of conformity and, where necessary, that the Member States concerned put measures in place to guarantee that accuracy.\n(5) The data on the registration of new light commercial vehicles should be accurate and should be processed effectively for the purpose of establishing the specific emissions target in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. Manufacturers should therefore provide the Commission with up-to-date information on the manufacturers\u2019 names that are used on the certificates of conformity in the different Member States of registration. That information will enable the Commission to provide the Member States with an up-dated list of designated manufacturers\u2019 names which should be used for the purpose of data reporting.\n(6) Member States should record and report information about newly registered vehicles that are designed to use alternative fuels. In order to allow the Commission to take into account reductions to the specific emissions target due to the use of ethanol (E85) fuel in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, Member States should provide the Commission with the necessary information, including the proportion of filling stations in their territory and, where applicable, the total number of those which provide ethanol (E85) fuel meeting the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC\u00a0(3), and in Article 7b of Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC\u00a0(4).\n(7) In order to avoid unnecessary data duplication, the information on the number of filling stations in the respective territory of the Member States that supply ethanol (E85) fuel provided in accordance with Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1014/2010 of 10 November 2010 on monitoring and reporting of data on the registration of new passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) should be used for the purposes of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011.\n(8) Articles 23 and 24 of Directive 2007/46/EC provide for a simplified approval procedure for which it is not required to issue a European certificate of conformity. Member States should monitor the number of vehicles registered under those procedures in order to assess its impact on the monitoring process and the attainment of the Union\u2019s average CO2 emissions target for the new light commercial vehicle fleet.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Implementing Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation sets out the rules for collection and reporting of data on registrations of the following vehicles:\n(a) light commercial vehicles as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011;\n(b) vehicles of categories M2 and N2 as referred to in Article 8(10) of that Regulation.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 as well as the definitions of \u2018bi-fuel gas vehicle\u2019 and \u2018flex-fuel ethanol vehicle\u2019 set out in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008\u00a0(6) shall apply.
