That is correctly reflected under the specific conditions listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC under which the use of veterinary certificates BOV, OVI, RUW and RUF is authorised for that territory. However, the list of third countries and parts thereof in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision as shown in the row relevant to the territory of AR-4 is not consistent with that. Therefore RUW and RUF should be inserted in that row for clarity and consistency.\n(3) The date of application relevant to the geographic and timing restrictions concerning the territory of AR-8 has been incorrectly stated and may lead to confusion. For the sake of clarity the date of application in the specific conditions table for the unauthorised period should be corrected to 17 March 2005.\n(4) The Murmansk region of Russia is authorised for importation to the Community meat of farmed non-domestic animals other than suidae and solipeds. Russia has asked the Commission to include the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area in the list of third countries or parts thereof from which the fresh meat of farmed reindeer may be imported into the Community.\n(5) Following that request a mission was carried out in the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) from 22 to 26 November 2004. The conclusion of that mission is that the animal health situation in the area is satisfactory and that the competent veterinary authority provides appropriate guarantees as regards compliance with Community legislation, in particular the items mentioned in Article 8 paragraph 1 of Directive 2002/99/EC. Furthermore, Russia provided an action plan addressing all the recommendations of the mission report in a satisfactory way.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to list the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area as being authorised to import into the Community the fresh meat of farmed non-domestic animals other than suidae and solipeds.\n(7) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the 30th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply immediately.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 14.6.1979, p. 15.
