It is the case, in particular, when the classification of each type of goods in a movement for the purpose of drawing up the customs declaration would entail a workload and expense disproportionate to the interests at stake.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 113/2010 \u03bff 9 February 2010 implementing Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries, as regards trade coverage, definition of the data, compilation of statistics on trade by business characteristics and by invoicing currency, and specific goods or movements\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1982/2004 of 18 November 2004 implementing Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Commission Regulations (EC) No 1901/2000 and (EEC) No 3590/92\u00a0(4) allow the Member States to use a simplified coding system for certain goods in the extra-EU and intra-EU trade statistics.\n(5) Those regulations provide for specific goods codes to be used under special conditions. For the sake of transparency as well as for information purposes, such codes should be mentioned in the CN.\n(6) For these reasons, it is appropriate to insert Chapter 99 in the CN.\n(7) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 1 January 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 December 2010.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 324, 10.12.2009, p. 23.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 10.2.2010, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 19.11.2004, p. 3.\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is amended as follows:\n(1) in the Summary, Part Two, Section XXI, Chapter 99, the phrase \u2018(Reserved for special uses determined by the competent Community authorities)\u2019 is replaced by the following: \u2018Special Combined Nomenclature codes\u2019;\n(2) in Part Two, Section XXI, between the end of Chapter 98 and \u2018Part Three\u2019, the following \u2018Chapter 99\u2019 is inserted:\n1.
