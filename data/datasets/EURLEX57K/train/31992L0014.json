The objective of this Directive is to restrict the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes as specified in Article 2.\n2.  This Directive shall apply to aeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass of 34 000 kg or more with a certified maximum internal accommodation for the aeroplane type in question consisting of more than nineteen passenger seats, excluding any seats for  crew only.", "1.  Member States shall ensure that, as from 1 April 1995, civil subsonic jet aeroplanes fitted with engines having a by-pass ratio of less than two cannot operate at airports situated in their territory unless granted noise certification  either:\n(a) to the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 3, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988); or\n(b) to the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the aforesaid Convention, provided that they were first issued an individual certificate of airworthiness less than 25 years previously.\n2.

Member States shall exempt from Article 2 (1) aeroplanes which do not meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 but which can be altered to meet those standards, provided that:\n(a) suitable conversion equipment exists and is actually available for the aeroplane type in question;\n(b) aeroplanes fitted with such equipment meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16, as determined in accordance with the technical standards and procedures accepted by the Member States until such time as common standards and procedures are  established at Community level;\n(c) the airline has ordered the equipment by 1 April 1994;\n(d) the airline has accepted the earliest delivery date for such alterations.\n2.  Member States may grant exemptions from Article 2 for aeroplanes of historical interest.", "Member States may grant, on the basis of the principle of one exemption for each aeroplane ordered, exemptions from the provisions of Article 2 (1) for aeroplanes where an order has been placed before 1 April 1994 for a replacement aeroplane  that meets the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16, provided that the airline accepted the earlist delivery date.", "Subject to the approval of the competent authority of a Member State, airlines may not be required under Article 2 (1) to delete from the registers aeroplanes which do not meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 at an annual rate  equivalent to more than 10 % of their total civil subsonic jet fleet.", "In individual cases, Member States may permit the temporary use at airports situated in their territory of aeroplanes which cannot be operated on the basis of the other provisions of this Directive. This exemption should be limited to:\n(a) aeroplanes whose operations are of such an exceptional nature that it would be unreasonable to withhold a temporary exemption;\n(b) aeroplanes on non-revenue flights for the purposes of alterations, repair or maintenance.", "1.  Any Member State granting exemptions under Article 4 to 7 shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission of the fact and of the grounds for its decision.\n2.  Any Member State shall recognize the exemptions granted by another Member State in respect of aeroplanes on the registers of the latter.", "0\n1.
