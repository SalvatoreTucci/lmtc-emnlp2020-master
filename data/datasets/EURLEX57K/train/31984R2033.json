whereas paragraph 2 of the same Article provides that the aid system can also be applied to the use of grapes of Community origin; whereas juice manufacturing practices are such that the aid should also be given for the use of such grapes;\nWhereas application of the aid system requires administrative provisions for checking the origin and use of the products for which aid is given;\nWhereas the purpose of the aid scheme is to promote the use of products of Community origin for the manufacture of grape juice in place of imported products; whereas the aid should therefore be given to users of the raw material, i.e. to processors;\nWhereas in order to ensure that the aid system functions properly and that the checks can be properly carried out, processors should be required to lodge written declarations giving the information necessary for identification of the product and to enable checks on the operations to be carried out;\nWhereas, in order for the aid system to have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity which may be covered by a declaration should be set for each product;\nWhereas it should be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the quality characteristics required for processing into grape juice; whereas it is consequently necessary to prescribe that grapes and grape must covered by a declaration must have a density of between 1,055 and 1,085 g/cm3 at 20 \u00c2\u00b0C;\nWhereas Article 14a (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 sets out criteria for fixing the amount of the aid; whereas application of these criteria gives the aid rates for the various products in question fixed below;\nWhereas, to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to make the necessary checks, obligations on processors in regard to the keeping of stock records should be laid down, in addition to the provisions of Title II of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (4), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece;\nWhereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas to allow for technical losses the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;\nWhereas for control purposes it is necessary to adopt a processing coefficient as between the grapes employed and the grape juice obtained, based on normal processing methods;\nWhereas, in order to be paid aid, applicants must lodge an application accompanied by a number of supporting documents; whereas to ensure that the system operates uniformly in all Member States, time limits for lodging applications and for payment of aid to processors should be laid down;\nWhereas the second subparagraph of Article 48 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 states that grape juice may not be made into wine or added to wine; whereas, in order to ensure that this prohibition is complied with, special obligations and checks should be specified for processors of and bottlers of grape juice;\nWhereas to prevent discrimination between operators and to resolve certain uncertainties as to interpretation that may arise with regard to the representative rates to be applied under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1054/78 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 899/84 (2), it should be specified that for all operations under this Regulation the representative rates applicable should in all cases be those applying in the wine sector on 1 September 1984;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["1. For the 1984/85 wine-growing year, aid shall be granted in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation to processors:\n- who purchase grapes grown in the Community or grape must or concentrated grape must produced entirely from grapes grown in the Community from producers or producer groups for the purpose of manufacturing grape juice, or\n- who, being themselves producers or producer groups, use their own production of these products for the purpose of manufacturing grape juice.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation, 'product' means grapes grown in the Community and grape must and concentrated grape must produced entirely from grapes grown in the Community.\n3. Processing operations must be carried out between 1 September 1984 and 31 August 1985.", "1.

In addition, where bottling of grape juice is carried out in the Community by a person other than the processor, the latter shall submit to the competent authority.\n- a declaration by the bottler that he has taken the grape juice over, indicating the date on which he did so,\n- a copy of any accompanying document drawn up for transport of the juice.\nIf bottling was carried out outside the Community, the processor shall submit to the competent authority a copy of the accompanying document showing in box 23 the customs stamp certifying exportation.\nThe supporting documents referred to in the first and second subparagraphs and the copy or summary referred to in the second indent of paragraph 1 shall be submitted not later than six months after the bottler has taken over the grape juice or after the grape juice has been exported, as appropriate.\n5. The cases as referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, the bottler shall keep stock records as prescribed in Title II of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75, showing:\n- the quantities of grape juice entering his premises each day and the name and address of the processor,\n- the quantities of grape juice bottled each day,\n- the quantities of bottled grape juice leaving his premises each day and the name and address of each consignee.", "The competent authority shall pay aid for the quantity of product actually processed not later than three months after receipt of all the supporting documents specified in Article 6. Article 8\n1. Entitlement to the aid shall be acquired when the grapes, grape must or concentrated grape must have been used for the purpose indicated in Article 1.\n2. Conversion of the amounts indicated in Article 4 into national currencies shall be at the representative rates applying on 1 September 1984.", "1. Except in case of force majeure, if the processor does not process the quantity of product covered by the declaration (allowing for the tolerance mentioned in Article 6 (2)), no aid shall be payable.\n2. Except in case of force majeure, if the processor does not fulfil one of the obligations under this Regulation other than that to process the product covered by the declaration into grape juice, the aid payable shall be reduced by an amount fixed by the competent authority in proportion to the seriousness of the infringement.\n3. In cases of force majeure, the competent authority shall take such action as it considers necessary having regard to the circumstances invoked.\n4.
