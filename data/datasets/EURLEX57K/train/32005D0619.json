However in view of the proximity with the outbreak in Russia it is probably the same strain.\n(5) Kazakhstan and Russia are members of the OIE and accordingly Member States are to accept imports of birds, other than poultry, from these countries under Decision 2000/666/EC. Taking into account the potential serious consequences related to the specific avian influenza virus strain (H5N1) involved, which is the same as that confirmed in a number of Asian countries, the importation of these birds from Kazakhstan and Russia should be suspended as a precautionary measure.\n(6) Under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption\u00a0(5), the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers originating in Kazakhstan and Russia is authorised. In view of the current disease situation in Kazakhstan and Russia those imports should also be suspended as a precautionary measure.\n(7) Article 4 of Decision 2004/122/EC suspends the importation from certain third countries of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers and live birds other than poultry, as defined in Decision 2000/666/EC. Therefore in the interests of animal and public health, Kazakhstan and Russia should be added to the third countries referred to in Article 4 of Decision 2004/122/EC.\n(8) Decision 2004/122/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/122/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in the title, \u2018concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in several Asian countries\u2019 is replaced by \u2018concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in several third countries\u2019;\n2.
