Prepared oil (containing evening primrose oil, milk-fat and vitamin E), presented in gelatine capsules and used as a food supplement, was classified under heading 1517, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3513/92 of 3 December 1992 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature\u00a0(3).\n(2) In joined Cases C-410/08 to C-412/08 Swiss Caps AG v Hauptzollamt Singen\n\u00a0(4), the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that products presented in capsules and intended for use as a food supplement should be classified under heading 2106, as food preparations not elsewhere specified or included.\n(3) As a consequence, it is appropriate to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1858/98 and Regulation (EEC) No 3513/92, in order to avoid divergent tariff classification and to ensure the uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature within the European Union.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1858/98 and Regulation (EEC) No 3513/92 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) In addition to the above corrections, it is necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2009 of 26 November 2009 amending or repealing certain regulations on the classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature\u00a0(5).
