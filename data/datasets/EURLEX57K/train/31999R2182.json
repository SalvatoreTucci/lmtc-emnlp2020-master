Furthermore, since experience has also shown that some operators have lodged applications for speculative reasons for quantities far exceeding their requirements and as this practice is liable to damage operators who apply only for the quantities they really need, the quantity that individual exporters can apply for should be limited to the quantity available for each period as referred to in Article 1a(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1685/95 of 11 July 1995 on arrangements for issuing export licences for wine sector products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2098/1999(4).
