Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1730/87 laying down quality standards for table grapes(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 888/97(4), has been amended frequently and can no longer ensure legal clarity;\n(2) Regulation (EEC) No 1730/87 should be repealed and the rules it contains recast. To that end in the interest of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard for table grapes recommended by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE);\n(3) applying this standard should result in products of unsatisfactory quality being removed from the market, bringing production into line with consumer requirements and facilitating trade relationships based on fair competition, thereby helping improve the profitability of production;\n(4) the standard applies at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes which the products undergo may cause certain alterations owing to the biological development of the products or their relatively perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages which follow dispatch. Since products in the \"Extra\" class must be sorted and packaged with particular care, only lack of freshness and turgidity is to be taken into account in their case;\n(5) there is a developing demand for small packages containing table grapes of different origins or varieties. This type of presentation should therefore be authorised for table grapes, and the provisions governing marking should be adjusted accordingly;\n(6) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The marketing standard for table grapes falling within CN code 0806 10 10 shall be as set out in the Annex.\nThe standard shall apply at all stages of marketing under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\nHowever, at stages following dispatch, the products may show in relation to the requirements of the standard:\n- a slight lack of freshness and turgidity,\n- for products graded in classes other than the \"Extra\" class, slight deterioration due to their development and their tendency to perish.", "Regulation (EEC) No 1730/87 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the first day of the month following its entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 80.\n(3) OJ L 163, 23.6.1987, p. 25.\n(4) OJ L 126, 17.5.1997, p. 11.\nANNEX\nSTANDARD FOR TABLE GRAPES\nI. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to table grapes of varieties (cultivars) grown from Vitis vinifera L. to be supplied fresh to the consumer, table grapes for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements for table grapes after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, bunches and berries must be:\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n- practically free from pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- free of abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nIn addition, berries must be:\n- intact,\n- well formed,\n- normally developed.\nPigmentation due to sun is not a defect.\nBunches must have been carefully picked.\nThe table grapes must be sufficiently developed and display satisfactory ripeness. The development and condition of the table grapes must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling,\nand\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nThe table grapes are classified into three classes defined below:\ni) \"Extra\" class\nTable grapes in this class must be of superior quality. In shape, development and colouring the bunches must be typical of the variety, allowing for the district in which they are grown, and have no defects. Berries must be firm, firmly attached, evenly spaced along the stalk and have their bloom virtually intact.\nii) Class I\nTable grapes in this class must be of good quality. In shape, development and colouring the bunches must be typical of the variety, allowing for the district in which they are grown. Berries must be firm, firmly attached and, as far as possible, have their bloom intact. They may, however, be less evenly spaced along the stalk than in the \"Extra\" class.\nThe following slight defects, however; may be allowed, provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality, and presentation in the package:\n- slight defects in shape,\n- slight defects in colouring,\n- very slight sun-scorch affecting the skin only.\niii) Class II\nThis class includes table grapes which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes, but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe bunches may show slight defects in shape, development and colouring, provided these do not impair the essential characteristics of the variety, allowing for the district in which they are grown.\nThe berries must be sufficiently firm and sufficiently attached, and, where possible, still have their bloom. They may be less evenly spaced along the stalk than in Class I.\nThe following defects are allowed provided the table grapes retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:\n- defects in shape,\n- defects in colouring,\n- slight sun-scorch affecting the skin only,\n- slight bruising,\n- slight skin defects.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNIG SIZING\nSize is determined by the weight of the bunch.\nThe following minimum size requirements per bunch are defined for table grapes grown under glass and for open-grown table grapes, large-berry or small-berry varieties respectively.\n>TABLE>\nA list of varieties grown under glass and open-grown large-berry and small-berry varieties appears in the Appendix to this standard.\nFor all classes: in each small package not exceeding 1 kg net weight, one bunch below the required minimum weight is allowed to adjust the weight indicated, provided the bunch meet all other requirements for the specified class.\nWhere the name of the variety on the marking does not appear on the list in the Appendix hereto the minimum weight for large-berry varieties is required.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\ni) \"Extra\" class\n5 % by weight of bunches not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those for Class I or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\nii) Class I\n10 % by weight of bunches not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\niii) Class II\n10 % by weight of bunches satisfying neither the requirements of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\ni) \"Extra\" Class and Class I\n10 % by weight of bunches not satisfying the size requirements of the class; but meeting those of the class immediately below.\nii) Class II\n10 % by weight of bunches not satisfying the size requirements of the class but weighing not less than 75 g.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and contain only bunches of the same origin, variety, quality and degree of ripeness.\nFor produce presented in small packages of a net weight not exceeding 1 kg, uniformity of variety and origin is not required.\nIn the case of the \"Extra\" Class, the bunches must be of more or less identical size and colouring.\nThe visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.\nB. Packaging\nThe table grapes must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nIn the case of the \"Extra\" Class, the bunches must be packed in a single layer.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, particularly paper or stamps, bearing trade specifications is allowed provided the printing or labelling has been done with non-toxic ink or glue.\nPackages must be free of all foreign matter, although a fragment of vine shoot no more than 5 cm in length may be left on the stem of the bunch as a form of special presentation.\nVI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package must bear the following particulars in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked, and visible from the outside:\nA. Identification\n- Packer and/or dispatcher: Name and address or officially issued or accepted code mark. However, where a code (symbol) is used, the words \"packer and/or dispatcher\" (or an equivalent abbreviation) must appear close to this code (symbol).\nB. Nature of produce\n- \"Table Grapes\", if the contents are not visible from the outside,\n- name of the variety or, where applicable, varieties.\nC. Origin of produce\n- Country (or, where applicable, countries) of origin and, optionally, district where grown, or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- Class.\nE. Official control mark (optional)\nAppendix\nNON-EXHAUSTIVE LISTS OF VARIETIES(1)\nThe names given in brackets are synonyms that may equally be used on the package.\n1.
