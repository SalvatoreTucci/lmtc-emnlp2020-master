Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0562/2006, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0562/2006 provides for a period of suspension as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their statement concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament's wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the co-decision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time-limit. The European Parliament and the Council also declared that they would make sure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that provide for a time-limit on the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the provision that provides for that period of suspension in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0562/2006 should be deleted.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0562/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) In accordance with Articles\u00a01 and\u00a02 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title\u00a0IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article\u00a05 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(8) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\u00a0(5), which fall within the area referred to in Article\u00a01, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC\u00a0(6) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(9) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article\u00a01, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(1) of Council Decisions 2004/849/EC\u00a0(7) and\u00a02004/860/EC\u00a0(8).\n(10) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29\u00a0May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(9). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(11) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28\u00a0February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(10).
