That prohibition is not to apply to European third countries recognised as being free from Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus (Spieckerman and Kotthoff) Davis et al. (\u2018the organism\u2019).\n(2) It appears from official reports related to survey campaigns in 2009, 2010 and 2011 supplied by Serbia and from information collected during a mission carried out in that country by the Food and Veterinary Office in November and December 2009, that the organism does not occur in Serbia and that that country has applied control, inspection and testing procedures for the organism to imports and domestic production of tubers of Solanum tuberosum L.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to recognise Serbia as being free from the organism.\n(4) This Decision is without prejudice to any subsequent findings that may show that the organism is present in Serbia.\n(5) The Commission will request Serbia to supply, on a yearly basis, the information necessary to verify that Serbia continues to be free from the organism.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Recognition\nSerbia is recognised as being free from Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus (Spieckerman and Kotthoff) Davis et al.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1."}
