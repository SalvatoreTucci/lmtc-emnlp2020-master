Ratu Josefa ILOILO\nPresident of the Republic of the Fiji Islands\nSuva\nFiji\nExcellency,\nThe European Union attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EC partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which form the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, and form the basis of our relations.\nOn 11 December 2006 the Council of the European Union condemned the military takeover in Fiji.\nUnder Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and considering that the military takeover which took place on 5 December 2006 constituted a violation of the essential elements listed in Article 9 of that Agreement, the EU invited Fiji to consultations in order, as provided for in the Agreement, to thoroughly examine the situation and, where necessary, take steps to remedy it.\nThe formal part of those consultations began in Brussels on 18 April 2007. The Interim Government of Fiji made a presentation based on a submission dated 18 April 2007 on the reasons for the military takeover of 5 December 2006, on developments in the country\u2019s situation since the takeover, and on the Interim Government\u2019s programme for the transitional period.\nThe EU took note of the Interim Government\u2019s submission of 18 April 2007 to the EU.\nFor its part, the EU was pleased that the Interim Government confirmed a number of key commitments regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for democratic principles and the rule of law, as noted below, and proposed positive steps regarding their implementation. Fiji also agreed to close cooperation regarding the monitoring and verification of the commitments.\nMost of the commitments made in the context of the consultations will be implemented over an extended period, and it is consequently necessary to monitor and verify their implementation closely over time. The EU underlines that, following the credible general elections held in Fiji as recently as May 2006 and in the light of the findings and recommendations of the EU Election Monitoring Mission, and notably the final report from the EU Chief Observer, MEP Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the EU is of the view that new and credible elections can be held well within the agreed deadline of 28 February 2009.\nThe EU stresses the importance of early and full compliance with the agreed commitments listed in annex.\nThe EU notes that the Interim Government, in accordance with the agreed commitments, had lifted the Public Emergency Regulations on 31 May 2007 and that it accepted the findings and recommendations of the Pacific Islands Forum independent election experts on 19 June 2007.\nThe EU is concerned about the recent lack of progress by the interim Government on process and the substance of the commitments it has agreed to. The interim Government committed to regular dialogue and to giving full information to the EU on all matters linked to its other commitments. On substance, the EU notes in particular that the interim Government has yet to undertake a tribunal pursuant to Section 138(3) of the constitution due by 15 July 2007 and looks forward to a decision as soon as possible.\nIn the spirit of partnership that underlies the Cotonou Agreement and in the light of the positive outcome of the consultations, the EU expressed its readiness to support implementation of Fiji\u2019s commitments. The EU looks forward to regular dialogue meetings being resumed on a regular basis, in accordance with the commitment made by the Interim Government.\nThe EU has adopted the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the revised Cotonou Agreement and Article 37 of the Development Cooperation Instrument:\n\u2014 humanitarian aid as well as direct support to civil society may continue,\n\u2014 cooperation activities under way and/or in preparation, in particular under the 8th and 9th EDFs may continue,\n\u2014 the 9th EDF End-of-term Review may proceed,\n\u2014 cooperation activities, which would help the return to democracy and improve governance, may be pursued, save under very exceptional circumstances,\n\u2014 implementation of the sugar reform accompanying measures for 2006 may proceed. The financing agreement was signed at the technical level by Fiji on 19 June 2007. It is noted that the financing agreement includes a suspension clause,\n\u2014 the Interim Government\u2019s acceptance on 19 June 2007 of the report of 7 June 2007 by the Pacific Islands Forum\u2019s independent election experts is in line with Commitment No 1 agreed on 18 April 2007 between the Interim Government and the EU. Consequently, the preparation and eventual signing of the multi-annual indicative programme for sugar reform accompanying measures for 2008-2010 can proceed,\n\u2014 the finalisation, signing at the technical level and implementation of the Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for the 10th EDF with an indicative financial envelope, as well as the possible allocation of an incentive tranche of up to 25\u00a0% of this sum, will be subject to respect of the commitments made with regard to human rights and the rule of law; notably that the Interim Government upholds the Constitution, that the independence of the judiciary is fully respected and that the Public Emergency Regulations, reintroduced on 6 September 2007, are lifted as soon as possible, that all allegations of human rights infringements are investigated or dealt with in accordance with the various procedures and forums under the laws of the Fiji Islands and that the Interim Government shall use best endeavours to prevent statements by security agencies destined to intimidate,\n\u2014 the 2007 sugar allocation will be zero,\n\u2014 the 2008 sugar allocation will become available, subject to evidence of credible and timely preparation of elections in accordance with the agreed commitments; notably regarding census, redrafting of boundaries and electoral reform in accordance with the Constitution, that measures will be taken to ensure the functioning of the Elections Office, including the appointment by a Supervisor of Elections by 30 September 2007 in accordance with the Constitution,\n\u2014 the 2009 sugar allocation will become available subject to a legitimate government being in place,\n\u2014 the 2010 sugar allocation will depend on progress made in implementing the 2009 sugar allocation and the continuation of the democratic process,\n\u2014 additional support for the preparation and implementation of key commitments, in particular in support of the preparation and/or holding of elections, could be considered over and above what is described in this letter,\n\u2014 regional cooperation, and Fiji\u2019s participation in it, is unaffected,\n\u2014 cooperation with the European Investment Bank and the Centre for the Development of Enterprise may continue subject to the timely fulfilment of commitments made.\nFollow-up of the commitments will be in accordance with the commitments on monitoring in terms of regular dialogue, cooperation with missions and reporting, as referred to in Annex.\nFurthermore, the EU expects Fiji to cooperate fully with the Pacific Islands Forum regarding the implementation of the recommendations by the Eminent Persons\u2019 Group, as endorsed by the Forum Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Vanuatu on 16 March 2007.\nThe European Union will continue to follow the situation in Fiji closely. Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, an enhanced political dialogue will be conducted with Fiji to ensure the respect for human rights, restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law until both parties conclude that the enhanced nature of dialogue has served its purpose.\nIf there is a slowing down, breakdown or reversal in the implementation by the Interim Government of the commitments made, the EU reserves the right to adjust the appropriate measures.\nThe EU stresses that Fiji\u2019s privileges in its cooperation with the EU depend on respect for the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and for the values referred to in the Development Cooperation Instrument. In order to convince the EU that the interim government is fully prepared to follow-up on the commitments given, it is essential that early and substantial progress is made in the fulfilment of the agreed commitments.\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council\nAnnex to the Annex\nAGREED COMMITMENTS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respect for democratic principles\nCommitment No 1\nThat free and fair parliamentary elections take place within 24 months from 1 March 2007 subject to the findings of the assessment to be carried out by the independent auditors appointed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.
