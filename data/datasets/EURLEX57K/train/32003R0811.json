Derogations may be granted in relation to fish after consultation of the appropriate scientific committee.\n(2) The Scientific Steering Committee issued an opinion on 17 September 1999 on the risks arising from recycling animal by-products as feed with regard to propagating TSE in non-ruminant farmed animals. It also issued another opinion on 6 and 7 March 2003 on the feeding of wild fishmeal to farmed fish and recycling of fish with regard to the risk of TSE. The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare adopted an opinion on 26 February 2003 on the use of fish by-products in aquaculture. According to those scientific opinions, the potential risk from recycling fish may be reduced by fulfilling a number of conditions.\n(3) Accordingly, a derogation should be granted from the intra-species recycling ban for fish under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. In order to avoid a risk to public and animal health, that derogation should be subject to certain conditions.\n(4) It is necessary to provide for transitional measures, to allow adequate time for the industry to adjust to the new requirements.\n(5) The Scientific Steering Committee issued an opinion on 16 and 17 January 2003 on the safety vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis TSEs as regards the burial and burning of potentially TSE infected animal materials.\n(6) In order to take account of that opinion it is necessary to lay down implementing measures pursuant to Article 24(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 on how burial and burning of animal by-products should be carried out.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Transitional measures regarding the intra-species recycling ban for fish\nPursuant to Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the Member States may continue to apply until 31 December 2003 at the latest current standards and rules on the feeding of fish without implementing the ban provided for in point (1)(a) of Article 22 of that Regulation with regard to fish.", "Derogation from the intra-species recycling ban for certain fish\n1.
