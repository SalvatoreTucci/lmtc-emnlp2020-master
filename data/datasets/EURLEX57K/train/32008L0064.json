It also provides for certain zones to be recognised as protected zones.\n(2) From information supplied by Member States, it has been determined that only certain plants for planting of Dendranthema (DC.) Des Moul, Dianthus L., Pelargonium l'H\u00e9rit. ex Ait. and Solanaceae present a risk of spreading of Heliothis armigera (H\u00fcbner). Since the risk of spreading of that organism is limited to those plants, that organism should be deleted from Annex I to Directive 2000/29/EC, which imposes a general ban, and included instead in Annex II to that Directive, which imposes a ban only with respect to specific plants presenting a risk. Furthermore, the name of Heliothis armigera (H\u00fcbner) should be changed to Helicoverpa armigera (H\u00fcbner), in line with its recent revised scientific denomination.\n(3) From information supplied by Member States, it has become apparent that Colletotrichum acutatum (Simmonds) is widespread within the Community. Therefore, that organism should no longer be listed as a harmful organism under Directive 2000/29/EC and no further protective measures under that Directive should be taken with respect to that organism. Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) From information supplied by Portugal, it appears that Citrus tristeza virus (European isolates) is now established in Madeira. This part of the Portuguese territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism and Annexes II and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) From information supplied by Spain, it appears that Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Den. and Schiff.) is now established in Ibiza. This part of the Spanish territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism and Annexes II and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) From information supplied by Slovenia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in the Koro\u0161ka and Notranjska regions. These regions should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. and Annexes II, III and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(7) Information supplied by Italy shows that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in some parts of its regions of Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto. Those parts of the Italian territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. and Annexes II, III and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) From the Swiss legislation on plant protection, it appears that the Cantons of Berne and Grisons are no longer recognised as a protected zone for Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. in Switzerland. The derogation allowing certain imports from those regions into certain protected zones under special requirements should therefore be deleted and Part B of Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(9) Annexes I to IV to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I to IV to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 August 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
