With a view to assessing the extent of the overrun in Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, account should be taken of the estimates for the production of table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent using the relevant coefficients referred to, in the case of Greece, in Commission Decision 2001/649/EC\u00a0(3), in the case of Spain, in Commission Decision 2001/650/EC\u00a0(4), in the case of France, in Commission Decision 2001/648/EC\u00a0(5), in the case of Italy, in Commission Decision 2001/658/EC\u00a0(6) and in the case of Portugal, in Commission Decision 2001/670/EC\u00a0(7).\n(2) Article 17a(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that, in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined. That amount must be set at a level that rules out any risk of undue payment to olive growers. The amount also applies to table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent. For the 2002/03 marketing year, the estimated production and the unit amount of the production aid that can be paid in advance were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2003\u00a0(8).\n(3) In order to determine the actual production for which entitlement to aid is recognised, the individual Member States concerned must inform the Commission by no later than 15 May following each marketing year of the quantity on which the aid is payable in that Member State, in accordance with Article 14(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98\u00a0(9). According to that information, the quantity on which the aid is payable for the 2002/03 marketing year is 473\u00a0820 tonnes for Greece, 960\u00a0716 tonnes for Spain, 3\u00a0344 tonnes for France, 686\u00a0342 tonnes for Italy and 28\u00a0771 tonnes for Portugal.\n(4) Confirmation by the Member States that aid is payable on those quantities implies that the controls referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 2261/84 and (EC) No 2366/98 have been carried out. However, setting actual production on the basis of information from the Member States on the quantities on which aid is payable does not prejudge the conclusions that may be drawn from verification of the accuracy of that information under the accounts clearance procedure.\n(5) Taking account of the actual production figures, the unit amount of the production aid provided for in Article 5(1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC payable on the eligible quantities of actual production should also be set.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2002/03 marketing year, the actual production to be used to calculate the aid for olive oil as referred to in Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC shall be:\n\u2014 473\u00a0820 tonnes for Greece,\n\u2014 960\u00a0716 tonnes for Spain,\n\u2014 3\u00a0344 tonnes for France,\n\u2014 686\u00a0342 tonnes for Italy,\n\u2014 28\u00a0771 tonnes for Portugal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2002/03 marketing year, the unit amount of the production aid referred to in Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC payable on the eligible quantities of actual production shall be:\n\u2014 118,35 EUR/100\u00a0kg for Greece,\n\u2014 103,43 EUR/100\u00a0kg for Spain,\n\u2014 130,40 EUR/100\u00a0kg for France,\n\u2014 102,85 EUR/100\u00a0kg for Italy,\n\u2014 130,40 EUR/100\u00a0kg for Portugal.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.
