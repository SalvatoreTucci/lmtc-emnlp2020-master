In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.\n(2) In accordance with Article 9(1)(c) of Directive 91/496/EEC, health guarantees must be laid down for the transport of animals from one third country to another. Certain problems have been encountered as regards movements of equidae from one third country to another.\n(3) Commission Decision 92/260/EEC\u00a0(4) lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification required for temporary admission of registered horses. Those conditions provide all the necessary guarantees as regards the Community's health status. For the health guarantees applicable to movements of equidae from one third country to another, reference should therefore be made to the health conditions laid down in Decision 92/260/EEC. That Decision requires, among others, a certain residence in the country of dispatch. The residence in Member States or certain listed third countries may, however, count for the calculation of the period considered, provided that at least the same health requirements are fulfilled.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equidae on their way from one third country to another must come from a third country listed in Annex I to Decision 92/260/EEC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equidae as referred to in paragraph 1 must be accompanied by a certificate entitled \u2018Transit certificate for the transport of equidae from one third country to another\u2019.
