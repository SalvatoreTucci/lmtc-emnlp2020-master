Therefore, provisions should be adopted for the release and the forfeiting of the security lodged in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(8) On the basis of the tenders received a maximum export refund may be fixed. However, situations may arise on the market in which economic or other aspects urge that none of the tenders received be accepted.\n(9) Experience has shown that provisions need to be laid down to deter inaccurate documents from being presented. A suitable sanctions system should therefore be established and the cases where no sanctions are to be applied should be determined.\n(10) Commission Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(6) and EC No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(7) should apply to the export refunds provided for in this Regulation.\n(11) As a consequence of the adoption of common rules, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice\u00a0(8) and, (EC) No 580/2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products\u00a0(9) should be repealed.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nScope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down common rules for the organisation and management of tendering procedures for fixing the amount of the export refunds for the products of the following sectors:\n(a) milk and milk products;\n(b) cereals;\n(c) rice;\n(d) sugar.\nIt shall apply without prejudice to the derogations and specific provisions laid down in Commission Regulations opening a tendering procedure concerning export refunds specific to the agricultural products mentioned in the first subparagraph.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of application of this Regulation \u2018the competent authorities of the Member States\u2019 are the departments or bodies accredited by the Member States as paying agencies which fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005\u00a0(10).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1291/2000 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "Opening of the Tendering Procedure\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each product concerned the tendering procedure shall be opened by Commission Regulation, hereinafter referred to as \u2018Regulation opening the tendering procedure\u2019, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 42(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 and the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation of the markets in the agricultural products concerned.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Regulation opening the tendering procedure shall contain the following information:\n(a) the products covered by the tendering procedure with their relevant CN codes;\n(b) the period covered by the tender (tendering period) and the different sub-periods when the tenders can be lodged;\n(c) the opening and closing time between which tenders may be lodged;\n(d) the global quantity covered by the tendering procedure, if necessary;\n(e) the minimum quantity each tender must provide for;\n(f) the amount of the security;\n(g) the destination to which products have to be exported, if required;\n(h) the competent authority of Member States to which tenders are to be sent.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The information required in points (b), (d) and (h) of paragraph 2, may be published in the Official Journal of the European Union by a notice of invitation to tender.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At least six days must elapse between the entry into force of the Regulation opening the tendering procedure or the publication of the notice of invitation to tender and the first date for the submission of tenders.", "Submission of tenders and application for export licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be lodged by operators established and registered for VAT purposes in the Community to the competent authorities of the Member States indicated either in the Regulation opening the tendering procedure or in the notice of invitation to tender.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be lodged in conjunction with and using the application form for an export licence as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders may be lodged by electronic means, using the method made available to the operators by the Member State concerned.
