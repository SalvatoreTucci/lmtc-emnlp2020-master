Therefore Commission Decisions 2008/232/EC\u00a0(2) and 2011/229/EU\u00a0(3) adopted under Directive 2008/57/EC set maximum levels of noise for new high-speed and conventional rolling stock.\n(2) Point 1.4.4 of Annex III of Directive 2008/57/EC provides that operation of the rail system must respect existing regulations on noise pollution. This essential requirement is necessary to specify the basic noise parameters as set out in points 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of the Annex to Decision 2011/229/EU and in points 4.2.6.5.2, 4.2.6.5.3, 4.2.6.5.4 and 4.2.7.6 of the Annex to Decision 2008/232/EC.\n(3) Point 1.4.4 of Annex III to Directive 2008/57/EC refers to existing regulations which are not further specified. Therefore, in order to avoid ambiguity and stipulate the intended general objective of this Directive in relation to noise, that point should be amended.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["Point 1.4.4 of Annex III to Directive 2008/57/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.4.4.
