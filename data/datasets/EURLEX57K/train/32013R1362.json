Only an unopened original package is to be sampled. The sample may be packaged in a box or vacuum-packaged in plastic.\nIn the case of frozen uncooked meat the sample is to be thawed (for example in a refrigerator at a low temperature of 4\u00a0\u00b0C). The discharge of fluid is to be to be limited to a minimum.\nRelevant information about the packaging and/or about the samples is to be registered or photographed and included in the test report referred to in point 4.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrying out of the visual examination\nThe sample is to be visually examined after removal of the packaging.\nThe sample is to be examined by at least two assessors.\nWhen carrying out the visual examination, the assessors must take account of the following factors:\n(a) not each part of the surface of the sample needs to be seasoned up to the same degree;\n(b) absence of seasoning on creases or folds of the loosened inner fillet is unimportant for determining whether or not the seasoning has been applied over the whole surface;\n(c) observation of white pepper is more difficult than that of black pepper;\n(d) observation of pepper on a surface of lightly coloured meat (for example, breast meat) is easier than the observation of pepper on a surface of dark coloured meat (for example, thigh bone meat).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evaluation of results\nAll the assessors must come to the same conclusion on whether or not the sample has been seasoned over the whole surface and whether or not the seasoning is visible to the naked eye.\nThey must fill in the test report on the visual examination of uncooked seasoned poultry meat. The specimen of the test report form is set out in Appendix 1.\nWhere all the assessors do not arrive at the same conclusion with regard to a certain sample, or where they all arrive at the conclusion that the sample has not been seasoned over the whole surface or that the seasoning is not visible to the naked eye, the sample must be tested in accordance with Part II.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explanatory pictures\nThe enclosed pictures show how samples are to be assessed during the visual examination.\nThe pictures are of peppered poultry meat but the explanations given below each picture may also apply to other spices.\nIn the pictures \u2018TOP\u2019 refers to the outer surface of the poultry breast and \u2018UNDERSIDE\u2019 refers to the surface of the poultry breast exposed when cut from the bone.\nPicture 1A\nPicture 1B\nPicture 2A\nPicture 2B\nPicture 3A\nPicture 3B\nPicture 4A\nPicture 4B\nPicture 5A\nPicture 5B\nPicture 6\nPicture 7\nPicture 8\nPicture 9\nPicture 10\nPicture 11\nPicture 12\nPicture 13\nPART II:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TASTING OF SEASONED POULTRY MEAT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objective and definition\nThe objective of this method is to determine whether uncooked seasoned poultry meat has to be classified in Chapter 2 or in Chapter 16 of the Combined Nomenclature because it can be established that:\n(1) the poultry meat has been seasoned in depth or over the whole surface and\n(2) the seasoning is clearly distinguishable by taste.\nThe method consists of tasting one or more samples of poultry meat after cooking.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equipment of the testing premises\nThe premises in which the tasting is carried out must have the following minimum equipment:\n\u2014 a microwave oven,\n\u2014 chopping boards,\n\u2014 sharp knives,\n\u2014 plain plates (e.g. polystyrene or crockery) labelled with random 3-digit codes,\n\u2014 forks for serving,\n\u2014 probe (food thermometer),\n\u2014 disposable gloves.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of samples\nA sample must consist of a representative portion of the poultry meat destined for consumption.\nIf there is any doubt about a sample, for example in respect of the addition of atypical compound(s) or possible microbial contamination, a risk assessment or a pre-test microbiological analysis must be carried out.\nThe sample is to be fully cooked in a microwave. When tested, the sample must be suitable for human consumption.\nThe sample must reach an internal temperature of at least 77\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature is checked using a probe (food thermometer) at the end of the cooking time. If the specifications of the microwave request a \u2018standing time\u2019, the temperature is taken when the standing time has ended. Standing time allows for additional cooking after the power is turned off, with the heat already generated, while the door of the microwave is closed.\nThe outer surface of the sample is to be removed using a sharp knife to expose the cooked flesh in the centre. Care is to be taken not to contaminate the central part of the flesh with the outer surface.\nThe central part of the flesh is to be cut in about 2\u00a0cm3 portions.\nThe samples are to be left to cool for at least 10 minutes.\nThe samples are to be served to the assessors on labelled plates.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrying out of the tasting\nBetween five and eight qualified and trained assessors are presented with one or more samples. No more than five samples may be assessed in one session.\nSufficient time and/or a suitable palate cleanser (bottled water and unsalted crackers) must be provided between sample servings.\nThe assessors must be able to conduct the assessment with minimal distraction.\nThe assessors must taste the sample and objectively describe the key flavour, aftertaste and mouthfeel attributes of the sample.\nThe assessors must fill in the following two forms:\n(a) Attribute Generation Form for Customs Testing of Poultry Products.\n(b) Free Description Collation Form for Customs Testing of Poultry Products.\nSpecimens of the forms are set out in Appendices 2 and 3.\nEach assessor individually writes down on the Attribute Generation Form the characteristics indicating on a scale from 1 to 3 the intensity of each characteristic by using only the terms \u2018SLIGHT\u2019 (1), \u2018CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE\u2019 (2) and \u2018STRONG\u2019 (3).\nThe key descriptive terms used by the assessors are recorded in the Free Description Collation Form, indicating the number of assessors using each term for each sample.\nThe intensity or strength of the characteristic is also summarised on the Free Description Collation Form.\nWhere different assessors use different terms that are known to carry a similar meaning, such as \u2018fatty\u2019 and \u2018greasy\u2019, they shall be considered to have used the same terms.\nThe results for added flavours or spices (for example, \u2018sour\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018hot\u2019, \u2018spicy\u2019, \u2018pepper\u2019, \u2018garlic\u2019 etc.) are to be filled in on the Free Description Collation Form.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evaluation of results\nWhere in the Attribute Generation Form and the Free Description Collation Form at least half of the assessors indicated that they tasted added flavours or spices reaching at least scale 2 (\u2018CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE\u2019) pursuant to point 4, the seasoning of the sample is considered to be clearly distinguishable by taste.\nThe forms must give the full details of the samples, their preparation, as well as the procedure(s) followed to reach and interpret the obtained results.\nAppendix 1\nTest report on the visual examination of uncooked seasoned poultry meat\nDate: \u2026\nCode \u2026 Code \u2026 Code \u2026 Code \u2026 Code \u2026\nSeasoning over the whole surface of the product YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO\nSeasoning visible to the naked eye YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO YES / NO\nRelevant information\nAppendix 2\nAttribute generation form for customs testing of poultry products\nName: \u2026 Date: \u2026 Product: \u2026\nCode Flavour / Aftertaste / Mouthfeel Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n1 2 3\nSLIGHT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE STRONG\nAppendix 3\nFree description collation form for customs testing of poultry products\nDate: \u2026\nCode 1 2 3 Code 1 2 3 Code 1 2 3\nAttributes mentioned for:  Slight Clearly distinguishable Strong  Slight Clearly distinguishable Strong  Slight Clearly distinguishable Strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiled by: \u2026 Checked by: \u2026\nIn columns 1, 2, and 3 please enter the number of assessors who identified that attribute."}
