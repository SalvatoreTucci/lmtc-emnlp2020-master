This situation has already led to high prices locally, causing supply difficulties at competitive prices for growers and the livestock feed industry alike.\n(3) Slovakia has significant intervention stocks of maize, which should be used up.\n(4) The stocks of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency should therefore be made available on the Spanish cereals market; given the need to supply growers in the south of Spain, those stocks are particularly suited to the traders\u2019 needs.\n(5) To ensure the best supply conditions for these regions, the maize must be delivered to the ports of Huelva, Seville or C\u00e1diz.\n(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(7) It is also important that the Slovak intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(8) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(9) In order to prevent disturbances on the Spanish market, in particular during marketing of the new year\u2019s maize harvest, these cereals should be delivered before 30 September 2005.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Slovak intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 100\u00a0000 tonnes of rye held by it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These sales are intended to supply the Spanish market.
