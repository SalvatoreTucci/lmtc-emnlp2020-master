Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 13 and 26 September 2007.\n(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is therefore appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available on the internal market.\n(4) To allow comparison of tender prices for sugar of different qualities, the tender price should refer to sugar of the standard quality as defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.\n(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(7) The minimum selling price refers to sugar of the standard quality. Provision should be made to adjust the selling price.\n(8) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(9) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States on the quantities actually sold.\n(10) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001\u00a0(4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation [are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar],", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender on the Community internal market a maximum total quantity of 601\u00a0981 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale on the internal market.\nThe maximum quantities involved per Member State are set out in Annex I.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 1 October 2007 and shall end on 10 October 2007 at 15.00, Brussels time.\nThe periods during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second and subsequent partial invitations shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding period.
