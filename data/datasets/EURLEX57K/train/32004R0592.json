To be included on that list, a third country must demonstrate its rabies status and that it complies with certain conditions relating to notification, monitoring, veterinary services, prevention and control of rabies and regulation of vaccines.\n(3) In order to avoid any unnecessary disturbance in the movements of pet animals, and to allow time for the third countries to provide additional guarantees, where necessary, it is appropriate to establish a provisional list of third countries. That list should be based on the data available through the International Office of Epizootie Diseases (OIE-World Organisation for Animal Health), the results of inspections carried out by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office in the third countries concerned and information gathered by Member States.\n(4) The provisional list of third countries should include countries which are free of rabies and countries in respect of which the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements from their territories has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly. In the interests of clarity the list of countries and territories set out in that Regulation should be replaced in its entirety.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 3 July 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX II\nLIST OF COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES\nPART A\nIE Ireland\nSE Sweden\nUK United Kingdom\nPART B\nSection 1\n(a) DK Denmark, including GL - Greenland and FO - Faroe Islands\n(b) ES Spain, including the continental territory, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands, and excluding Ceuta-Melilla;\n(c) FR France, including GF- French Guiana, GP - Guadeloupe, MQ - Martinique and RE - R\u0102\u0160union;\n(d) GI Gibraltar;\n(e) PT Portugal, including the continental territory, Azores and Madeira;\n(f) Member States other than those listed in Part A and points (a), (b) (c) and (e) of this section.\nSection 2\nAD Andorra\nCH Switzerland\nIS Iceland\nLI Liechtenstein\nMC Monaco\nNO Norway\nSM San Marino\nVA Vatican City State\nPART C\nAC Ascension Island\nAG Antigua and Barbuda\nAN Netherlands Antilles\nAU Australia\nAW Aruba\nBB Barbados\nBH Bahrain\nBM Bermuda\nCA Canada\nFJ Fiji\nFK Falkland Isalnds\nHR Croatia\nJM Jamaica\nJP Japan\nKN Saint Kitts and Nevis\nKY Cayman Islands\nMS Montserrat\nMU Mauritius\nNC New Caledonia\nNZ New Zealand\nPF French Polynesia\nPM Saint Pierre et Miquelon\nSG Singapore\nSH Saint Helena\nUS United States of America\nVC Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nVU Vanuatu\nWF Wallis and Futuna\nYT Mayotte\"."}
