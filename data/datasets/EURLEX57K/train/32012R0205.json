In accordance with Annex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011, data collected by a Member State to monitor the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with Articles 4 and 11 of that Regulation are to be consistent with a certificate of conformity and based on this document only.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community\u2019s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles\u00a0(3) requires the Member States to use the certificate of conformity as a data source but allows for the use of other documents providing equivalent accuracy for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from passenger cars. In order to ensure cost-efficient and accurate monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions data for light commercial vehicles, it is appropriate in the short-term to allow Member States to use the same procedure and data sources for the monitoring and reporting under Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011 as those used for reporting under Regulation (EC) No\u00a0443/2009. Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011 should, where duly justified, allow for the use of other data sources providing equivalent accuracy for CO2 monitoring and reporting purposes. The Member States should put the necessary measures in place to ensure adequate accuracy in the monitoring procedure.\n(3) Based on the experience gained from the monitoring of CO2 emissions from passenger cars, it is appropriate, in order to improve the means for verifying the accuracy of the data, to add type-approval number as a detailed data parameter to be reported by Member States. It has also become evident that there is no need for the parameter \u2018commercial name\u2019 which therefore should be deleted from the detailed monitoring data.\n(4) In order to ensure clarity and precision in the monitoring and reporting by Member States, it is also necessary to ensure consistency between the different requirements specified in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011. The detailed data requirements are specified in the reporting formats set out in Part C of Annex II. Parts A and B of that Annex should therefore be adjusted to reflect those detailed data requirements accurately.\n(5) Annex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0510/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Part A is amended as follows:\n(a) \u2018The details referred to in point 1 shall be taken from the certificate of conformity or be consistent with the certificate of conformity issued by the manufacturer of the relevant light commercial vehicle.
