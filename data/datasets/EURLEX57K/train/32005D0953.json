Accordingly, the European Community notified the WTO on 2 July 2003 of its intention to modify certain concessions in EC Schedule CXL.\n(2) Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by Article 133 of the Treaty and within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council.\n(3) The Commission has negotiated with the United States of America, having a principal supplying interest in products of HS code 1006\u00a020 (husked rice) and substantial supplier interest in products of HS code 1006\u00a030 (milled rice), Thailand, having a principal supplying interest in products of HS code 1006\u00a030 (milled rice) and substantial supplier interest in products of HS code 1006\u00a020 (husked rice) and India and Pakistan, each having a substantial supplier interest in products of HS code 1006\u00a020 (husked rice).\n(4) The agreements with India and with Pakistan have been approved on behalf of the Community by Decisions 2004/617/EC\u00a0(1) and 2004/618/EC\u00a0(2) respectively. A new tariff rate for husked rice (CN code 1006\u00a020) and milled rice (CN code 1006\u00a030) was fixed by Decision 2004/619/EC\u00a0(3).

The EC shall apply a rate of duty for semi-milled and milled rice (HS subheading 1006\u00a030) in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6.\n3. The Annual Reference Import Level shall be calculated as the average volume of total semi-milled and milled rice imports entering the EC-25 from all origins in the marketing years (from 1 September to 31 August) 2001/02 to 2003/04 plus 10\u00a0% (i.e. 337\u00a0168 tonnes).\n4. Six-Month Reference Import Level: in each marketing year, a six-month reference import level shall be calculated as 47\u00a0% of the annual reference import level calculated in paragraph 3 (i.e. 158\u00a0469 tonnes).\n5. Mid-Year Adjustment to Applied Tariff Rate: within 10 days after the end of the first six months of each marketing year, the EC shall review and, if necessary, adjust the applied tariff rate as follows:\n(a) if actual semi-milled and milled rice imports for the just-completed six-month period are more than 15\u00a0% above the six-month reference import level for that period, as calculated under paragraph 4 above (i.e. more than 182\u00a0239 tonnes), the EC shall apply a tariff rate of EUR 175/t;\n(b) if actual semi-milled and milled rice imports for the just-completed six-month period are less than or equal to the six-month reference import level for that period, as calculated under paragraph 4 above, increased by 15\u00a0% (i.e. less than or equal to 182\u00a0239 tonnes), the EC shall apply a tariff rate of EUR 145/t.\n6. End-of-Year Adjustment to Applied Tariff Rate: within 10 days after the end of the marketing year, the EC shall review and, if necessary, adjust the applied tariff rate as follows:\n(a) if actual semi-milled and milled rice imports for the just-completed marketing year are more than 15\u00a0% above the annual reference import level for that 12-month period, as calculated under paragraph 3 above (i.e. more than 387\u00a0743 tonnes), the EC shall apply a tariff rate of EUR 175/t;\n(b) if actual semi-milled and milled rice imports for the just-completed marketing year are less than or equal to the annual reference import level for that 12-month period, as calculated under paragraph 3 above, increased by 15\u00a0% (i.e. less than or equal to 387\u00a0743 tonnes), the EC shall apply a tariff rate of EUR 145/t.\n7.

Broken rice: for rice with HS subheading 1006\u00a040, the EC shall apply an import duty of EUR 65/t.\n9. The volume of the current TRQ of broken rice shall be increased to 100\u00a0000 tonnes.

Data: the calculation of the annual and six-month actual import levels under paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be determined using EC rice imports license data. The EC shall publish these data on the Internet on a weekly basis.\n11. Transparency: the EC shall promptly provide public notice of any adjustment in the applied tariff rate.\n12.
