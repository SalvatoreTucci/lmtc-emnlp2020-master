Future amendments to that Regulation will fine tune those rules, also on the basis of the data which will become available inside the European Aviation Safety Agency (hereinafter \u2018the Agency\u2019) following the implementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning system.\n(2) Agreements referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 should provide a basis for the evaluation of the actual workload involved in the certification of third countries\u2019 products. In principle, the process for validation by the Agency of certificates issued by a third country with which the Community has an appropriate agreement is described in these agreements and should result in a different workload from the process required for certification activities by the Agency.\n(3) While ensuring the balance between overall expenditure incurred by the Agency in carrying out certification tasks and overall income from the fees and charges it levies, the rules for calculating the fees and charges have to remain effective and fair towards all applicants. This must be true also for the calculation of travel costs outside the territory of the Member States. The present formula has to be refined to make sure that it refers exclusively to the direct costs incurred for those travels.\n(4) The experience gained from the application of Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 has shown that it is necessary to specify when the Agency may invoice the fee due and to set up the method to calculate the amount to be refunded in case a certification task is interrupted. Similar rules have to be provided in case a certificate is surrendered or suspended.\n(5) For technical reasons, changes should be introduced in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 in order to enhance some definitions or classifications.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 593/2007 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 6 is replaced by the following:\nd = fee due\nf = fee corresponding to the task carried out, as set out in the Annex\nv = travel costs\nh = time spent by experts in the means of transport, invoiced at the hourly fee set out in Part II\ne = average travel costs inside the territories of the Member States, including the average time spent in the means of transport inside the territories of the Member States multiplied by the hourly fee set out in Part II.\u2019\n2.
