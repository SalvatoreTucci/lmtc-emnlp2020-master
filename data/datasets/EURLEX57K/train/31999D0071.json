The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 194/1999 imposing definitive duties (4).\n(3) Based on the definitive findings of the investigation, it was concluded that the injury suffered by the Community industry was not caused by imports of hardboard originating in Brazil, that the proceeding should be terminated without the adoption of protective measures with regard to this country and that the undertakings provisionally accepted from the exporting producers in Brazil should lapse according to Article 8(6) of the Basic Regulation.\n(4) The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to imports originating in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia.\n(5) The Commission considers that the price undertakings offered by the exporting producers and provisionally accepted in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1742/98 are an effective measure to remove the injury caused by the dumped imports, since their prices are such as to eliminate the injurious effect of the dumping, they only cover imports of a reduced number of product types and only up to a certain quantity threshold. Indeed, without these three conditions effective monitoring would not be practicable and companies would be encouraged to circumvent the undertaking by declaring as covered by the undertaking product types outside its scope.\n(6) In accordance with the provisions of the undertakings, the minimum prices contained therein have been amended in line with the definitive findings of the investigation.\n(7) Having been informed of the main facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to accept the undertakings, the Community industry did not raise any objections to the acceptance of the proposed undertakings.\n(8) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking a definitive anti-dumping duty may be imposed, pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the Basic Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
