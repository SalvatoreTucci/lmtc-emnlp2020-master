BORCHERT\n(1) OJ No C 305, 31. 10. 1994.\n(2) OJ No L 9, 13. 1. 1988, p. 12.\nANNEX\nThe applications of remote sensing to agricultural statistics to be implemented or developed during 1994 to 1998 are organized into the following groups:\nOperational activities\n- Activity A: regional inventories,\n- Activity B: European rapid estimates.\nActivities for development\n- Activity C: integrated system,\n- Activity D: monitoring and prediction of harvest outside the Community,\n- Activity E: application of new methods or sensors.\nI. Operational activities\nActivity A: regional inventories\nAt the end of the first phase of the pilot project, responsibility for the implementation of the regional inventories was mainly transferred to the Member States. This activity is currently carried out in the southern Member States and occasionally in  the northern ones. The Member States are responsible for its continued application, extension and financing.\nHowever, it is desirable in certain circumstances for technical assistance and its financing to be financed from the Community budget. This mainly comprises assistance for statistical techniques and, more particularly, statification, certain pilot  studies of limited scope and the improvement of software.\nActivity B: European rapid estimates\nThis activity is the continuation of Action 4 of the first phase of the pilot project in its operational stage. The objective is no longer to develop a method but to apply it at Community level for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (CAP).\nSince the results were satisfactory overall at the end of phase 1, only minor adjustments to the method are needed. However, the following developments could be considered:\n- extending the method to the new Member States,\n- improving the representativeness of the sites selected at Community level and for certain Member States,\n- improving methods for monitoring trends in set-aside areas,\n- introducing analysis of radar images with a view to achieving greater security and reliability over time.\nII. Activities for development\nActivity C: integrated system\nThis concerns the transaction of Actions 2 and 3 of phase 1 to the operational stage, particularly their integration at the level of the Community and the Member States.\nActivity C-1: transition of Action 2 to the operational stage. This involves the validation of the vegetation and surface temperature indices obtained at the end of the first phase. It also concerns a statistical model for selecting representative areas  for the various crop types for targeted indices. Transition to the operational stage also involves improvements in the production chain in terms of lead time and data reliability.\nActivity C-2: transition of the various components of Action 3 to the operational stage, an improved Eurostat Agromet model, an agrometeorological model for yield prediction and forecasting using the pollen method.\nAs in the case of Activity C-1, these different models must be valiated and the processing chains made more reliable to meet the needs of the operational stage.\nActivity C-3: advanced agricultural information system at Community level. This activity will involve cross checking the information obtained from Activities C-1, C-2 and B. Activity B should be accurate for acreage but is likely to be less so for  yields. Conversely, Activities C-1 and C-2 provide essential information regarding yields. Integration and checking of the results of several actions should help optimize the whole system.\nActivity C-4: examining the possibility of applying Activity C-3 at regional or national level. However, the acreage component provided by Activity B currently exists only at Community level and the quality of the yield predictions suffers when the area  studied is smaller. Activity C-4 is intended to overcome these difficulties in close collaboration with the Member States.\nActivity D: monitoring and prediction of harvests outside the Community\nThe validation of Action 4 at Community level and the implementation of Actions 2 and 3 mean that it is now possible to envisage the monitoring and prediction of harvests outside the Community.\nThe purpose of Activity D is to develop a method by working on eastern Europe and possibly the Maghreb region. The countries in these two areas represent considerable export potential for the Community and sometimes also considerable import potential.  In both cases, the Community is engaged in active cooperation policies.\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of this activity, the Commission will seek the necessary cooperation in connection with programmes having similar objectives, such as the Phare MARS programme. However, under this project the Commission's  requirements will take priority.\nActivity E: application of new methods of sensors\nThe first phase of the plan provided only for the use of the Landsat-TM, SPOT and NOAA-AVHRR sensors (high-resolution or meterological satellites) for the principal actions. The activities planned for the next five years will probably continue to be  based on this type of sensor. However, information from other types of sensors, particularly radar, should be used whenever useful. Work carried out in this field to date shows that radar images can be used in the project. However, it remains necessary  to test the feasibility and usefulness of this source of information on wider areas than those studied to date.\nData from the Meteostat satellite should also be integrated, so as to improve knowledge of certain agrometeorological parameters.\nLastly, in the context of Activity D, work already commenced in the field of processing and classification of data from satellite images from the past 10 years should be continued. The volume of data concerned is very large and ways of computerizing the  task should therefore be studied."}
