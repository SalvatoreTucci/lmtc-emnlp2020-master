This quota must be opened and administered by the Commission.\n(2) It is necessary to keep an administration system which ensures that only products originating in Thailand may be imported under the quota. The issue of an import licence should therefore continue to be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the Thai authorities, based on the model notified to the Commission by Thailand.\n(3) Since imports to the Community market of the products concerned have traditionally been administered on the basis of a calendar year, this system should be retained. A quota must therefore be opened for 2007.\n(4) The import of products covered by CN codes 0714\u00a010\u00a010, 0714\u00a010\u00a091 and 0714\u00a010\u00a099 is subject to the presentation of an import licence in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(2), and with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice\u00a0(3).\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(4) applies to import licences for tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed rules for applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It limits the period of validity of import licences to the final day of the tariff quota period and applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down by the sectoral regulations.\n(6) In the light of past experience and taking into account that the Community concession provides for an overall quantity of 21\u00a0000\u00a0000 tonnes over four years with an annual maximum of 5\u00a0500\u00a0000 tonnes, it is advisable to maintain measures which, under certain conditions, either facilitate the release for free circulation of quantities of products exceeding those given in the import licences, or allow the difference between the figure given in the import licences and the smaller figure actually imported to be carried forward.\n(7) In order to ensure the correct application of the agreement, a system of strict and systematic controls is needed that take account of the information given on the Thai export certificates and the Thai authorities\u2019 procedures for issuing export certificates.\n(8) Where the quantities requested exceed the quantities available, a mechanism should be provided for reducing the quantities in order not to exceed the annual maximum laid down.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nOPENING OF THE QUOTA", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An import tariff quota for 5\u00a0500\u00a0000 tonnes of manioc falling within CN codes 0714\u00a010\u00a010, 0714\u00a010\u00a091 and 0714\u00a010\u00a099 originating in Thailand is hereby opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 2007.\nThe customs duty applicable is hereby fixed at 6\u00a0% ad valorem.\nThe serial number of the quota shall be 09.4008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The products referred to in paragraph 1 shall benefit from the arrangements provided for in this Regulation on condition that they are imported under import licences issued subject to the submission of a certificate for export to the European Community issued by the Department of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Commerce, Government of Thailand, hereinafter referred to as an \u2018export certificate\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000, 1342/2003 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nEXPORT CERTIFICATES", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There shall be one original and at least one copy of the export certificate, to be made out on a form of which a specimen is given in Annex I.\nThe size of the form shall be approximately 210\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0297 millimetres.
