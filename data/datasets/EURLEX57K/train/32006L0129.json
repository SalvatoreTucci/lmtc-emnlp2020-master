Those errors need to be corrected. In addition it is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In particular where appropriate, the specific purity criteria have been adapted to reflect the limits for individual heavy metals of interest. For reasons of clarity the whole text concerning those substances should be replaced.\n(4) The level of sulphated ash in the purity criteria for E 472c citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids should be amended in order to cover partially or wholly neutralised products.\n(5) It is necessary to ensure that E 559 aluminium silicate is produced from raw kaolinitic clay which is free from unacceptable dioxin contamination. The presence of dioxin in the raw kaolinitic clay should therefore be restricted to the lowest possible level.\n(6) It is necessary to adopt specifications for the new food additives authorised through Directive 2006/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners and Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs: E 319 tertiary-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), E 426 soybean hemicellulose, E 462 ethyl cellulose, E 586 4-hexylresorcinol, E 1204 pullulan and E 1452 starch aluminium octenyl succinate.\n(7) Directive 96/77/EC should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 96/77/EC is amended and corrected in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 February 2008 at the latest.
