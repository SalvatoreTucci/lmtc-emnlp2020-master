Council Decision 2001/923/EC\u00a0(8) gave the Commission responsibility for managing and implementing a Community exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the Pericles programme) in cooperation with the Member States.\n(8) Given these new dimensions in Community legislation and the committee\u2019s horizontal function, the committee\u2019s advisory powers should be adapted, as should the representation on it of the Member States, whose representatives must be able to be assisted by the competent national authorities. In the interests of flexibility there should also be provision for the possibility of setting up sectoral working parties.\n(9) Decision 94/140/EC must be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 94/140/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
