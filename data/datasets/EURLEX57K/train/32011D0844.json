Those areas are listed in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC. That Decision is to apply until 31 December 2011.\n(2) Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 have last occurred in poultry in the Union in Romania in March 2010 and the virus has been detected in a wild bird in Bulgaria in April 2010. According to available information, there are currently no outbreaks of that disease in the Union. It is therefore appropriate to remove Romania from the list set out in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC.\n(3) The measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC have proven to be very effective and the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the zones that the competent authority has placed under restrictions has increased transparency and trust of non-affected Member States and third countries in the measures taken.\n(4) In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 is still present in several third countries and continues therefore to pose a threat to animal and human health in the Union. The period of application of Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be extended.\n(5) In September 2011 an external evaluation of the Union\u2019s emergency response network has started. The evaluation aims at assessing the effectiveness of the network. That evaluation is to be completed by August 2012. The results of the evaluation will be taken into account in a possible review of the measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC.\n(6) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/415/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 12, the date \u201831 December 2011\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2013\u2019;\n2. in the Annex, the entries for Romania are deleted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 10, 14.1.2006, p. 16.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 164, 16.6.2006, p. 51."}
