The maximum amount of the B levy for 2005/06 should therefore be raised to 37,5\u00a0% of the intervention price for the white sugar concerned.\n(4) Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 fixes the minimum price for B beet at EUR 32,42 per tonne, subject to Article 15(5) of that Regulation, which provides for the corresponding adjustment of the price for B beet in the event of adjustment of the maximum amount of the B levy.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["For the 2005/06 marketing year, the maximum amount of the B levy referred to in the first indent of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall be increased to 37,5\u00a0% of the intervention price for white sugar.", "For the 2005/06 marketing year, the minimum price for B beet referred to in Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall be fixed, in accordance with Article 15(5) of that Regulation, at EUR\u00a028,84 per tonne.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.
