It concerns the possible migration of lead and cadmium from ceramic articles which, in their finished state, are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, or which are in contact with foodstuffs, and are intended for that purpose.\n(2) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 provides that the specific measures are to require that materials and articles covered by those measures are accompanied by a written declaration stating that they comply with the rules applicable to them.\n(3) That requirement has not yet been set out in Directive 84/500/EEC. There is a need to lay down that obligation for all ceramic articles which are not yet in contact with foodstuffs to clearly distinguish them from decorative articles.\n(4) The national competent authorities should have access to documents demonstrating that the ceramic articles comply with the migration limits for lead and cadmium. Therefore, the manufacturer or importer into the Community should make information concerning analysis carried out available to them on request.\n(5) Directive 84/500/EEC lays down a method for the analysis of lead and cadmium. Technological progress has been made in that area and the analytical method set out in that Directive is only one amongst several possible methods. This Directive should take technological progress into account and establish a set of performance criteria that the analytical method must comply with having regard to Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 laying down the sampling methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs\u00a0(3).\n(6) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of ensuring the free movement of ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs to lay down rules for a correct enforcement of Directive 84/500/EEC. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.\n(7) Directive 84/500/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 84/500/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.

The limit of quantification for lead and cadmium must be equal to or lower than:\n\u2014 0,2 mg/litre for lead,\n\u2014 0,02 mg/litre for cadmium.\n4.3. Recovery. The recovery of lead and cadmium added to the 4\u00a0% acetic acid solution, as referred to in point 3.1, must lie within 80-120\u00a0% of the added amount.\n4.4. Specificity. The instrumental method of analysis used must be free from matrix and spectral interferences.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of the sample\nThe sample must be clean and free from grease or other matter likely to affect the test.\nWash the sample in a solution containing a household liquid detergent at a temperature of approximately 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Rinse the sample first in tap-water and then in distilled water or water of equivalent quality. Drain and dry so as to avoid any stain. The surface to be tested is not to be handled after it has been cleaned.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of lead and/or cadmium\n\u2014 The sample thus prepared is tested under the conditions laid down in Annex I.\n\u2014 Before taking the test solution for determining lead and/or cadmium, homogenise the content of the sample by an appropriate method, which avoids any loss of solution or abrasion of the surface being tested.\n\u2014 Carry out a blank test on the reagent used for each series of determinations.\n\u2014 Carry out determinations for lead and/or cadmium under appropriate conditions.\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX III\nDECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE\nThe written declaration referred to in Article 2a(1) shall contain the following information:\n1. the identity and address of the company which manufactures the finished ceramic article and of the importer who imports it into the Community;\n2. the identity of the ceramic article;\n3. the date of the declaration;\n4. the confirmation that the ceramic article meets relevant requirements in this Directive and Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004.\nThe written declaration shall permit an easy identification of the goods for which it is issued and shall be renewed when substantial changes in the production bring about changes in the migration of lead and cadmium.\u2019"}
