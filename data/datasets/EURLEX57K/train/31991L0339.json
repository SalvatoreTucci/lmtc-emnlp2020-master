whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods,  persons, services and capital is ensured;\nWhereas Directive 76/769/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 91/338/EEC (5), imposes, in its version as amended by Directive 85/467/EEC (6), severe restrictions on the marketing and use of PCBs and PCTs as a consequence of the risks to man and the  environment;\nWhereas several substitutes have been developed to replace PCBs; whereas some of these substitutes, though less dangerous to man and the environment than PCBs and PCTs, nevertheless constitute a potentially high risk to man and the environment;\nWhereas it is therefore necessary to restrict the marketing and use of these substitutes;\nWhereas the substance bearing the trade name Ugilec 141 has been on the market since 1981; whereas this substance or preparations containing this substance are currently used as a dielectric fluid in condensers and transformers and as a hydraulic fluid  in coal mines; whereas it is recognized that this substance is less dangerous to man and the environment than the PCBs it was designed to replace;\nWhereas by virtue of its ecotoxcity, persistence and potential to bioaccumulate, this substance nevertheless constitutes a high risk to the environment; whereas significant environmental contamination has already been documented in the vicinity of  mining operations using this substance as a hydraulic fluid; whereas in the event of a fire involving any equipment containing this substance highly toxic substances may be given off; whereas final disposal of Ugilec 141 requires special procedures;\nWhereas the substance bearing the trade name Ugilec 121 or Ugilec 21, being a new substance, was notified on 15 March 1984, in accordance with Council Directive 79/831/EEC of 18 September 1979 amending for the sixth time Directive 67/548/EEC on the  approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (7) and can therefore be marketed throughout the Community; whereas this substance has similar  properties and behaviour and was intended for uses similar to that Ugilec 141; whereas the manufacturer has subsequently withdrawn the substance Ugilec 121 or 21 voluntarily from the market; whereas restrictive measures are necessary to ensure that the  preparations or products containing the said substance are not re-introduced on the market at a future date;\nWhereas the substance bearing the trade name DBBT, being also a new substance, was notified in accordance with Directive 79/831/EEC on 16 February 1988 and can therefore be marketed throughout the Community; whereas the intended use of this substance  either on its own or in preparations is as a hydraulic fluid in coal mines; whereas in the meantime a temporary official authorization granted in one Member State has expired; whereas such usage can be expected to result in significant environmental  contamination; whereas by virtue of its ecotoxicity, persistence and potential to bioaccumulate this substance constitues a potentially high risk to the environment; whereas restrictive measures should be introduced before this substance has become  established on the Community market;\nWhereas effective replacements or alternative approaches already exist which make the continued use of these three substances unnecessary;\nWhereas restrictions on use or marketing already adopted by certain Member States in respect of the substances referred to above or of preparations or products containing them have a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the internal  maket; whereas it is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field, and consequently to amend Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC,", "main_body": ["The following points are hereby added to Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC:\n'25.
