In order to simplify the administration of those provisions and encourage extensive participation by the organisations in the sector, some of the conditions for approval of associations of producer organisations in the sector should be amended.\n(2) Since the provisions on the funding of work programmes are new, drawing up work programmes by approved operators' organisations requires considerable preparatory work.
