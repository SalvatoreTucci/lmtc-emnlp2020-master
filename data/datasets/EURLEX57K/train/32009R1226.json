the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year

stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks\u00a0(3), and in particular Articles 5 and 8(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, as well as in the light of any advice received from the Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council.\n(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States.\n(3) In order to ensure effective management of fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.\n(4) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag.\n(5) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified.\n(7) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with Community legislation, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States\u2019 catches of fish\u00a0(4), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels\u00a0(5), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels\u00a0(6), Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic\u00a0(7), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy\u00a0(8), Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems\u00a0(9), Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound\u00a0(10), Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\u00a0(11).\n(8) To ensure that annual fishing opportunities are set at a level commensurate with the sustainable exploitation of resources in environmental, economic and social terms, account has been taken of the guiding principles for fixing total allowable catches (TACs) as described in the Communication from the Commission on the Consultation on fishing opportunities for 2010.\n(9) In order to reduce discards, it is appropriate to establish a high-grading ban for any species subject to quota, implying a prohibition on discarding species subject to quota that can legally be caught and landed under Community fisheries legislation.\n(10) To help conserve fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2010.\n(11) To ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2010. Given the urgency of the matter, it is necessary to grant an exception to the 6-week period referred to in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject matter\nThis Regulation fixes fishing opportunities for 2010 for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and the associated conditions under which such fishing opportunities may be used.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to Community fishing vessels (Community vessels) operating in the Baltic Sea.", "Definitions\nIn addition to the definitions laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, for the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) zones are the geographical areas specified in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005;\n(b) \u2018Baltic Sea\u2019 means ICES Subdivisions 22-32;\n(c) \u2018total allowable catch\u2019 (TAC) means the quantity that can be taken from each stock each year;\n(d) \u2018quota\u2019 means a proportion of the TAC allocated to the Community, a Member State or a third country;\n(e) \u2018day absent from port\u2019 means any continuous period of 24 hours or part thereof during which the vessel is absent from port.\nCHAPTER II\nFISHING OPPORTUNITIES AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS", "Catch limits and allocations\nThe catch limits, the allocation of such limits among Member States, and associated conditions set out in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 are set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Special provisions on allocations\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The allocation of catch limits among Member States as set out in Annex I shall be without prejudice to:\n(a) exchanges made pursuant to Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002;\n(b) reallocations made pursuant to Articles 21(4), 23(1) and 32(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93;\n(c) additional landings allowed under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(d) quantities withheld in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96;\n(e) deductions made pursuant to Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 338/2008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of withholding quotas to be transferred to 2011, Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 may apply, by way of derogation from that Regulation, to all stocks subject to analytical TAC.", "Conditions for catches and by-catches\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fish from stocks for which catch limits are fixed shall only be retained on board or landed if:\n(a) the catches have been taken by vessels of a Member State with a quota and that quota has not been exhausted;
