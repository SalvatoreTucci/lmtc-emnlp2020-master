The exemption is granted on the basis of the results of a review process carried out by technical experts taking into account available evidence from studies, stakeholders and other scientific/technical sources. This review concluded that the elimination or substitution of the substance is still technically or scientifically impracticable until 1 July 2007. A similar exemption is provided in Directive 2000/53/EC on End of Life Vehicles.\n(3) Some exemptions from the prohibition for certain specific materials or components should be limited in their scope, in order to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, given that the use of those substances in such applications will become avoidable.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of Directive 2002/95/EC each exemption listed in the Annex must be subject to a review at least every four years or four years after an item is added to the list.\n(5) Directive 2002/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2002/95/EC, the Commission has consulted the relevant parties.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC the following point 28 is added:\n\u201828.
