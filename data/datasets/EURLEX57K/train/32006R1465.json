However, the quantity and quality of the products in intervention storage may, temporarily and occasionally, make it necessary to dispose of them for other purposes, in particular to meet the Community\u2019s undertakings, where the situation of stocks so warrants and where supply to traditional food markets is not threatened.\n(3) The rise in processing cereals to produce biofuels for use in Community transport forms part of a raft of measures designed to meet the Community\u2019s environmental commitments. Promoting the use of biofuels may therefore open a new market for agricultural products held in intervention storage in the Member States, provided that prices applicable to the sale of cereals reflect this specific market in biofuels. Nonetheless, purchasing cereals to produce bioethanol and its use as a biofuel may prove particularly difficult. Provision should therefore be made for selling intervention stocks at special prices in such cases.\n(4) Intervention stocks of cereals are sold on the Community market according to availability and market conditions. Sales may be influenced by or dependent upon specific or exceptional circumstances on those markets, and must therefore be able to take account of such situations. To this end, provision should be made for prices that avoid market disturbances and ensure that sales reflect the above circumstances. This twofold objective can be achieved if the selling price is equal to the price on the market concerned, account being taken of the quality of the cereals put up for sale by tender and of transport costs.\n(5) In the interests of sound management of the cereals intervention scheme, the information to be communicated by Member States to the Commission should be clarified. This information should be sent by electronic means.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. Article 5 is replaced by the following:\n(a) in the case of resale of maize and grain sorghum during the first three months of the marketing year and of common wheat, durum wheat, rye and barley during the first two months of the marketing year, successful tenders shall quote a price at least equal to the intervention price applicable for the 11th month of the preceding marketing year, plus one monthly increase fixed for that year;\n(b) in the case of resale during the rest of the marketing year, tenders may in no circumstances be lower than the intervention price applicable on the closing date for the submission of tenders. However, the intervention prices to be taken into account during the 12th month of the marketing year shall be those applicable for the 11th month, plus one monthly increase.\n2.
