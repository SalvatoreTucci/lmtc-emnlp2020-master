Substitution of mercury or of the specific component would shorten product life or impair performance significantly.\n(3) Both the substitution of mercury in the connector and the elimination of mercury via substitution of the connector or the device are technically impracticable or have negative overall impacts due to an impact on patients' health.\n(4) The use of mercury in electric rotating connectors used in intravascular ultrasound imaging systems capable of high operating frequency modes of operation (>\u00a050 MHz) should therefore be exempted until 30 June 2019. In view of the innovation cycles for medical devices this is a short transition period which is unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(5) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the ninth month after entry into force at the latest.
