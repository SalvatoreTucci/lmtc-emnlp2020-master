The value of the services provided by financial intermediaries being allocated among different customers, the actual payments or receipts of interest to or from financial intermediaries need to be adjusted to eliminate the margins that represent the implicit charges made by financial intermediaries. The estimated value of these costs should be subtracted from the interest paid by borrowers to financial intermediaries and added to the interest received by depositors. The costs are regarded as remuneration for services rendered by financial intermediaries to their clients and not as an interest payment (see 2.107.1 and 2.108(i); ESA 95, Appendix I, 4.51).\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 138/2004, item 19.10 \u2018Other goods and services\u2019 is replaced by the following two items:\nItem List of variables Transmission concerning reference year n\nNovember January September\n\u201819.10 Financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) X X X\n19.11 Other goods and services X X X\u2019"}
