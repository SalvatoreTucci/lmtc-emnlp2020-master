This definition has given rise to problems of interpretation and has also made checks difficult by obliging the physical presence of animals on the land to be verified. It is necessary to make the rules easier for farmers to understand the said definition and to simplify checks. Therefore the definition of a producer in a less-favoured area should be amended,", "main_body": ["Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3493/90 shall be replaced by:\n\"2.
