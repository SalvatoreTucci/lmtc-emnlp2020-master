This is in conformity with the consumption and production trends of the different meats concerned and would not lead to any increase in total meat production.\n(5) Finland has requested the amendment of the provision introduced by Decision 97/279/EC regarding the separation of amounts in Annex III and IV for the poultry sector, in order to allow some flexibility in the number of livestock units and the aid payable inside the sector without amending either the level of the unit aid or the total aid admissible for the sector. This is in conformity with the principles of the aid scheme.\n(6) Finland has requested that the livestock unit coefficient for nanny goats in Annex V be increased to allow the total amount of aid admissible to be paid per livestock unit instead of partially paying it on the basis of the amount of milk produced. The possibility of paying aid partially on the basis of the amount of milk produced should be ended, by amending Annex III to refer to cow's milk only. This is in conformity with Decision 95/196/EC, as the total amount of aid for the sector remains unchanged.\n(7) Since in accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(3) Finland has decided not to apply this upper limit under the common organisation of the market, it appears appropriate to remove this limit in respect of national aids as well.\n(8) Finland has requested that the livestock density applied in the case of suckler cows and male bovine animals should apply to those animals only. Since Commission Decision 2000/167/EC of 22 December 1999 approving a Finnish national aid programme implementing in particular Article 141 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden(4) already provides for this possibility, the Commission considers this request to be justified in particular in order to avoid any discrimination between producers in different parts of Finland.\n(9) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92(5) has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(6).\n(10) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89(7), has been replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 of 3 November 1998 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat(8).\n(11) Inclusion of the SLOM quantities allocated in 1997 and 1998 justify certain amendments to Annexes II, III and IV to Decision 95/196/EC.\n(12) Some technical corrections should be made to Annex III as regards the total aid admissible for horses and aid admissible for sheep and nanny goats, Annex IV as regards \"Other UAA\" and \"Total UAA\" and Annex VI as regards the grand total for potatoes for starch.\n(13) The national authorities should have the necessary time to prepare the annual information to be provided for the Commission.\n(14) Decision 95/196/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(15) In view of the nature and scope of the amendments, and at the request of Finland, this Decision should apply from 1 January 2000 with the exception of the amendments with regard to overshoots in the meat sector, which should apply from 1 January 1998, and with the exception of the amendments with regard to the entry for milk in Annex II and the entry for dairy cows in Annex IV, which should apply from 1 January 1999,", "main_body": ["Decision 95/196/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
