In order to improve the animal health status worldwide and consequently lower the animal disease risk in the EU, it is important that the EU approach to animal health and welfare be shared with all member countries of the OIE and that the EU actively supports conferences, training seminars and meetings and activities organised by the OIE in order to promote the Union\u2019s animal health and welfare policy at the occasion.\nGlobal conferences of the OIE reference centres and on aquatic animal health; regional seminars for OIE focal points of Europe for communication, for animal disease notification and for veterinary products; regional meetings and activities of the animal welfare platform for Europe; regional meetings and activities on African Swine Fever in the region of Europe and to implement Foot and Mouth Disease Progressive Control Pathway (FMD PCP) in Central Asia and West Eurasia; regional meetings and activities of the Mediterranean Animal Health Network (REMESA) including rabies vaccine bank and FMD PCP in Northern Africa; regional education activities on OIE animal welfare standards in the OIE region of Asia, Far East and Oceania.\nThe objective of the action is to share the EU approach to animal health and welfare and veterinary public health with all members of the OIE through the promotion of the Union\u2019s policy at the occasion of conferences, training seminars and meetings and activities organised by the OIE.
