These regulatory authorities have to be wholly independent from the interests of the electricity and gas industry.\n(3) The detailed responsibilities and tasks of the national regulatory authorities are likely to differ between Member States, but all Member State will have to designate at least one regulatory agency to apply the rules of the new regulatory framework once they have been transposed into national law, in particular those concerning day-to-day supervision of the market.\n(4) Directives 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC establish objectives to be achieved and provide a framework for action at the national level, but give flexibility in certain areas to apply the rules in the light of national conditions. Consistent application of the relevant rules in all Member States is essential for the successful development of a single European energy market.\n(5) As regards common approaches to issues relevant for cross-border transactions the European Electricity Regulatory Forum and the European Gas Regulatory Forum have made important contributions. Whilst the two Forums will remain important as comprehensive discussion platforms involving all players from government, regulators and industry, it is now necessary to give regulatory cooperation and coordination a more formal status, in order to facilitate the completion of the internal energy market and in view of the forthcoming accession of new Member States.\n(6) In those circumstances, a \"European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas\" should be established to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in Member States, and between these bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal market and ensuring the consistent application in all Member States of Directives 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003.\n(7) The members of the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas should comprise the heads of the national authorities competent in the field of electricity and gas regulation in the Member States. The Commission should be represented at a high level.\n(8) The European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas should maintain close cooperation with the Committees established under Article 30 of Directive 2003/55/EC and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003. Its work should not interfere with the work of those Committees.\n(9) It is appropriate to repeal Commission Decisions 95/539/EC(4) and 92/167/EEC(5) since these Decisions set up Committees in the context of Directives 91/296/EEC(6) and 90/547/EEC(7) on transit of natural gas and electricity, respectively, which were repealed by Directives 2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and activities\n1.
