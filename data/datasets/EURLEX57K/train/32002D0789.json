However, the legislation in Botswana did not fully include the requirement for official notification of avian influenza.\n(3) Botswana has now amended its legislation to ensure that avian influenza is to be notified to the competent authority.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to permit importation of live ratites and hatching eggs from Botswana.\n(5) Decision 2001/751/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2001/751/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 18 October 2002.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 October 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 303, 31.10.1990, p. 6.\n(2) OJ L 323, 7.12.2001, p. 29.\n(3) OJ L 281, 25.10.2001, p. 24.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX I\nList of third countries or parts of third countries, which are allowed to export live ratites or hatching eggs thereof to the Community\n>TABLE>\""}
