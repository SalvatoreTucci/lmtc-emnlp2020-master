To that end, the Regulation requires the Member States to set up national bovine databases which will record the identity of the animal, all holdings on its territory and the movements of the animals. In addition, it imposes an obligation on keepers of animals to report to the competent authority, inter alia, all movements to and from the holding, along with the dates of these events, within a period fixed by the Member State of between three and seven days of the event occurring.\n(2) The Regulation provides for the possibility for the Commission at the request of a Member State to extend that maximum period and to set up special rules applicable to different mountain areas, which was done by means of Commission Decision 2001/672/EC of 20 August 2001 laying down special rules applicable to movements of bovine animals when put out to summer grazing in mountain areas\u00a0(2).\n(3) Pursuant to recital 4 of Decision 2001/672/EC these special rules must result in a real simplification and foresee only what is absolutely necessary to guarantee the fully operational character of the national bovine databases.\n(4) Decision 2001/672/EC applies to such movements during the period from 1 May to 15 October. Practical experience with the application of that Decision has shown that in some mountain areas movements to summer grazing areas start already in April. The scope of application of Decision 2001/672/EC should be amended accordingly to take account of that fact.\n(5) Under certain conditions, animals, which are moved from different holdings to the same summer grazing mountain area, arrive there over a period of more than seven days. In order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens, time limits in Decision 2001/672/EC should therefore be adapted to take account of that practical fact without compromising traceability.\n(6) Decision 2001/672/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["Decision 2001/672/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1 the date \u20181 May\u2019 is replaced by \u201815 April\u2019;\n2.
