This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(8).\n(6) The two tariffs relating to boned loins and hams, fresh, chilled or frozen, coming under CN codes ex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 and ex\u00a00203\u00a029\u00a055 and bearing numbers 09.4038 and 09.4170 and the tariff for pigmeat originating from Canada and bearing number 09.4204, experience of which is still low, should continue to be managed using the simultaneous examination method. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(9) should apply to these three tariffs, unless otherwise provided by this Regulation.\n(7) Due to the particularities of the transfer from one administrative system to the other, it is important that the tariffs managed using the \u2018first come, first served\u2019 system should be regarded as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(10) should apply, unless otherwise provided in this Regulation.\n(9) It is important to define the methods for submitting import licence applications, the information needed to be contained in such applications and licences as well as the amount of the security relating to import licences. In view of the speculative risk inherent in the method in question in the pigmeat sector, precise conditions relating to operators\u2019 access to the tariff quota scheme also need to be laid down.\n(10) Regulations (EC) No 806/2007, (EC) No 812/2007, (EC) No 979/2007 and (EC) No 1382/2007 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation. However, it is appropriate to maintain these applicable regulations for the import tariff periods prior to those covered by this Regulation.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS", "Opening and management of tariffs\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation opens and manages import tariff quotas for the pigmeat sector products indicated in Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariffs indicated in Annex I, Part A, to this Regulation shall be managed in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
