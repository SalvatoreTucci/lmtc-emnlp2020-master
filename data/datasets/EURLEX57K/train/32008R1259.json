The large cheese weighs 2-3\u00a0kg and is approximately 20\u00a0cm in diameter. The small cheeses weigh 1\u00a0kg, 500\u00a0g or 350\u00a0g.\nFat content is at least 50\u00a0% and dry matter not less than 52\u00a0%.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nCentral Massif Central comprising the following municipalities:\nThe Puy-de-D\u00f4me department: all municipalities\nThe Cantal department: all municipalities\nThe Haute-Loire department:\nThe Aveyron department:\nThe Corr\u00e8ze department:\nThe Lot department:\nThe cantons of Bretenoux, Figeac-Est, Figeac-Ouest, Gramat, Lacapelle-Marival, Latronqui\u00e8re, Martel, Saint-C\u00e9r\u00e9, Sousceyrac and Vayrac: all municipalities\nThe canton of Livernon: the municipalities of Assier, Issepts, Reyrevignes, Saint-Simon and Sonac\nThe canton of Souillac: the municipalities of Lacave, Mayrac, Meyronne, Pinsac et Saint-Sozy\nThe Loz\u00e8re department:\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nEvery milk producer, processing plant and maturing plant fills in a \u2018declaration of aptitude\u2019 registered with the INAO which allows the INAO to identify all operators involved. All operators must keep at the INAO\u2019s disposal their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese must be manufactured and matured in the geographical area.\nManufacture still involves the same processes as in the past: draining the curd, putting it into moulds, salting by hand, in two stages, using dry coarse salt and turning the cheese over several times, then pricking using long needles, as this airing of the cheese allows penicillium glaucum to develop. The cheese is then ripened in cellars for at least four weeks for the large cheeses and a minimum of two weeks for the small cheeses.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nThe origin of this cheese dates back to the beginning of the 19th century when it was made on the high volcanic land of the Massif Central. Its reputation extended rapidly as far as Paris where in 1879 the popular singer Francisque Bathol sang its praises. Bleu d\u2019Auvergne was granted designation of origin status in March 1975 following the application made in 1972.\nThe area where Bleu d\u2019Auvergne is made is unique, characterised by volcanic and granitic earth, rich in trace elements, with a harsh climate, all of which is conducive to a very specific type of flora, which contributes to the particular qualities of Bleu d\u2019Auvergne whose unique flavour is brought out by using specific strains of penicillin, developed and produced in the Bleu d\u2019Auvergne AOC area. The methods for draining the curd and for salting by hand give Bleu d\u2019Auvergne a very fine marbling, uniformly spread throughout the cheese, which distinguishes it from other blue cheeses.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName: Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress: 51, rue d'Anjou \u2014 F-75008 PARIS\nTel.
