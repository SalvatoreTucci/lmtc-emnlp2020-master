Information provided by the French authorities shows that this will be insufficient to cover the needs of the overseas departments in 2002. The quantity should therefore be increased by 50 animals for 2002.\n(3) Following detection of a material error, the tariff code for frozen carcasses and half-carcasses of meat of domestic swine referred to in Annex II, Part 10 to Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 should be corrected.\n(4) The forecast supply balance for fresh and chilled meat of bovine animals (CN code 0201 ) in the Canary Islands provides for an annual quantity of 20000 tonnes. Information provided by the Spanish authorities shows that this will be insufficient to cover the needs of the Islands for direct consumption in 2002. The quantity should therefore be increased by 1000 tonnes for 2002. However, the information shows an under-utilisation of the quantity of frozen beef, initially fixed at 16500 tonnes for 2002. As a result, this quantity should be reduced by 1650 tonnes.\n(5) The measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees for Beef and Veal and Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 21/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
