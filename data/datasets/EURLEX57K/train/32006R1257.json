This is due to the fact that they do not affect the essential characteristics of the product and do not alter its link with the geographical area.\n(7) For the protected geographical indication, \u2018Nocciola di Giffoni\u2019, the amendments to the specification referred to in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should therefore be approved without following the procedure set out in Articles 6(2) and 7 of that Regulation.\n(8) The particulars referred to in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should also be published.

In particular, the \u2018Nicciola di Giffoni\u2019 is cultivated in a local biotope favouring the characteristics of the plant in conjunction with climate factors peculiar to the defined area, which is located in hazel-growing districts of Campania. This is a conducive environment for growing the \u2018Tonda di Giffoni\u2019 variety since the soil, which is volcanic in nature and origin, offers the best conditions from a fertility point of view.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body:\nName : IS.ME.CERT\nVia G.
