Those Decisions provided that imports into the Community from the concerned countries of live poultry, other live birds, poultry meat and certain other products of poultry origin, meat and meat products of wild and farmed game birds, game trophies of birds, eggs and egg products thereof were banned, subject to limited exceptions.\n(3) The measures laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 745/2004 of 16 April 2004 laying down measures with regard to imports of products of animal origin for personal consumption\u00a0(3) clearly apply to meat and meat products of wild and farmed game birds.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 745/2004 requires all Member States to bring the rules as laid down to the attention of passengers at all designated EU points of entry. Member States should ensure that this information is particularly brought to the attention of those passengers arriving from avian influenza affected countries. The information shall be displayed by prominent notices placed in easily visible locations. International passenger transport operators shall draw the attention of all passengers they carry into the Community to the animal health conditions for imports into the Community of products of animal origin.\n(5) In relation to the risk that the Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 could also be spread due to wild birds and in particular migratory birds, the Commission has also adopted Decisions 2005/731/EC\u00a0(4), 2005/732/EC\u00a0(5) and 2005/726/EC\u00a0(6) providing for additional avian influenza surveillance in domestic poultry and wild birds.\n(6) General requirements for the maintenance of a high level of disease preparedness and in particular for the implementation of veterinary supervision and biosecurity measures are laid down in Communit legislation, notably Directives 90/425/EEC and 92/40/EEC.\n(7) Highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has been recently confirmed in Turkey. Circumstantial evidence and molecular epidemiology data strongly suggest that the avian influenza virus has spread into this country proceeding from central Asia via migratory birds.\n(8) Avian influenza has also been confirmed in Romania in a backyard poultry farm in an area with a high density of migratory birds.\n(9) In order to reduce the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 introduction into poultry farms and other premises where birds are kept in captivity via wild birds it is appropriate to strengthen the Community measures already in place to tackle that risk.\n(10) The measures of this Decision should be risk-based and not limited to short term actions such as those implemented within the framework of the National Contingency Plans for Avian Influenza or Newcastle Disease, in case an outbreak occurs.\n(11) The Member States should inform the Commission by 5 November 2005 of the measures taken to ensure proper implementation of this decision. Those measures and, if appropriate, this Decision are to be reviewed in the Standing Committee and Animal Health at its meeting scheduled for 10 and 11 November 2005.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Biosecurity measures\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take appropriate and practicable measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (hereinafter \u2018avian influenza\u2019) from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds, taking into account the criteria and risk factors set out in Annex I to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the specific epidemiological situation, the measures of paragraph 1 shall be directed in particular at:\n(a) preventing direct and indirect contact between birds living in the wild, and in particular waterfowl, on the one hand and poultry and other birds, and in particular ducks and geese, on the other hand,\n(b) ensuring separation between domestic ducks and geese from other poultry.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that when animal health checks are undertaken on poultry holdings, they shall be done in a way to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Decision.", "Early detection systems\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall introduce early detection systems in the areas of their territory that they have identified as being particularly at risk for the introduction of avian influenza, taking into account the criteria set out in Annex II to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The early detection systems shall be aimed at a rapid reporting of any sign of avian influenza in poultry and other captive birds by the owners or keepers to the competent veterinary authority.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular in this context, the criteria set out in Annex II shall be taken into account.", "The Member States shall amend their legislation so as to bring it into compliance with this Decision and they shall give immediate appropriate publicity to the measures adopted.
