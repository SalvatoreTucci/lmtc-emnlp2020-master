Bearing in mind that an object may take longer than 24 hours to pass through the gastrointestinal tract, the time period of 24 hours specified for the test method may not be sufficient to test the risk of physical injury in cases where small toys or components of toys are swallowed.\n(7) Furthermore, the risk of physical injury is particularly serious when small portions or segments can be detached easily. Although Clause 4.6 of the relevant harmonised standard requires toys and component parts of toys to undergo the cylinder test, it does not take into account the possibility that, in the case of certain toys which do not fit into the cylinder and have no small component parts, children can nevertheless easily bite, twist or gouge small portions out of the material.\n(8) Consequently, on the basis of the information submitted by the Spanish authorities, the other national authorities, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the Standing Committee established by Directive 98/34/EC, it is clear that compliance with harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 \u2018Safety of Toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019 can no longer be presumed to entail conformity with the essential safety requirements, in so far as concerns Clause 4.6 of that standard, and Clause 8.14 thereof, to the extent that it relates to the 24-hour submergence test.\n(9) It is therefore necessary to provide for an appropriate notice to accompany publication of the references of the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 \u2018Safety of Toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019,", "main_body": ["In the case of toys and component parts of toys made of expanding materials, harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 \u2018Safety of Toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019, as adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 15 July 1998, does not satisfy the essential safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 88/378/EEC, in so far as concerns Clause 4.6 thereof and Clause 8.14, to the extent that it relates to the 24-hour period during which a toy is to be submerged in a container.", "The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the references of harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 \u2018Safety of Toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019, as adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 15 July 1998, shall be accompanied by the following additional notice:\n\u2018Clause 4.6 of standard EN 71-1:1998 and Clause 8.14 thereof, in so far as it relates to the 24 hour period during which a toy must be submerged in a container, do not cover all the risks presented by toys and component parts of toys made of expanding materials.
