A tolerance limit for quantity losses resulting from normal storage operations carried out in accordance with the accepted rules is hereby fixed for each agricultural product which is the subject of a public storage measure.\n2. The tolerance shall be fixed as a percentage of the actual weight, without packing, of the quantities entering storage and taken over during the financial year in question, plus the quantities in storage at the beginning of that year. It shall be  calculated, for each product, on the basis of all the quantities stored by an intervention agency.\nThe actual weight at buying-in and removal are calculated by subtracting the standared packing weight, as laid down in the conditions of buying-in, from the recorded weight or, by absence, the average packing weight used by the agency.\n3. The tolerance shall not cover losses in terms of number of packages or number of registered pieces.  Article 2\n1. The percentages for normal allowable losses during storage are hereby fixed as follows:\n- cereals  0,2 %  - paddy rice-maize-sorghum  0,4 %  - sugar  0,1 %  - olive oil  0,6 %  - rapeseed  0,2 %  - sunflower seed  0,8 %  - alcohol  0,6 %  - leaf tobacco  0,0 %  - baled or transformed tobacco  1,0 %  - skimmed milk powder  0,0 %  -  butter  0,0 %  - cheese: Grana Padano  4,5 %  Parmigiano Reggiano  6,5 %  - beef  0,6 %  - pigmeat  to be defined later.\n2. The percentages for allowable losses during processing are hereby fixed as follows:\n- de-boning of beef 32 %\n- processing of leaf tobacco 19 %.\nThese percentages shall apply to all quantities processed during the financial year.  Article 3\nLosses exceeding the tolerance shall be booked at the end of the EAGGF Guarantee Section financial year.  Article 4\nThe percentages laid down in Article 2 shall be reviewed, at the latest after three years, on the basis of checks carried out following the application of the new methods of calculation.
