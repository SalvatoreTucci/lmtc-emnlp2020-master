Within the 24-hour period before loading a consignment of pigs intended for slaughter, the competent veterinary authority shall ensure that the body temperature of a number of pigs of the said consignment is monitored by an official veterinarian inserting a thermometer into the rectum.

A disease investigation shall be initiated and take into account the provisions of Article 4 of Directive 2001/89/EC introducing Community measures for the control of classical swine fever.\n2. Shortly (0-3 hours) before loading of the consignment examined as described under point 1, a clinical examination shall be carried out by an official veterinarian designated by the competent veterinary authorities.\n3. At the time of loading of the consignment of pigs examined as described under point 1 and point 2, the official veterinarian shall issue a health document, which shall accompany the consignment to the designated slaughterhouse.\n4.

The minimum number of the pigs to be checked must allow for the detection of fever if it occurs at a prevalence of 20 % with 95 % confidence in the premise where the pigs to be moved are kept. However, in case of breeding sows or boars, the minimum number of pigs to be checked must allow for the detection of fever if it occurs at a prevalence of 5 % with 95 % confidence in the premise where the pigs to be moved are kept. The checking of temperature must primarily concern the following pigs or group of pigs:\n- sick or anorexic pigs,\n- pigs recently recovered from disease,\n- pigs recently introduced in the holding or for which any contact with a potential source of classical swine fever virus has been identified,\n- pigs already sampled and serologically tested for classical swine fever, in case the results of these tests do not allow to rule out classical swine fever.\nPART II\nPROCEDURES FOR THE SAMPLING AND TESTING OF PIGS AT SLAUGHTER\nBlood samples for serological tests or blood or tonsils samples for virological tests must be taken from the pigs proceeding from each premise of the holding from which they have been moved.\nThe minimum number of samples to be taken must allow for the detection of 10 % seroprevalence or virus prevalence with 95 % confidence in each premise.\nThe type of samples to be taken and the test to be used will be in accordance with the instructions of the competent authority, which will take into account the range of tests that can be performed, the sensitivity of these tests and the epidemiological situation.\nIn case clinical signs or post-mortem lesions suggesting classical swine fever are detected when the pigs are slaughtered or killed, the competent authority shall ensure that further appropriate sampling and virological testing are immediately carried out."}
