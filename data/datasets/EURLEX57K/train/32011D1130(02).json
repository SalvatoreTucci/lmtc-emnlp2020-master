It emphasises the importance of reinforcing the growth of the European economy while delivering high levels of employment productivity, a low carbon economy and social cohesion.\n(2) One of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, set out in the Communication from the Commission entitled \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019\u00a0(2), gives a prominent role to improved standard setting in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) to ensure interoperability between ICT applications, services and products with a view to reducing fragmentation of the digital single market while at the same time promoting innovation and competition.\n(3) Another flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy, set out in the Communication from the Commission entitled \u2018An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era \u2014 Putting competitiveness and sustainability at centre stage\u2019\u00a0(3), calls on Europe to develop a standards system

membership organisations active in Europe that within their area of expertise develop standards in the field of ICT.\n(7) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the platform should be
