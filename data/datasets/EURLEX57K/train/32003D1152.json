Accordingly, provision should be made whereby the Commission and the Member States make the necessary resources available for the development and deployment of the system.\n(8) In developing the national components, Member States should apply the principles laid down for electronic government systems and should treat the economic operators in the same way as in the other fields where computer systems are set up. In particular, they should allow the economic operators, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises active in this sector, to use these national components at the lowest possible cost, and they should promote all measures aimed at preserving their competitiveness.\n(9) The division between the Community and non-Community components of the computerised system should also be defined, as should the respective duties of the Commission and the Member States with regard to the system's development and deployment. In that context, the Commission, assisted by the relevant Committee, should fulfil a major role in coordinating, organising and managing the system.\n(10) Arrangements should be made for evaluating the implementation of the computerised system for monitoring excisable goods.\n(11) The funding of the system should be shared between the Community and the Member States, the Community's share being specifically entered as such in the general budget of the European Union.\n(12) Establishing the computerised system serves to enhance the internal-market aspects of the movement of excisable goods. Any fiscal aspects relating to the movement of excisable goods should be addressed by amending Directive 92/12/EEC. This Decision does not prejudice the legal basis of any future amendments to Directive 92/12/EEC.\n(13) Before the EMCS is operational, and given the problems which have been experienced, the Commission, in collaboration with Member States, and taking account of the views of the trade sectors concerned, should look at ways to improve the current paper-based system.\n(14) This Decision lays down, for the entire period needed for the development and the deployment of the system, a financial framework constituting the prime reference within the meaning of Point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(6), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),", "main_body": ["1. A computerised system for the movement and surveillance of excisable products of the kind referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive 92/12/EEC, hereinafter referred to as \"the computerised system\", is hereby established.\n2. The computerised system is intended to:\n(a) permit the electronic transmission of the accompanying document provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92, and the improvement of checks;\n(b) improve the functioning of the internal market, by simplifying the intra-Community movement of products under excise duty suspension arrangements, and by affording Member States the possibility of monitoring the flows in real time and of carrying out the requisite checks where necessary.", "Member States and the Commission shall establish the computerised system within six years of the entry into force of this Decision.\nActivities relating to the initiation of application of the computerised system shall begin not later than 12 months after the entry into force of this Decision.", "1.

No Member State shall take any action relating to the setting up or running of the computerised system that might affect the system's internal links and overall interoperability or its functioning as a whole.\nAny measure that a Member State might wish to take and that could affect either the computerised system's internal links and overall interoperability or its functioning as a whole shall be taken only with the prior agreement of the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 7(2).\n3. Member States shall inform the Commission regularly of any measure they may have taken to enable their respective administrations to make full use of the computerised system.

Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.", "1. The Commission shall take whatever other steps are necessary to verify that the measures financed from the general budget of the European Union are being carried out correctly and in compliance with the provisions of this Decision.\nIt shall regularly, in collaboration with the Member States, meeting in the Committee referred to in Article 7(1), monitor the various development and deployment stages of the computerised system with a view to determining whether the objectives pursued have been achieved, and to issuing guidelines on how to raise the effectiveness of the activities involved in implementing the computerised system.\n2. 30 months after the entry into force of this Decision, the Commission shall submit to the Committee referred to in Article 7(1) an interim report on the monitoring operations. If appropriate, this report shall set out methods and criteria to be used in the later evaluation of how the computerised system is functioning.\n3. At the end of the six-year period referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the implementation of the computerised system. The report shall set out, inter alia, the methods and criteria to be used in the later evaluation of how the system is functioning.", "The countries that have applied for membership of the European Union shall be kept informed by the Commission of the development and deployment of the computerised system and may, if they so desire, take part in the tests to be carried out.", "0\n1. The costs of setting up the computerised system shall be split between the Community and the Member States in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.\n2. The Community shall bear the costs of the design, acquisition, installation and maintenance of the Community components of the computerised system and the ongoing operating costs of those Community components installed in Commission premises, or in those of a subcontractor designated by the Commission.\n3.
