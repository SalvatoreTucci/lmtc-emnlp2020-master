In order to respond to market needs, it is appropriate to make these stocks available on the internal market.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards the buying in and sale of sugar by intervention agencies\u00a0(2) should apply to such a sale.\n(3) However, Article 22(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 providing for the publication of the invitation of tender in the \u2018C\u2019 series of the Official Journal of the European Union at least 10 days before the period for submission of tenders expires should not apply as Member States have difficulties for the translation into all Community languages and this will create unnecessary delays in the sales of their intervention sugar. Furthermore, Article 28(1)(a) of the said Regulation provides for a tendering security of EUR 0,73 per 100 kilograms. For the sale of intervention sugar on the internal market, the security lodged by the tenderer should be brought in line with the intervention price. As a consequence, Article 28(1)(a) should not apply.\n(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(5) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to\u00a0the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender on the Community internal market a total quantity of 1\u00a0009\u00a0124 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale on the internal market.
