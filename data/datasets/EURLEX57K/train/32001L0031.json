Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(2) Directive 98/90/EC has introduced design requirements for the steps and handholds of cabs in order to improve the safety of persons entering and leaving the driver's compartment of certain heavy goods vehicles.\n(3) Certain cab designs already on the market cannot comply with the specific requirements introduced by Directive 98/90/EC, although their level of safety is considered equivalent.
