Those changes need to be reflected in Articles 5 and 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001\u00a0(3) and in Part H of Annex I to that Regulation.\n(2) Whilst the current quota is managed on the basis of a yearly period running from July to June, the increased quota will be managed on a calendar year basis. By way of derogation from Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, which provides for division into two equal parts for 6-month periods, the available quantity for 2012 should take account of the quantity of 2\u00a0000 tonnes already made available in 2011 for the first half of 2012. Consequently, only a quantity of 1\u00a0600 tonnes should be available for the subperiod which, for organisational reasons, is to start on 1 March 2012. However, this Regulation should be without prejudice to the quantity of 2\u00a0000 tonnes already made available for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2012.\n(3) Since the period for lodging import licence applications for the first half of 2012, as provided for in Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, has expired, provision should be made for a new period for submitting import licence applications and for a derogation from that Article in relation to the quantity of 1\u00a0600 tonnes for the subperiod March-June 2012. In order to avoid that applicants who already lodged applications in November 2011 for the quantity of 2\u00a0000 tonnes would be excluded from the new submission period, it is appropriate to provide for a derogation from Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(4).\n(4) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 provides for the notification of the quantities covered by import licences within 2 months of expiry of the validity of the licences in question. However, for purposes of good management, it is necessary for the Commission to have this information at an earlier stage. An appropriate notification obligation should therefore be provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001\nRegulation (EC) No 2535/2001 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 5, point (h) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(h) the quotas provided for in Annex V to the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway, approved by Council Decision 2011/818/EU\u00a0(5), hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Agreement with Norway\u201d;\n(2) in Article 16, the following paragraph 5 is added:\n(3) in Article 19(1), point (g) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(g) Rules referred to in point 9 of the Agreement with Norway;\u2019;\n(4) Part H of Annex I is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Derogation from Regulations (EC) No 2535/2001 and (EC) No 1301/2006\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 and Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, for the quota for the period from 1 March to 30 June 2012 relating to a quantity of 1\u00a0600 tonnes, as set out in Part H of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 as amended by the Annex to this Regulation, applications for import licences may be lodged from 1 to 10 March 2012.\nThose applications shall relate to not less than 10 tonnes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licences issued in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be valid until 30 June 2012.", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 March 2012.\nHowever, this Regulation shall be without prejudice to the quantity of 2\u00a0000 tonnes already made available for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 February 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 9.12.2011, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 341, 22.12.2001, p. 29.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 238, 1.9.2006, p. 13.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 9.12.2011, p. 1.\u2019;\nANNEX\n\u2018I.
