Data on the physical aspects of European agriculture\nThis is a continuation of the work done in previous years. The aim is to improve the following:\n(a) data on areas, production and use of crops, and particularly the balances;\n(b) data on livestock populations, production and use of animal products, and particularly the meat balances;\n(c) feed balances (development of the feed balances, by improving the estimation methods and achieving better consistency between the supply balances and the feed balance;\n(d) other work with a view to improving figures on stocks or internal use, including use on the farm, and technical coefficients.\n2. The environmental aspects of agricultural accounting\nThe main aim is to test the feasibility of introducing into the methodology used for the economic accounts for agriculture (EAC) and forestry (EAF) concepts and definitions that enable certain elements which are relevant to the environment to be dealt with as services in total production, subsidies or taxes.\n3. The agri-environmental indicators and the use of pesticides\nThe Commission wishes to encourage projects permitting the improvement of the existing indicators such as, in particular, regional-level information on yields of certain crops, data on the sale or consumption of mineral fertilisers etc. It also supports the establishment of landscape indicators such as the lengths of hedges or walls or the areas used at regional level outside the utilised agricultural area (pasture, alpine meadow etc.); the effects of structural characteristics on the operation of holdings; data on cultivation practices.\nThe activity on the use of pesticides aims to continue collecting and processing data on the use of pesticides and improving the quality and speed of transmission by using a variety of methods and sources. Crops are selected by the Member States on the basis of their importance in terms of areas under cultivation or amounts of pesticides used.\n4. Rural development\nThis developing area in agricultural statistics will involve a more detailed territorial breakdown of information normally collected at national level and territorial breakdowns that differ from the administrative regions used for the production of most regional statistics. A wider range of subjects will also be covered, including non-agricultural income of farms and families - particularly from activities that are complementary to agricultural activity and community services provided by farmers - and living conditions in rural regions, agriculture's contribution as a support to other economic and cultural activities etc.\nTable A\nTECHNICAL ACTION PLAN 2003\nmaximum Community contribution to costs incurred\nby Member State\n>TABLE>"}
