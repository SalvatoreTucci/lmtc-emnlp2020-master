These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the DSV to the Commission.\n(7) However, the Community inspection team was not able to verify the inspection capacity of the DSV as regards the freezer or factory vessels because at the time of the inspection the two proposed freezer vessels were registered under French flag and no factory vessel was proposed to be authorised. Therefore, the inclusion of new vessels in the list will require a new inspection visit on the spot by the Commission experts.\n(8) It is appropriate for the present Decision to be applied 45 days after its publication in providing for the necessary transitional period.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The \"Direction des Services V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires (DSV) of the Direction de l'Agriculture et de la For\u00eat (DAF)\" belonging to the \"Minist\u00e8re fran\u00e7ais de l'agriculture et de la p\u00eache\", shall be the competent authority in Mayotte identified for the purposes of verifying and certifying compliance of fishery products with the requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC.", "Fishery products imported into the Community from Mayotte shall comply with Articles 3, 4 and 5.", "1.
