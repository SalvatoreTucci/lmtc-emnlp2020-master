The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by Ireland in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2011, the average ageing period for Irish whiskey in 2011 was five years.\n(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 899/2011 of 7 September 2011 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Irish whiskey for the period 2011/12\u00a0(3) has exhausted its effects, as it concerns the coefficients applicable for the year 2011/2012.
