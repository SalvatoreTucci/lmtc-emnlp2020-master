It has on several occasions expressed concern about the failure to ensure the primacy of civilian authority and to abide by the principles of good democratic governance in Guinea-Bissau.\nIn application of Article 96 of the the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the European Union has therefore engaged in a political dialogue with the government in order to study the situation and possible solutions. Following the agreement of the Guinea-Bissau government, the consultations opened in Brussels on 29 March 2011.\nDuring the meeting the participants discussed the necessary measures for ensuring the primacy of civilian authority, improving democratic governance, guaranteeing the safeguarding of constitutional order and the rule of law and tackling impunity and organised crime. Prior to the consultations, the Guinea-Bissau authorities submitted a memorandum with proposals designed to assuage the concerns raised in the European Union\u2019s letter.\nThe European Union noted these undertakings in the course of the consultations, particularly as regards:\n\u2014 the conduct and conclusion of judicial investigations and proceedings that are fully independent and carried out under appropriate logistic and security conditions, relating to the assassinations in March and June 2009,\n\u2014 the effective implementation of the security sector reform based on the strategy adopted by the national parliament and the legislative package drawn up with the support of the EU\u2019s CSDP mission,\n\u2014 the renewal of the military hierarchy to ensure the appointment to senior command of persons not involved in unconstitutional or illegal conduct or acts of violence, in conformity with the conclusions and recommendations of the Ecowas roadmap for security sector reform,\n\u2014 the approval of and assistance to an experts\u2019 mission to support security sector reform and the protection of political figures, to be carried out with the support of Ecowas, the CPLP and/or other partners,\n\u2014 the preparation, adoption and effective implementation of national operational plans to implement security sector reform and to combat drug trafficking,\n\u2014 the improvement of the administrative and financial management of civilian and military employees, and measures to combat money laundering.\nIn its conclusions following the consultations the European Union urged the representatives of Guinea-Bissau to undertake judicial investigations and proceedings into the events of 1 April 2010 to reinforce efforts to tackle the problem of impunity and to specify a more detailed timetable for implementation of these undertakings in compliance with the time-frame set out in the Ecowas roadmap.\nThe European Union found the undertakings made by Guinea-Bissau broadly encouraging. Accordingly, it was decided to close the consultations and to adopt appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement.\nThe gradual resumption of cooperation with a view to safeguarding the essential elements referred to in the the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement will take place in the following stages as set out in Annex I (schedule of commitments):\n1. The European Union is continuing to finance ongoing contracts, humanitarian and emergency operations, measures in direct support of the people of Guinea-Bissau and projects to combat transnational crime and support the consolidation of democracy. Guinea-Bissau is eligible for the EDF MDG initiative. The allocation of funding under regional projects covering Guinea-Bissau and from other EDF facilities (water, energy, etc.) and the launch of preparatory measures for the implementation of future projects, including the preparation and implementation of future operations by the European Investment Bank, will be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n2. The suspension of projects and programmes in the \u2018Conflict Prevention\u2019 focal sector (with the exception of Projust, Paracem and disbursement of contributions to the RSS pension fund under the PARSS programme to support reform of the security sector), the \u2018Water and Energy\u2019 focal sector (Bissau Electrification Project) and outside the focal sectors (the Sustainable Management of Road Transport Project and Private Sector Support Programme) will be lifted as soon as the following take place:\n(i) submission of a detailed timetable for implementation of security sector reform undertakings in compliance with the Ecowas roadmap;\n(ii) the finalisation, adoption, enactment and publication of the security sector reform legislative package drawn up with the support of the EU\u2019s CSDP mission;\n(iii) the approval of and assistance to an experts\u2019 mission to support security sector reform and the protection of political figures, to be carried out with the support of Ecowas, the CPLP and/or other partners; and\n(iv) the preparation, adoption and a start to effective implementation of national operational plans to implement security sector reform and to combat drug trafficking and money laundering.\n3. Disbursement of the EDF\u2019s first contribution to the retirement pension fund for elderly surplus staff in the security sector (PARSS programme, 9th EDF), conditional on payment of the government\u2019s and Ecowas\u2019s contributions, will be subject to:\n(i) the conduct and conclusion of judicial investigations and proceedings that are fully independent and carried out under appropriate logistic and security conditions, relating to the assassinations in March and June 2009; and\n(ii) improvements in the administrative and financial management of public, civilian and military employees in Guinea-Bissau.\n4. The European Union will envisage resuming budget support, resumption of the new support programme for the justice sector (Projust, \u2018Conflict Prevention\u2019 focal sector), and preparing a new support programme for civil and military reforms (Paracem, \u2018Conflict Prevention\u2019 focal sector), after:\n(i) continued effective implementation of national operational plans to implement security sector reform and to combat drug trafficking and money laundering;\n(ii) the commencement of judicial investigations and proceedings into the events of 1 April 2010;\n(iii) renewal of the military hierarchy to ensure the appointment to senior command of persons not involved in unconstitutional or illegal conduct or acts of violence, in conformity with the conclusions and recommendations of the Ecowas roadmap for security sector reform.\nThe European Union reserves the right to amend these measures in the light of the changing political situation and progress in the implementation of commitments.\nAs part of the procedure under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Guinea-Bissau closely over a period of 12 months. During this period an enhanced dialogue will be pursued with the government under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement with a view to safeguarding the essential elements referred to in that Agreement. Regular reviews will be conducted by the European Union; the first monitoring mission should in principle take place within six months.\nThe two parties undertake to hold a regular political dialogue under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement on reforms in the area of political, judicial and economic governance, paying particular attention to the reform of the security sector, measures to tackle impunity and organised crime, particularly drug trafficking.\nWe have the honour to be, Sirs, yours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
