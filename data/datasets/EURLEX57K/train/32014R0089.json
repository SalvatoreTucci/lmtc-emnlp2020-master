That list includes bis(N-cyclohexyl-diazenium-dioxy)-copper (Cu-HDO).\n(2) Cu-HDO has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 8 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 25 February 2008 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 December 2013, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from that report that biocidal products used for product-type 8 and containing Cu-HDO may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve Cu-HDO for use in biocidal products for product-type 8.\n(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Bis(N-cyclohexyl-diazenium-dioxy)-copper (Cu-HDO) shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 8, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Identification Numbers Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nCu-HDO IUPAC Name: 981\u00a0g/kg 1 September 2015 31 August 2025 8 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n1.
