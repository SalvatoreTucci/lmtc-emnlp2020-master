Point 4 of that Chapter requires that bulk foodstuffs in liquid, granulate or powdered form be transported in receptacles and/or containers/tankers reserved for the transport of foodstuffs. However, that requirement is not practical and imposes an unduly onerous burden on food business operators when applied to the transport in seagoing vessels of liquid oils and fats intended for, or likely to be used for, human consumption. In addition, the availability of seagoing vessels reserved for the transport of foodstuffs is insufficient to serve the continuing trade in such oils and fats.\n(2) Commission Directive 96/3/EC\u00a0(2) permits the transport by sea of bulk liquid oils and fats in tanks which have been previously used to transport the substances listed in the Annex thereto, subject to certain conditions which ensure the protection of public health and the safety and wholesomeness of the foodstuffs concerned.\n(3) In view of the discussion in Codex Alimentarius leading to the adoption of criteria to be used to determine the acceptability of previous cargoes for bulk edible liquid oils and fats transported by sea\u00a0(3) and at the Commission's request, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assessed the criteria for acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils and adopted a scientific opinion on the review of the criteria for acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils\u00a0(4).\n(4) At the Commission's request, the EFSA also evaluated a list of substances taking into account those criteria. The EFSA has adopted several scientific opinions on the evaluation of the substances on their acceptability as previous cargoes for edible fats and oils\u00a0(5)\n\u00a0(6)\n\u00a0(7)\n\u00a0(8).\n(5) In the interests of clarity of Union legislation and to take into account the outcome of the EFSA scientific opinions, Directive 96/3/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Derogation\nBy way of derogation to point 4 of Chapter IV of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, liquid oils or fats which are intended for or likely to be used for human consumption (\u2018oils or fats\u2019) may be transported in seagoing vessels which are not reserved for the transport of foodstuffs subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of this Regulation.", "Conditions for derogation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The freight carried preceding the oils and fats in the same equipment in a seagoing vessel (hereafter called the \u2018previous cargo\u2019) shall consist of a substance or a mixture of substances listed in the Annex to this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bulk transport in seagoing vessels of liquid oils or fats which are to be processed shall be permitted in tanks that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, subject to the following conditions:\n(a) where the oils or fats are transported in a stainless steel tank, or tank lined with epoxy resin or technical equivalent, the immediately previous cargo shall have been:\n(i) a foodstuff; or\n(ii) a cargo from the list of acceptable previous cargoes set out in the Annex;\n(b) where the oils or fats are transported in a tank made of materials other than those referred to in point (a), the three\u00a0previous cargoes transported in the tank shall have been:\n(i) foodstuffs; or\n(ii) a cargo from the list of acceptable previous cargoes set out in the Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bulk transport in seagoing vessels of oils or fats which are not to be further processed shall be permitted in tanks that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, subject to the following conditions:\n(a) the tank shall be:\n(i) of stainless steel; or\n(ii) lined with epoxy resin or technical equivalent;\n(b) the three previous cargoes transported in the tank shall have been foodstuffs.", "Record keeping\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The captain of the seagoing vessel transporting, in tanks, bulk oils and fats shall keep accurate documentary evidence relating to the three preceding cargoes carried in the tanks concerned, and the effectiveness of the cleaning process applied between those cargoes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the cargo has been transhipped, in addition to the documentary evidence required in paragraph 1, the captain of the receiving seagoing vessel shall keep accurate documentary evidence that the transport of the bulk oils or fats complied with the conditions laid down in Article 2 during the previous shipment and of the effectiveness of the cleaning process used between those cargoes on the other vessel.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon request, the captain of the seagoing vessel shall provide the competent authority with the documentary evidence provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2.", "Repeal\nDirective 96/3/EC is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 96/3/EC of 26 January 1996 granting a derogation from certain provisions of Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs as regards the transport of bulk liquid oils and fats by sea (OJ L\u00a021, 27.1.1996, p.\u00a042).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, Codex Alimentarius Commission, Thirty-fourth Session, International Conference Centre, Geneva, Switzerland, 4 to 9 July 2011, REP11/CAC, Para. 45-46.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain on a request from the European Commission on the review of the criteria for acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils.
