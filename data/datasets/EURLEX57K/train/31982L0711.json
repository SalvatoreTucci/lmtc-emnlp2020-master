This Directive is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC.\n2. This Directive shall apply to plastic materials and articles, that is to say to materials and articles and parts thereof:\n(a) consisting exclusively of plastics, or\n(b) composed of two or more layers of materials, each consisting exclusively of plastics, which are bound together by means of adhesives or by any other means,\nwhich, in the finished product state, are intended to come into contact or are brought into contact with foodstuffs and are intended for that purpose.\n3. For the purposes of this Directive, 'plastics' shall mean the organic macromolecular compounds obtained by polymerization, polycondensation, polyaddition or any other similar process from molecules with a lower molecular weight or by chemical alteration of natural macromolecules. Silicones and other similar macromolecular compounds shall also be regarded as plastics. Other substances or matter may be added to such macromolecular compounds.\nHowever, the following shall not be regarded as 'plastics':\n(i) varnished or unvarnished regenerated cellulose film;\n(ii) elastomers and natural and synthetic rubber;\n(iii) paper and paperboard, whether modified or not by the addition of plastics;\n(iv) surface coatings obtained from:\n- paraffin waxes, including synthetic paraffin waxes, and/or micro-crystalline waxes,\n- mixtures of the waxes listed in the first indent with each other and/or with plastics.\n4. This Directive shall not apply to materials and articles composed or two or more layers, one or more of which does not consist exclusively of plastics, even if the one intended to come into direct contact with foodstuffs does consist exclusively of plastics.\nA decision on the application of this Directive to the materials and articles referred to in the first subparagraph and on any adaptations to the Directive that may become necessary shall be taken at a later date.", "1.

In the absence of methods of analysis determined in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 76/893/EEC which make it possible to determine the level of migration into foodstuffs, that level shall be determined in the simulants listed in Chapter I of the Annex.\n3. The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 100 of the Treaty and on a proposal from the Commission, shall draw up a list of substances or matter whose use is authorized to the exclusion of any others and a list of simulants to be used for each foodstuff or group of foodstuffs and shall determine the concentration thereof.", "1.

(a) However, where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since this Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that for a given plastic material or article the basic rules laid down in the Annex for migration tests are technically unsuitable or because the actual conditions of use are basically different from the test conditions specified in the table in the Annex, that Member State may,\nwithin its territory and only for the particular case, temporarily suspend application of the basic rules referred to in the Annex and permit the use of more appropriate basic rules.

General case: plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs of all types\nThe tests are to be carried out using all the simulants mentioned below, taking a fresh sample of the plastic material or article for each simulant:\n- distilled water or water of equivalent quality (= simulant A),\n- 3 % acetic acid (w/v) in aqueous solution (= simulant B),\n- 15 % ethanol (v/v) in aqueous solution (= simulant C),\n- rectified olive oil (1); if for technical reasons connected with the method of analysis it is necessary to use different simulants, olive oil must be replaced by a mixture of synthetic triglycerides (2) or by sunflower oil (= simulant D).\n2. Special case: plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with a single foodstuff or a specific group of foodstuffs\nThe tests are to be carried out:\n- using only the simulants specified as appropriate for the foodstuff or group of foodstuffs in the list referred to in Article 2 (3),\n- where the foodstuff or group of foodstuffs is not included in the list referred to in the first indent, selecting the simulant or simulants prescribed in Section 1 which correspond most closely to the extractive capacity of the foodstuff or group of foodstuffs.\nCHAPTER II\nTest conditions (times and temperatures)\n1. The migration tests are to be carried out, selecting from the times and temperatures specified in the table those which correspond most closely to the normal or foreseeable conditions of contact for the plastic materials or articles being studied.\n2. If a plastic material or article is intended to be used successively at short intervals in several of the conditions of contact referred to in column 1 of the table, migration will be determined by subjecting that material or article successively to all the corresponding test conditions specified in column 2, using the same simulant.\n3. For a given test time, where a plastic material or article passes the test at the higher temperature, the test need not be repeated at the lower temperature.\nFor a given test temperature, where a plastic material or article passes the test over the longer time, the test need not be repeated over the shorter time.\n(1) Characteristics of rectified olive oil:\n- iodine index (Wijs) = 80 to 88,\n- refraction index at 25 \u00b0C = 1;4665 to 1;4679,\n- acidity (expressed in % of oleic acid = 0;5 % maximum,\n- peroxide index (expressed in milli-equivalents of oxygen per kg of oil) = 10 maximum.\n(2) Characteristics of the standard synthetic triglycerides mixture as described in K. Figge's article, 'Food cosmet. Toxicol' 10 (1972) 815.\nTABLE\nTest conditions (times (t) and temperatures (T)) to be chosen according to conditions of contact in actual use\n1.2 //   //   // Conditions of contact in actual use  // Test conditions  //   //   // 1  // 2  //   //   // 1.

T > 121 \u00b0C  // In accordance with national laws  //   //\n(1) For plastic materials and articles in contact with foodstuffs for which a preservation temperature of less than 20 \u00b0C is specified on the labelling or by law, the test conditions will be 10 days at 20 \u00b0C.\n4.  Where the plastic material or article may in actual use be employed under any conditions of contact time or temperature, only the 10-day tests at 40 \u00b0C and the two-hour tests at 70 \u00b0C are to be carried out, these being conventionally regarded as the most stringent.\nIf simulant D is used (rectified olive oil or substitutes for it), only the 10-day test at 40 \u00b0C is to be carried out.\n5. If it is found that carrying out the tests under the conditions specified in the table causes physical or other changes in the plastic material or article which do not occur under normal or foreseeable conditions of use of that material or article, the migration tests should be carried out under conditions more appropriate to the specific case."}
