That application was accompanied by the relevant data supporting the request for the change.\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 November 2010 that the data provided from three trials in chickens for fattening do not support the reduction of the minimum recommended dose from 4\u00a0000 XU and 900 BGU/kg feed to 2\u00a0000 XU and 450 BGU/kg feed because analyses of the feeds showed that the intended doses were considerably exceeded. However, the data showed that the product is efficacious at a lower dose than the one currently authorised. According to the Authority the data indicates, as an approximation, that 3\u00a0000 XU and 600 BGU/kg feed has the potential to improve growth rate and feed to gain ratio in chickens for fattening\u00a0(5).\n(4) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 14.11.2009, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a01 XU is the amount of enzyme which releases 1 \u03bcmol of reducing sugar (xylose equivalent) per minute from xylan of oat spelt at pH 5,0 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a01 BGU is the amount of enzyme which releases 1 \u03bcmol of reducing sugar (cellobiose equivalent) per minute from \u00df-glucan of barley at pH 4,8 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(12):1919.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
