Although the use of vaccine in the framework of pre-emptive killing is only useful where the expected delay in killing exceeds the time required to build-up sufficient immunity to reduce effectively the spread of virus, it should under no circumstances compromise the progress in reducing the number of animals of susceptible species around outbreaks.\n(8) In its report of 10 March 1999 the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare made recommendations on the strategy for emergency vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease, which must be taken into account(9).\n(9) Recourse to any kind of vaccination will inevitably jeopardise the foot-and-mouth disease status in terms of international trade not only for the Member State or part of its territory where vaccination is carried out.\n(10) The Commission prior to taking a Decision on emergency vaccination must ensure that the measures to be taken include at least those provided for in Article 13(3) first to sixth indent of Directive 85/511/EEC.\n(11) It is the purpose of this Decision to define the conditions under which the Netherlands may apply emergency vaccination.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \"Pre-emptive killing\" shall mean the killing of susceptible animals on holdings within a certain radius around holdings placed under the restrictions laid down in Articles 4 or 5 of Directive 85/511/EEC.\nIt is aimed at the urgent reduction of numbers of animals of susceptible species in an infected area.\n2. \"Suppressive vaccination\" shall mean emergency vaccination of animals of susceptible species in identified holdings situated in a defined area, the vaccination zone, which is carried out exclusively in conjunction with pre-emptive killing as defined in paragraph 1.\nIt is aimed at an urgent reduction of the amount of virus circulating and the risk of virus spreading beyond the perimeters of the area without delaying the pre-emptive killing.\nIt shall only be carried out where the pre-emptive killing of animals of susceptible species must be delayed for an estimated time most likely exceeding the time required to effectively reduce the spread of virus by immunisation for at least one of the following reasons:\n- constraints on the execution of killing of animals of susceptible species in compliance with the provisions in Directive 93/119/EEC,\n- constraints on the available capacities to destroy killed animals in accordance with Article 5(2) second indent of Directive 85/511/EEC.", "1. Without prejudice to Directive 85/511/EEC, and in particular Articles 4, 5 and 9 thereof, the Netherlands may decide on resorting to suppressive vaccination under the conditions set out in the Annex.\n2.
