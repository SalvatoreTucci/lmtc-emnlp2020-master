The emergence of this disease represents a serious risk to the Community\u2019s livestock population.\n(2) In order to prevent the spread of the disease as rapidly as possible, the Community must contribute financially to the eligible expenditure incurred by the Member State in the context of the emergency measures taken to combat the disease, as provided for in Decision 90/424/EEC.\n(3) Various decisions, notably the latest one, Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones\u00a0(3), have been adopted by the Commission in order to demarcate the protection and surveillance zones and to set out the conditions governing movements of animals from these zones.\n(4) Bluetongue is a disease transmitted exclusively by \u2018mosquitoes\u2019, therefore the only measures which are apposite, of all those provided for in Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, are those aimed either at protecting animals against attacks from the vectors (treatment with insecticides, confining the animals indoors at the times when the vectors are active) or at preventing the spread of the epidemic through movements of animals (Decision 2005/393/EC). The slaughter of animals of susceptible species is not an apposite measure except in the case of animals clinically affected with bluetongue.\n(5) Due to the evolution of the disease, it is advisable to implement a vaccination campaign in the protection zones established around outbreaks of bluetongue.\n(6) Vaccination is a measure which, employed in combination with apposite eradication measures, makes it possible to:\n(a) reduce mortality in sheep;\n(b) prevent viraemia in cattle and thus enable cattle to be moved from restricted zones.\n(7) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules are financed by the \u2018Guarantee\u2019 section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The auditing of these measures comes under Articles 8 and 9 of the said Regulation.\n(8) The payment of the financial contribution from the Community must be subject to the condition that the actions planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information within the time limits laid down.\n(9) On 28 December 2004 Portugal submitted an initial estimation of the costs incurred in the context of the emergency measures taken to combat the disease. This estimation, updated on 25 February 2005, amounts to EUR\u00a09\u00a0005\u00a0320.\n(10) Pending checks by the Commission, it is now necessary to set the amount for payment of the first instalment of the Community financial assistance. This first instalment must be equal to 50\u00a0% of the Community contribution, established on the basis of the estimated costs of compensating livestock farmers for the slaughter of animals and other costs.\n(11) The terms \u2018swift and adequate compensation of the livestock farmers\u2019 used in Article 3 of Decision 90/424/EEC, \u2018reasonable payments\u2019 and \u2018justified payments\u2019 and the categories of eligible expenditure under \u2018other costs\u2019 associated with compulsory slaughter must all be defined.\n(12) The Portuguese authorities have fulfilled all their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 3 of Decision 90/424/EEC.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Approval of the vaccination campaign\nThe bluetongue vaccination campaign implemented by Portugal in the zones listed in Annex
