This means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria set out in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approval certification body is required.\n(2) Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined shall be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications. It is therefore desirable to identify the products referred to in the technical specifications.\n(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC. It is therefore necessary to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures shall be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.\n(4) The procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III. The procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in the relevant European technical approvals.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 September 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30.8.1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nInternal covering system of gypsum fibre boards (EOTA ref. 05.04/01):\nFor uses except those subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A1(1), A2(2), B(3), C(4).\nPrefabricated cavity trays (EOTA ref. 06.04/05)\n(1) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(2) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(3) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(4) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\nANNEX II\nInternal covering system of gypsum fibre boards (EOTA ref. 05.04/01):\nFor uses subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A1(1), A2(2), B(3), C(4).\nCouplings and sleeves for standardised reinforcing bars (EOTA ref. 03.01/02)\nCorrugated steel reinforcement sheets (for composite structural floor systems) (EOTA ref. 05.02/02)\nPile joint (connection device for load-bearing pre-cast concrete piles) (EOTA ref. 01.03/09)\nRock shoe (anchoring device for load-bearing pre-cast concrete piles) (EOTA ref. 01.03/09)\n(1) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(2) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(3) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\n(4) Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material).\nANNEX III\nATTESTATION OF CONFORMITY\nNote:\nfor products/kits having more than one of the intended uses specified in the following tables, the tasks for the approved body, derived from the relevant systems of attestation of conformity, are cumulative.\nSIX PRODUCTS FOR EUROPEAN TECHNICAL APPROVALS (TABLE 1/3)\nSystems of attestation of conformity\nFor the product(s) and intended use(s) listed below, EOTA is requested to specify the following system(s) of attestation of conformity in the relevant European technical approval:\n>TABLE>\nThe specification for the system should be such that it can be implemented even where performance does not need to be determined for a certain characteristic, because at least one Member State has no legal requirement at all for such a characteristic (see Article 2(1) of Directive 89/106/EEC and, where applicable, clause 1.2.3 of the Interpretative Documents).
