If a national type-approval number is required to be indicated the manufacturer can place it either on a plate separate from the manufacturer's plate or on the manufacturer's plate itself.\"\nIn points 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.1.7 and 2.1.8:\n\"weight\" shall read \"mass\".\nPoint 3.1 shall be amended to read as follows:    3.1. It must be marked on the manufacturer's plate, and also on the chassis, frame or other similar structure.      3.1.1. It must consist of three sections.        3.1.1.1. The first section shall consist of a code assigned to the vehicle manufacturer to enable him to be identified. The code shall comprise three characters, letters or figures which shall be assigned by the competent authorities of the country where the manufacturer has his principal place of business, by agreement with the international agency acting under the authority of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The first character shall designate a geographical area, the second a country within a geographical area, and the third a specific manufacturer.\nWhere the manufacturer produces less than 500 vehicles per year, the third character shall always be \"9\". In order to identify such manufacturers, the competent authority referred to above shall also assign the third, fourth and fifth characters of the third section.\n3.1.1.2. The second section shall be composed of six characters (letters or figures) which shall serve to indicate the general characteristics of the vehicle. If the manufacturer does not use one or more of these characters, the unused spaces must be filled by alphabetical or numerical characters, of the manufacturer's choice.\n3.1.1.3. The third section, composed of eight characters, of which the last four must be numerical, must in conjunction with the other two sections provide clear identification of a particular vehicle. Any unused space must be filled by a zero in order that the total number of characters required may be fulfilled.\n3.1.2. It must wherever possible be marked on a single line.\nAs an exception, for technical reasons, it may also be marked on two lines. However, in this latter case no section may be divided between the two lines. The beginning and end of each line must be indicated by a symbol which is neither an arabic numeral nor a roman capital letter, and which cannot be confused with either. This requirement may be waived in the case of manufacturer's plates where the number is marked on one line only. It is also permissible to place such a symbol between the three sections on one line (point 3.1.1).\nThere must be no spaces between the characters.\nAPPENDIX MODEL OF THE MANUFACTURER'S PLATE\nThe examples below do not prejudice the data which are actually to appear on manufacturers'plates.
