Under the terms of Directive 2003/29/EC Member States had to bring into force national legislation no later than 1 July 2003, the last date of application referred to in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC being 30 June 2003.\n(3) Certain Member States had notified the Commission by 31 December 2003 of their wish to adopt derogations from Directive 96/49/EC. By Commission Decision 2005/180/EC of 4 March 2005 authorising Member States to adopt certain derogations pursuant to Council Directive 96/49/EC with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail\u00a0(3), the Commission authorised the adoption by those Member States of the derogations listed in Annexes I and II to that Decision.\n(4) Commission Directive 2004/89/EC\u00a0(4) again amended the Annex to Directive 96/49/EC. Under the terms of Directive 2004/89/EC Member States had to bring into force national legislation at the latest by 1 October 2004, the last date of application referred to in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC being 30 September 2004.\n(5) The United Kingdom notified the Commission by 31 December 2004 of its wish to amend its existing derogations in Annex I to Decision 2005/180/EC. The Commission has examined the notifications for compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC and has approved them. That Member State should therefore be authorised to adopt the derogations in question.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend Annex I to Decision 2005/180/EC.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the transport of dangerous goods, set up under Article 9 of Council Directive 94/55/EC\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/180/EC is hereby amended as follows:\nAnnex I shall be amended by the derogations listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nJacques BARROT\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 25.
