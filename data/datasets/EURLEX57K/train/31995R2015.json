whereas  in order to avoid discrimination between producers, the provision concerning the treatment of  certain land set aside should be expanded to include set-aide land covered by those two Regulations  as a result of a request under one or other of the two Regulations from 28 June 1995; whereas  provision should be made for exempting the land in question from compliance with certain provisions  of Commission Regulation (EC) No 762/94  (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1664/95, which  are incompatible with the requirements of these two Regulations;\nWhereas these changes will first apply to the set-aside scheme in the 1996/97 marketing year;\nWhereas in the context of the application of the integrated system, separate declarations should be  made in respect of parcels set aside either for environmental reasons pursuant to Regulation (EEC)  No 2078/92 or for afforestation pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 which are deducted under  the set-aside arrangements introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92;

whereas Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No  762/94 incorrectly refers to the rotational set-aside obligation only; whereas reference should be  made to the other two forms of set-aside obligation also;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EC) No 2990/94 of 5 December 1994 derogating from Regulation (EEC) No  1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops as regards the  set-aside requirement for the 1995/96 marketing year  (11) derogates from the set-aside requirement  contained in Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 for the 1995/96 marketing year and set the level of the  rotational requirement at 12  %; whereas the Regulation was published in December 1994; whereas  producers in Portugal sowed their winter crops on the basis of the law then in force, under which  the level of the rotational requirement was 15  % and that for other forms of set-aside was 20  %,  pending the payment of direct aid in respect of all set-aside land; whereas, in view of the  legitimate expectations of Portuguese producers, direct aid should be paid to them, for 1995/96, in  respect of the area of land set aside in excess of the set-aside obligation, of up to 15  % in the  case of rotational set-aside and 20  % in the case of other forms of set-aside;\nWhereas it is necessary therefore to amend Regulation (EC) No 762/94;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 762/94 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
