In order to achieve this, the threshold for the economic size of agricultural holdings for Slovakia should be increased from EUR 15\u00a0000 to EUR 25\u00a0000.\n(3) In the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 the total number of returning holdings for Slovakia has been fixed at 523. In order to guarantee a better representativeness of the Slovak sample, the number of returning holdings for Slovakia should be increased by 39 and fixed at 562 returning holdings.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2, the indent concerning Slovakia is replaced by the following:\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the 2013 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 15.12.2009, p. 27.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 347, 24.12.2009, p. 14.\nANNEX\nThe row concerning Slovakia in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1291/2009 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018810 SLOVAKIA 562\u2019"}
