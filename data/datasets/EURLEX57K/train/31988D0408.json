Reductions Member States may reduce the central standard rate for fees pursuant to Article 2 (2):\n(a)  in general, where there are substantial differences in the cost of living and salary costs;\n(b)  for individual establishments where the following conditions are met:\n-  a minimum daily slaughter rate enabling the deployment of the relevant inspection staff to be planned in advance,\n-  the number of slaughtered animals must be constant, so that animal deliveries may de planned in advance thus enabling rational use to be made of the inspection staff,\n-  strict organization and planning within the establishment together with a rapid slaughter rate and optimum use of inspection staff,\n-  no waiting or otherwise non-productive periods for inspection staff,\n-  the animals for slaughter must so far as possible be uniform in age, size, weight and state of health.\n2.  Increases In order to cover increased costs, Member States may increase the central standard rate for fees pursuant to Article 2 (2).\nThis would be subject, for example, to one or more of the following conditions:\n-  higher inspection costs due to a particular lack of uniformity in the animals for slaughter from the point of view of age, size, weight and state of health,\n-  longer waiting and otherwise non-productive periods for inspection staff owing to inadequate advance planning by the establishment of animal deliveries or technical inadequacies or failures, for example in older establishments,\n-  frequent delays in the slaughtering process, e.g. as a result of insufficient slaughter staff and hence under-employment of inspection staff,\n-  higher costs due to special travelling times,\n-  more time taken up on inspections due to frequently changing slaughter periods beyond the control of inspection staff,\n-  frequent interruptions in the slaughtering process to meet cleaning and disinfecting requirements,\n-  inspections of animals for slaughter and of meat at the request of the person liable for fees, outside established inspection times.\nThe amount of the increases in the central standard rate for fees shall depend on the level of the costs to be covered.\nEWG:L111UMBE08.97 FF: 1UEN;   SETUP: 01;   Hoehe: 254 mm;   35 Zeilen;   2287 Zeichen;\nBediener: OLLI   Pr.: C;\nKunde:"}
