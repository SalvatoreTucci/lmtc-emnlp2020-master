The nitrogen application from livestock manure on grassland would not exceed 230 kg per hectare per year, while on arable crops of these farms it would not exceed 115 kg/ha nitrogen per hectare per year.\n(4) The designation of nitrates vulnerable zones in respect to Wallonia, in conformity with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 3 of Directive 91/676/EEC, covers approximately 42\u00a0% of this region\u2019s territory and 54\u00a0% of utilised agricultural land.\n(5) Approximately 500 farms, corresponding to 5,6\u00a0% of total number of farms in nitrate vulnerable zones, and 3\u00a0% of the Utilised Agricultural Land are estimated to be encompassed by the derogation.\n(6) The legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC in Wallonia \u2018Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du Gouvernement wallon du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2007 modifiant le Livre II du Code de l\u2019Environnement constituant le Code de l\u2019Eau en ce qui concerne la gestion durable de l\u2019azote en agriculture\u2019 has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.\n(7) Water quality data submitted show that in Wallonia in 2005 average nitrate concentration in surface water in nitrate vulnerable zones was 16,7 mg/L, with stable or decreasing trends in 84\u00a0% of monitoring sites in the period from 2001 to 2005. Median groundwater concentration in 2005 was 24,8 mg/L nitrates, with stable or decreasing trends in 74\u00a0% of monitoring sites in the period from 2001 to 2005.\n(8) Average nitrogen input per hectare from livestock manure decreased by 12\u00a0% since 1990 and in 2004 was 101 kg/ha of Utilised Agricultural Land, of which 94\u00a0% from cattle manure, 3\u00a0% from pig manure and 2\u00a0% from poultry manure. Average application of chemical fertilisers decreased for both nitrogen and phosphate since 1990, respectively by 19\u00a0% and by 49\u00a0% and in 2004 was on average of 109 kg/ha and 28 kg/ha respectively for nitrogen and phosphate.\n(9) The supporting documents presented in the notification show that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year of nitrogen from manure is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\n(10) The Commission after examination of the request considers that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from manure will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(11) This Decision should be applicable in connection with the second action programme in force for the region of Wallonia for the period 2007 to 2010.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["The derogation requested by Belgium referred to the region of Wallonia by letter of 19 October 2006, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018cattle farms\u2019 means holdings with more than three livestock units, where at least two-thirds of livestock are cattle;\n(b) \u2018grassland\u2019 means acreage of the cattle farm cultivated with permanent or temporary grassland (generally temporary lies less than four years).", "Scope\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis and subject to the conditions set out in Articles 4, 5 and 6 to cattle farms.", "Annual authorisation and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farmers who want to benefit from a derogation shall submit an application to the competent authorities annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the annual application referred to in paragraph 1 they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities shall ensure that all the applications for derogation are subject to administrative control.
