Accordingly, it should be deleted from the list of border inspection posts. This deletion has been enacted in the package of legal technical adaptations necessary as a result of enlargement.\n(4) In addition, the Greek border with Bulgaria will also cease to be a frontier with a third country, and the existing land border inspection posts on that frontier at Ormenion and Promochonas will lose their function. Accordingly, they should be deleted from the list of border inspection posts. This deletion has also been enacted in the package of legal technical adaptations necessary as a result of enlargement.\n(5) All the proposed new locations in Bulgaria and Romania, put forward as border inspection posts with third countries, have been inspected by the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission who have recommended that those completed satisfactorily should be approved by the Commission. Therefore, those locations should be included in the list of border inspection posts.\n(6) Decision 2001/881/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2001/881/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply subject to and from the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 326, 11.12.2001, p. 44.
