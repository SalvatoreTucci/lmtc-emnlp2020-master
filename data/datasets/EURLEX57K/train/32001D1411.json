In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(12) The priority areas of activity that the Community cooperation framework could support should be defined.\n(13) Effective monitoring and assessment methods need to be established and appropriate information provided for potential beneficiaries and the public.\n(14) Implementation of the cooperation framework should be assessed in the light of the experience gained during the first few years of implementation, and the European Parliament and the Council informed thereof.\n(15) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.(10)\n(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(11),", "main_body": ["A Community framework for cooperation (hereinafter referred to as the \"cooperation framework\") is hereby established in order to provide financial and technical support to networks of local authorities organised in at least four Member States, and including when appropriate cities and towns in the countries referred to in Article 8, with the objective of encouraging the conception, exchange and implementation of good practices in the following fields:\n- implementation at local level of EU environmental legislation,\n- sustainable urban development,\n- local Agenda 21.\nThe main partners shall be the Commission, networks of local authorities, organised urban multi-stakeholders, community networks such as NGOs, universities and other actors, organised at European level.", "1.
