The revision takes account of the fact that many producers have abandoned their cultivated land in recent years, following exceptional weather conditions in the years 2006-2009 manifested by significant droughts and shortages of water supply for irrigation systems, which had a severe impact on the integrity of the network of dams in Cyprus. Accordingly, the overall area for which the single area payment is claimed has been declining since 2007, which demonstrates the permanent nature of such land abandonment and justifies a revision of the utilised agricultural area. Furthermore, the revision follows from the experience gained in recent years from the verification of the eligibility conditions for the single area payment under the single area payment scheme, which resulted in an update of the identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, and which has shown that the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 was less than previously estimated. The agricultural area for the single area payment scheme should therefore be reduced to 127\u00a0000\u00a0ha.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The amendment proposed by this Regulation should apply to aid applications as from calendar year 2013.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["In Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009, the row concerning Cyprus is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Cyprus 127\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to aid applications as from calendar year 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the support schemes for farmers provided for in Titles IV and V thereof (OJ L 316, 2.12.2009, p. 27)."}
