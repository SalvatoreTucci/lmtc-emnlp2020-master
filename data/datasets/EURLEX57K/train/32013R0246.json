The Commission considers it appropriate to introduce the mandatory screening for liquid explosives of airport and air carrier sales of LAGs sealed in security tamper-evident bags (STEBs), as well as of LAGs to be used during the trip for medical purposes or a special dietary requirement, including baby food.\n(4) The Commission is committed to the full lifting of restrictions on the carriage of liquids, aerosols and gels. On the basis of the experience gained from the implementation of screening as of January 2014, the Commission should review the situation by the end of 2014 and define, in close cooperation with all parties concerned, one or more next steps to reach this objective, if possible within the next two years following the first step.\n(5) The Commission should follow closely the technological development of liquid explosives detection systems with a view to possibly allow airports to deploy in the future screening systems which are capable of addressing more threats (such as solid and liquid explosives) efficiently at the same time and of simplifying divesting procedures.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 of 4 March 2010 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security\u00a0(4) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "By 30 June 2013, airports or the entity responsible for screening shall report to the appropriate authorities on the state of the implementation of the rules concerning the deployment and the use of liquid screening equipment.
