It also sets out the conditions for exempting certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban).\n(3) When a vaccination programme has been conducted in a herd, the virus circulation has been reduced to such a level that movements of young animals from the restricted zone to holdings outside the zone where vectors are under control should be considered as representing an acceptable risk.\n(4) On 14 March 2005, a Commission working group on the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the Office international des \u00e9pizooties (OIE) issued a report on different aspects of the rules which should apply to movements of animals as regard bluetongue.\n(5) That working group concluded that viremia exceeding 60 days should not be considered as representing a significant risk for movements of live animals and as a consequence animals protected from vectors attack for more than 60 days should be considered as safe.\n(6) In addition, the working group concluded that as 28 days is the maximum period for a seroconversion after infection, an animal is safe when it has been protected from vectors attack for a period exceeding 28 days and it has tested negatively serologicaly on one occasion only after that period of 28 days.\n(7) The working group also concluded that as a virological test is always positive seven days after the infection, an animal is safe when it has been protected from vectors attack for more than seven days and it has tested negatively virologicaly on one occasion after that period of seven days.\n(8) Decision 2005/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Decision 2005/393/EC\nDecision 2005/393/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the animals originate from a herd vaccinated according to a vaccination programme adopted by the competent authority; and\n(b) the animals:\n(i) have been vaccinated more than 30 days but less than twelve months before the date of movement against the serotype(s) present or possibly present in an epidemiologically relevant area of origin; or\n(ii) are less than two months old at the date of movement and are destined for a holding for fattening, such holding must be protected against vector attacks and registered by the competent authority for the purpose of fattening.\u2019\n2.
