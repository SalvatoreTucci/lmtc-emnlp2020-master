For the purposes of this Directive, \"normal residence\" means the place where a person usually lives, that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living.\nHowever, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a different place from his personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in two or more Member States shall be regarded as being the place of his personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition need not be met where the person is living in a Member State in order to carry out a task of a definite duration. Attendance at a university or school shall not imply transfer of normal residence.\n2. Individuals shall give proof of their place of normal residence by any appropriate means, such as their identity card or any other valid document.\n3.

In the latter event, Member States may levy the taxes mentioned in the Annex for periods exceeding those laid down by this Directive. Member States may also permit the private vehicles referred to in the second sentence of Article 3 (b) to be re-hired to a resident of the Member State of importation with a view to their re-exportation.\n2. Member States may under no circumstances apply, in pursuance of this Directive, tax exemptions within the Community which are less favourable than those which they would grant in respect of means of transport originating in a third country.\n3. The Kingdom of Denmark is authorized to maintain the rules applying in that country in connection with normal residence according to which any person, including a student, in respect of the case referred to in Article 5 (1) (b), is regarded as having his normal residence in Denmark if he lives there for a year or 365 days in a period of 24 months.\nHowever, to avoid double taxation:    - where, as a result of the application of these rules, a person is considered to have two residences, the normal residence of that person is situated where his spouse and children live,\n- in similar cases, the Kingdom of Denmark shall consult with the other Member State concerned to decide which of the two residences should be used for the purposes of taxation.\nBefore a period of three years has elapsed, the Council, on the basis of a report by the Commission, will re-examine the derogation covered by this paragraph and, if necessary, will adopt measures, on a proposal from the Commission based on Article 99 of the Treaty, to ensure the abolition of the derogation.\n4.
