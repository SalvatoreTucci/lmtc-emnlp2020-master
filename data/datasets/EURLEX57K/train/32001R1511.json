The impending adjustment of the refunds applicable to those products has led to the submission of applications for export licences for speculative ends. There is a risk that the issue of licences for the quantities applied for on 16 and 17 July 2001 may lead to an overrun in the quantities of the products concerned normally disposed of by way of trade. Applications covering the products concerned in respect of which export licences have not yet been granted should be rejected,", "main_body": ["No further action shall be taken in respect of applications submitted for export licences for eggs of 16 and 17 July 2001 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1371/95 in respect of category three of Annex I to that Regulation which should have been issued from 25 July 2001.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 25 July 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 July 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 133, 17.6.1995, p. 16.\n(2) OJ L 281, 4.11.1999, p. 16.\n(3) OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 49.\n(4) OJ L 189, 30.7.1996, p. 99."}
