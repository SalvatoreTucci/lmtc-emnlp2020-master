As a supplementary measure the Italian authorities also requested approval for a vaccination programme against avian influenza for at least 18 months in order to avoid the further spread of infection.\n(3) The vaccination programme was approved by Commission Decision 2002/975/EC, of 12 December 2002 introducing vaccination to supplement the measures to control infections with low pathogenic avian influenza in Italy and on specific movement control measures\u00a0(5), which lays down the rules concerning vaccination against avian influenza in a defined geographical area. The Decision also includes specific control measures such as movement restrictions on live poultry, hatching and table eggs for intra-Community trade.\n(4) The results of the vaccination programme reported at several meetings of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health were generally favourable concerning the control of the disease within the vaccination area. However, the infection had spread to some areas adjacent to the established vaccination area. Accordingly, Decision 2002/975/EC, as amended by Decision 2003/436/EC\u00a0(6) extended the vaccination area to cover those adjacent areas.\n(5) Since the end of September 2003, no further circulation of the avian influenza field virus subtype H7N3 has been detected during the intense monitoring carried out in the vaccination area. Consequently Italy requested to introduce some changes to the vaccination programme and the restrictions on intra-Community trade. Accordingly, Decision 2002/975/EC, as amended by Decision 2004/159/EC approved those changes and restrictions.\n(6) In February 2004, a low pathogenic avian influenza virus strain of subtype H5N3 was isolated in one duck flock in the region of Lombardia within the vaccination area. Although the epidemiological investigations have not revealed any spread of the infection, the risk of introduction of avian influenza subtype H5 has been demonstrated. At present neither the poultry vaccinated against H7 subtype within the framework of the existing vaccination campaign nor the non-vaccinated poultry population is protected against disease possibly caused by avian influenza subtype H5. Therefore Italy has requested to amend the current vaccination programme in order to authorise the vaccination of poultry within the established vaccination area with a bivalent vaccine which protects against avian influenza virus infection of both H7 and H5 subtypes and to carry out this kind of vaccination until at least 31 December 2005.\n(7) As Decision 2002/975/EC has already been amended twice, for reasons of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal that Decision and replace it by this Decision.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amended vaccination programme against avian influenza presented by Italy to the Commission is approved and shall be carried out in the vaccination area described in Annex I.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intensive monitoring and surveillance as set out in the vaccination programme referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out in the vaccination area described in Annex I and in the bordering area described in Annex II.", "The restrictions on movements of live poultry, hatching eggs and fresh poultry meat into, out of and within the area described in Annex I shall apply as laid down in the vaccination programme referred to in Article 1 and in the following articles.", "No live poultry and hatching eggs coming from and/or originating from poultry holdings from the area described in Annex I shall be dispatched from Italy.", "Animal health certificates accompanying consignments of live poultry and hatching eggs from Italy shall include the words: \u2018The animal health conditions of this consignment are in accordance with Decision 2004/666/EC\u2019.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fresh meat of poultry shall be marked in accordance with Annex II of Council Directive 2002/99/EC and shall not be dispatched from Italy if it is derived from:\n(a) poultry vaccinated against avian influenza.\n(b) poultry from avian influenza sero-positive poultry flocks destined for slaughter under official control in accordance with the vaccination programme referred to in Article 1.\n(c) poultry originating from holdings located in a restriction zone established in accordance with the provisions laid down in the vaccination programme referred to in Article 1.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1(a) fresh meat derived from turkeys and chickens vaccinated against avian influenza with a heterologous vaccine of subtype (H7N1) and (H5N9) shall not be marked in accordance with Annex II of Council Directive 2002/99/EC and may be dispatched to other Member States, provided that the meat comes from turkeys and chickens which:\n(i) originate from flocks which have been regularly inspected and tested with negative results for avian influenza as laid down in the approved vaccination programme, with particular attention to be paid to the sentinel birds.For the testing of:\n\u2014 vaccinated birds, the iIFA-test shall be used,\n\u2014 sentinel birds, either the Haemagglutination-Inhibition Test (HI), the AGID-test or the ELISA-test shall be used.

vaccinated/non field exposed turkeys and chickens in the framework of a \u2018DIVA\u2019 (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccination strategy using a heterologous subtype vaccine from the field virus subtype.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use of the test for the purpose of dispatching fresh turkey and chicken meat from the vaccination area in Italy to other Member States\nMeat originating from turkey and chicken flocks vaccinated against avian influenza may be dispatched to other Member States provided that, where all the birds are kept in one building, blood samples have been taken by the official veterinarian within seven days prior to slaughter from at least 10 vaccinated turkeys or chickens destined for slaughter. However, where the poultry are kept in more than one group or shed, at least 20 vaccinated birds selected randomly from all the groups or sheds on the farm shall be sampled."}
