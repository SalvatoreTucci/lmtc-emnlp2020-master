Part II of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 contains a list of acceding States which was relevant until 30 April 2004. It is therefore no longer necessary to maintain neither Part II of Annex V nor the separation of Annex V in two parts.\n(5) For the sake of clarity, the country ISO codes should be added in Annex V.\n(6) Serbia has recently requested the authorisation to export hay and straw to the Union.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010\u00a0(3) lists Serbia as a country from which consignments of fresh meat of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and of domestic solipeds may be imported into the Union.\n(8) Although live ungulates from Serbia are not allowed to be introduced into the Union, hay and straw can be allowed for introduction, as the animal health situation in Serbia does not present a risk of spreading infectious or contagious animal diseases through these plant products, which might have been in contact with live animals.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down procedures for veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries (OJ L\u00a021, 28.1.2004, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 of 12 March 2010 laying down lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof authorised for the introduction into the European Union of certain animals and fresh meat and the veterinary certification requirements (OJ L\u00a073, 20.3.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX V\nTHE LIST OF COUNTRIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 9\nISO Code Country\nAU Australia\nBY Belarus\nCA Canada\nCH Switzerland\nCL Chile\nGL Greenland\nIS Iceland\nNZ New Zealand\nRS Serbia\u00a0(1)\nUS United States of America\nZA South Africa (excluding that part of the foot-and-mouth disease control area situated in the veterinary region Northern and Eastern Transvaal, in the district of Ingwavuma of the veterinary region of Natal and in the border area with Botswana east of longitude 28\u00b0)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0As referred to in Article 135 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part (OJ L\u00a0278, 18.10.2013, p.\u00a016).\u2019"}
