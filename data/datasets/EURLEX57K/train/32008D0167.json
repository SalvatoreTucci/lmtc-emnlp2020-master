Due to delay for examination of the requested updated methods, the authorisation should be maintained until this Decision applies.\n(5) Decision 2005/879/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2005/879/EC is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "By way of derogation from the second paragraph of Article 1 of Decision 2005/879/EC, the ZP-DM5 grading method set out in the Annex to that Decision shall continue to be applicable until the notification of the present Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Slovenia."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 301, 20.11.1984, p. 1.

Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by means of the method termed \u201cZwei-Punkt \u2014 DM5 (ZP)\u201d.\n2. The lean meat content of the carcasse shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcasse\nFDM = minimum thickness of visible (back) fat (including rind) on the midline of the split carcasse in millimetres, covering the lumbar muscle (Musculus glutaeus medius)\nMDM = visible thickness of the lumbar muscle on the midline of split carcasse in millimetres, measured as the shortest connection between the front (cranial) end of lumbar muscle and the upper (dorsal) edge of the vertebral canal\nPart 2\nHENNESSY GRADING PROBE (HGP 4)\n1. Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cHennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade on top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO) and photodetector of the type 58 MR and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcasse shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcasse\nFHGP4 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 7 cm off the midline of the carcasse between the third and fourth last rib\nMHGP4 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres measured at the same time and same place as FHGP4"}
