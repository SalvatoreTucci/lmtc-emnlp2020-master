However, the above mentioned study did not identify any stocks consisting of, containing or contaminated with toxaphene in the European Union. In addition, the study demonstrated that, whenever any persistent organic pollutant pesticides were detected in wastes, their concentrations were usually high when compared with the proposed concentration limits. For the time being, the available analytical methodologies for the determination of toxaphene may be considered adequate for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(4) The concentration limit for PCDF/PCDD is expressed in toxic equivalent concentration (\u2018TEQ\u2019), using the 1998 World Health Organisation toxic equivalency factors (\u2018TEFs\u2019). Available data on dioxin-like PCBs are not sufficient to include these compounds in the TEQ.\n(5) Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) is the name of a technical mixture of various isomers. The effort to completely analyse them would be disproportionate. Only alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH is of toxicological relevance. Therefore, the concentration limit exclusively refers to them. Most commercially available analytical standard mixtures for the analysis of this compound class only identify these isomers.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The Committee provided for in Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 has not delivered an opinion on the measures laid down in this Regulation, following its consultation, on 25 January 2006, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17(2) of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 shall be replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
