There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced into the Community via international trade in live poultry, live birds other than poultry and certain products thereof.\n(2) Following the outbreak of avian influenza, caused by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strain, in south-eastern Asia starting in December 2003, the Commission adopted several protection measures in relation to avian influenza. Those measures included, in particular, Commission Decision 2005/710/EC of 13 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Romania\u00a0(3), Commission Decision 2005/733/EC of 19 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Turkey and repealing Decision 2005/705/EC\u00a0(4) and Commission Decision 2005/758/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Croatia and repealing Decision 2005/749/EC\u00a0(5).\n(3) Since Decisions 2005/710/EC, 2005/733/EC and 2005/758/EC were adopted, new cases of avian influenza have been confirmed several times during surveillance in Romania, Turkey and Croatia. Accordingly, the restrictions contained in those Decisions concerning those countries should be continued by extending their period of application to 31 July 2006.\n(4) Decisions 2005/710/EC, 2005/733/EC and 2005/758/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 4 of Decision 2005/710/EC, the date \u201830 April 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 July 2006\u2019.", "In Article 6 of Decision 2005/733/EC, the date \u201830 April 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 July 2006\u2019.", "In Article 5 of Decision 2005/758/EC, the date \u201830 April 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 July 2006\u2019.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
