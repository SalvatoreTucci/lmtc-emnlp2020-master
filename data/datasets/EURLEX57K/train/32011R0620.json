Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should be amended in order to bring it into conformity with the international obligations of the European Union under the GATT 1994. The required amendments are in accordance with Council Decision 97/359/EC of 24 March 1997 concerning the elimination of duties on information technology products\u00a0(3), which approved the ITA.\n(2) Following the WTO Panel Report, digital copying should not constitute photocopying under the GATT 1994 and copying speed should not be the sole classification criterion. Subheading 8443\u00a031 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 and the corresponding duty rate should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) The wording of subheading 8528\u00a071\u00a015 of the CN (previously 8528\u00a071\u00a013) should be amended in order to include set-top boxes which, besides the function of communication, may be capable of performing the additional functions of recording or reproducing, provided that, as a result, they do not lose the essential character of a set-top box which has a communication function.\n(4) This regulation should enter into force on 1 July 2011 at the end of the reasonable period of time agreed by the European Union with the complaining parties for the European Union to bring itself into conformity with its WTO obligations.\n(5) As recommendations in reports adopted by the WTO\u2019s Dispute Settlement Body only have prospective effect, this regulation should not have retroactive effects nor provide interpretative guidance on a retroactive basis. Since it cannot operate to provide interpretative guidance for classification of goods which have been released for free circulation prior to 1 July 2011 it should not serve as a basis for the reimbursement of any duties paid prior to that date.\n(6) The Customs Code Committee has not issued an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Part Two, Section XVI of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2011.\nIt shall have neither retroactive effect nor provide interpretative guidance on a retroactive basis.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2011.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0WT/DS375/R, WT/DS376/R, WT/DS377/R.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 12.6.1997, p. 1.\nANNEX\nPart Two, Section XVI of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is amended as follows:\n(1) Chapter 84 is amended as follows:\n(a) the row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a010 is deleted;\n(b) between the row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a010 and the row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a091\u2018\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Other\u2019 is deleted;\n(c) the following row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a020 is inserted:\n\u20188443\u00a031\u00a020 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Machines having digital copying as principal function, where the copying is performed by scanning the original and printing the copies by means of an electrostatic print engine \u2026 2,2\u00a0% p/st\u2019\n(d) the following row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a080 is inserted:\n\u20188443\u00a031\u00a080 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Other \u2026 Free p/st\u2019\n(e) the row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a091 is deleted;\n(f) the row for CN code 8443\u00a031\u00a099 is deleted;\n(2) Chapter 85 is amended as follows:\n(a) the row for CN code 8528\u00a071\u00a013 is deleted;\n(b) the following row for CN code 8528\u00a071\u00a015 is inserted:\n\u20188528\u00a071\u00a015 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Apparatus with a microprocessor-based device incorporating a modem for gaining access to the Internet, and having a function of interactive information exchange, capable of receiving television signals (so-called \u201cset-top boxes which have a communication function\u201d, including those incorporating a device performing a recording or reproducing function, provided that they retain the essential character of a set-top box which has a communication function) \u2026 Free p/st\u2019\n(c) the row for CN code 8528\u00a071\u00a090 is deleted;\n(d) the following rows are inserted after CN code 8528\u00a071\u00a019:\n\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Other:\n\u20188528\u00a071\u00a091 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Apparatus with a microprocessor-based device incorporating a modem for gaining access to the Internet, and having a function of interactive information exchange, capable of receiving television signals (so-called \u201cset-top boxes which have a communication function\u201d, including those incorporating a device performing a recording or reproducing function, provided that they retain the essential character of a set-top box which has a communication function) \u2026 Free p/st\n8528\u00a071\u00a099 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Other \u2026 14 p/st\u2019"}
