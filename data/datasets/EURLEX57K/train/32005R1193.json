That list includes countries and territories which are free of rabies and countries in respect of which the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements from their territories has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States.\n(3) From information supplied by Argentina it appears that the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements of pet animals from Argentina has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States or from third countries already listed in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. Therefore Argentina should be included in the list of countries and territories set out in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003.\n(4) In the interest of clarity that list of countries and territories should be replaced in its entirety.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.
