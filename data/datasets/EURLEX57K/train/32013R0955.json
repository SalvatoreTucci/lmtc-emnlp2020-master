That list includes propiconazole.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, propiconazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 9, fibre, leather, rubber and polymerised materials preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 9 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Finland was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 11 February 2011 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 12 July 2013, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from the assessment report that biocidal products used for product-type 9 and containing propiconazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve propiconazole for use in biocidal products for product-type 9.\n(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Propiconazole shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 9, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1.\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nPropiconazole 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole 930\u00a0g/kg 1 June 2015 31 May 2025 9 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The purity indicated in this column was the minimum degree of purity of the active substance used for the evaluation made in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
