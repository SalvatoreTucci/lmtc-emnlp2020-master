Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 653/94, the Republics of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia and the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should benefit from preferential tariff arrangements, in particular  where subject to tariff ceilings; whereas Article 1 (4) provides that once the ceilings are reached the Commission may adopt a regulation to re-establish the levying of customs duties actually applied vis-\u00e0-vis third countries until the end of the  calendar year;\nWhereas imports of the products specified in the Annex to this Regulation originating in the said Republics and eligible for tariff preferences have been charged against the ceiling up to the total amount; whereas the situation on the Community market  for these products requires the re-establishment of customs duties vis-\u00e0-vis the Republics in question;\nWhereas the levying of customs duties for these products should therefore be re-established,", "main_body": ["From 17
