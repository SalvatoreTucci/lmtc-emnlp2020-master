Commission experts inspected the irradiation facilities in order to check whether they comply with the requirements of Directive 1999/2/EC and in particular if official supervision guarantees that they comply with the requirements of Article 7 of that Directive. Competent authorities of both countries provided satisfactory responses to all the recommendations contained in the final report.\n(4) Since the accession from Hungary to the Community on 1 May 2004, it is no longer appropriate to list the irradiation facility of that Member State in the Annex to Decision 2002/840/EC. This facility will be added to the list of approved irradiation facilities in the Member States referred to in Article 7(4) of Directive 1999/2/EC.\n(5) Decision 2002/840/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2002/840/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 66, 13.3.1999, p. 16.
