If these quotations are not representative, fob quotations available in the United States of America are used instead. In the summer months, the Commission normally uses the fob quotations for barley in Duluth (Great Lakes). In the wintertime, however, and due to the Great Lakes freeze over, other fob quotations are normally used (Gulf or Portland).\n(2) The second footnote of annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 stipulates that an amount corresponding to the freight cost, from the place of the quotation to the Gulf of Mexico, must be taken into account. As a result of using of the fob quotation in Portland, some distortions have occurred in the calculation of the representative cif import price for barley. As the barley-producing areas are situated in the north-central States of the United States of America, the distances to be covered and, in consequence, the freight costs from the production areas to the export ports are all similar. The requirement to take account of the freight costs between the selected port of fob quotation and the Gulf of Mexico should therefore be removed.\n(3) Consequently, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 must be amended.\n(4) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The second footnote in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 is replaced by the following: \"Where no quotation is available that can be used to calculate a representative cif import price, the most representative fob quotations publicly available in the United States of America shall be used.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 161, 29.6.1996, p. 125.\n(4) OJ L 91, 6.4.2002, p. 9."}
