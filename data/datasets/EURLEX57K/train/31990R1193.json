whereas those conditions are likely to ensure  that\nsuch organizations contribute, in particular by improving\ntheir efficiency, towards  re-establishing balance between production and demand on the market; whereas, to\nthat end, those  conditions must include in particular\ntotal concentration of supply and adequate regulation of  production and of placing on the market and the necessary provisions to ensure that such  organizations provide proof\nof sufficient economic activity; whereas, with a view to\nthat  objective, such organizations must be required to incorporate in their rules of association precise  clauses guaranteeing producers control of decisions and the operation of the organization and  clauses penalizing infringements of the rules laid down; whereas recognized producers'  organizations should be given a period to adapt to the new provisions; whereas it should therefore  be specified that the Member States should verify compliance of the producers' organizations with  the overall provisions applicable to them;\nWhereas experience has shown that citrus fruit withdrawn from the market is normally not disposed  of in accordance with the facilities provided for in Article 21 of Regulation\n(EEC) No  1035/72; whereas the citrus fruit harvest is staggered over the marketing year; whereas provision  should be made for a structure to enable producers' organizations to plan, rationalize and check  withdrawal operations where the production and market situations so require and to improve the  conditions under which recourse is had to the possibilities of free disposal;\nWhereas Article 15a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 provides that preventive withdrawals of  apples and pears may be authorized under certain conditions; whereas paragraphs 3 and 4 of that  Article provide that those arrangements are to apply until 30 June 1990; whereas the Commission  will forward to the Council before that date a report on the way those arrangements function;  whereas such a report has been drawn up; whereas it shows that the arrangements have beneficial  effects on the marketing years for the products concerned; whereas those arrangements should  therefore be made permanent;\nWhereas, pursuant to Articles 16 (4), 18 (1) and 19 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, the prices  at which products are bought in under Articles 19 and 19a and the financial compensation paid under  Article 18 of that Regulation are to be calculated on the basis of the buying-in price multiplied  by conversion factors;\nWhereas producers must be encouraged to deliver their surplus products for processing;\nWhereas the differences in upgrading of the product as a result of the application of the  conversion factors were established for the needs of the market for products consumed fresh and are  not relevant for processing;\nWhereas there should no longer be varying withdrawal prices for lemons according to size or form of  packaging and provision should be made for the withdrawal price of such products to be that of  products of mixed sizings, in bulk in a means of transport;\nWhereas withdrawals of citrus fruit in certain regions and in particular of mandarins and lemons  have already attained a very high percentage of the marketable production of the members of certain  producers' organizations; whereas the withdrawal system is only an exceptional instrument for  monitoring the market and does not in itself constitute a method of disposal; whereas the financial  compensation paid in respect of such withdrawals should be limited where it appears that a  producers' organization has not fulfilled its basic objective of marketing the production of its  members; whereas such a measure should be applied progressively in order to permit producers'  organizations experiencing operating problems to adapt to it;\nWhereas Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 1035/72 provides that certain classes of blood oranges,  withdrawn from the market under Articles 15b and 18 thereof or bought in in accordance with  Articles 19 and 19a thereof, may be disposed of to the processing industry under certain  conditions; whereas that possibility has not been made use of since the 1979/80 marketing year;  whereas the provisions of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2601/69 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0  1123/89 (2), are better suited to encouraging the processing of such blood oranges; whereas the  former provision should be amended;\nWhereas, in order to improve the conditions under which recourse is had to possibilities of free  disposal provided for in Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 1035/72, on the one hand provision  should be made for the possibility of the Community's defraying the costs of sorting and packaging  the products in question and on the other hand\nthe Member States should be encouraged to organize  contacts between producers' organizations and establishments or charitable organizations; whereas  in view of the characteristics of the harvest and of marketing and of the level of withdrawals of  apples and citrus fruit, those provisions should apply only to those products,", "main_body": ["Title I of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
