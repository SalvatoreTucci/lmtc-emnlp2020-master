When animals under transhumance are moved on foot from one pasture to another, they will pass through and graze on conventional land, both on the way in and out of the areas of transhumance and between the different transhumance grazing pastures.\n(4) There is a need to ensure that transhumance for organic livestock can continue, notwithstanding the fact that the animals will take up a certain amount of conventional roughage.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["In Part B of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 the following point 4.10 is inserted:\n\u20184.10.

The uptake of conventional feed, in the form of grass and other vegetation on which the animals graze, during this period shall not exceed 10\u00a0% of the total feed ration per year.
