However, the new Appendix does not contain the non-exhaustive list of large-fruited varieties of Prunus salicina it included before the amendment, following the recommendation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to distinguish between varieties of Prunus domestica and those of Prunus salicina. In the interest of transparency on the world market, that list should be re-established.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1168/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The Appendix to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1168/1999 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.
