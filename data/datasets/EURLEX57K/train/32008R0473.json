It is therefore necessary to adjust that Annex. In view of the number of changes to be made, it is appropriate for reasons of clarity to replace that Annex in its entirety.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) Since Regulation (EC) No\u00a01214/2007 entered into force on 1 January 2008, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 244, 29.9.2000, p. 1.
