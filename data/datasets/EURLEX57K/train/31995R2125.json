whereas these quotas should therefore be opened and  conditions laid down for their administration, while ensuring that the transition between the  system expiring on 30 June 1995 and the new system applicable from 1 July 1995 is as smooth as  possible; whereas for this purpose the detailed rules of application of the old system should be  carried over and the traditional import calendars should be maintained;\nWhereas the import licences issued from 1 January to 30 June 1995 pursuant to Commission Regulation  (EC) No 3107/94  (4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1032/95  (5), covered all the annual  quantity available for China, 10  056 tonnes for Poland, 137 tonnes for Bulgaria, and 551 tonnes  for all the other supplier countries; whereas no licences were issued for Romania; whereas quotas  should therefore be opened for the period 1 July to 31 December 1995 corresponding to the balances  available for each of the abovementioned countries or groups of countries;\nWhereas the quantity to be imported should be allocated between the supplier countries, account  being taken of traditional patterns of trade, of new suppliers and of preferences as provided for  in the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria  (6), Poland  (7) and Romania  (8);\nWhereas provision should be made to review the allocation during a given year on the basis of the  data available after the first six months of use; whereas a reserve should be established so as to  avoid any interruption in trade with a supplier country when the overall quantity has not been  exhausted;\nWhereas detailed arrangements should be laid down to ensure that the quantities in excess of the  tariff quotas are subjected to the levying of the full duty provided for in the Common Customs  Tariff; whereas those arrangements must involve the issuing of licences at the end of a period in  which the quantities are checked and the necessary notifications are made by the Member States;  whereas these provisions are either supplementary to or derogate from the provisions of Commission  Regulation (EC) No 1921/95 of 3 August 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of the  system of import licences for products processed from fruit and vegetables and repealing  Regulations (EEC) No 2405/89 and (EEC) No 3518/86  (9), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88  of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import  and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products  (10), as last  amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95  (11);\nWhereas a distinction should be drawn between traditional importers and new importers and certain  criteria relating to the status of the applicants and the use of the licences allocated should be  laid down; whereas, lastly, the quantities for each category of importer should be allocated  fairly;\nWhereas it is more appropriate to establish henceforth an allocation between traditional importers  on the basis of the quantities imported rather than on the basis of the licences issued; whereas,  for administrative reasons, provision should nevertheless be made to retain the transitional period  provided for in Regulation (EC) No 3107/94;\nWhereas, to ensure the correct use of the quotas, provision must be made for regular notification  by the Member States of the quantities for which licences have not been used;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables and the Customs Code  Committee,", "main_body": ["Tariff quotas for preserved mushrooms of the genus Agaricus falling  within CN codes 0711  90  40, 2003  10  20 and 2003  10  30, shown in Annex I, shall be opened  subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.\nThe rate of duty applicable shall be 12  % ad valorem in the case of products falling within CN  code 0711  90  40 and 23  % in the case of products falling within CN codes 2003  10  20 and 2003   10  30.
