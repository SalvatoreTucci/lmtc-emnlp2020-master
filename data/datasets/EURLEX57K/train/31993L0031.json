DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n1.1. 'stand' means a device that is firmly attached to the vehicle and is able to maintain the vehicle in its vertical (or almost vertical) parking position when left unattended by its driver;\n1.2. 'prop stand' means a stand which, when extended or swung into the open position, supports the vehicle on one side only, while leaving both wheels in contact with the supporting surface;\n1.3. 'centre stand' means a stand which, when swung into the open position supports the vehicle by providing one or several areas of contact between the vehicle and the supporting surface either side of the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle;\n1.4. 'transverse tilt (tt)' means the gradient, expressed as a percentage, of the actual supporting surface, the intersection of the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and the supporting surface being perpendicular to the line of maximum gradient  (figure 1);\n1.5. 'longitudinal tilt (lt)' means the gradient, expressed as a percentage, of the actual supporting surface, the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle being parallel to the line of maximum gradient (figure 2);\n1.6. 'median longitudinal plane of the vehicle' means the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the rear wheel of the vehicle.\n2. GENERAL\n2.1. All two-wheel vehicles shall be fitted with at least one stand in order to keep them steady when stationary (e.g. when parked) but not held in a static position by a person or external means. Twin-wheel vehicles need not be fitted with stands but  must meet the requirements set out in 6.2.2 when in a parking position (parking brake applied).\n2.2. The stand must be of either a prop or a centre type, or both.\n2.3. Where the stand swivels about the lower part of or below the vehicle the outer edge(s) of that stand must swing to the rear of the vehicle in order to attain the closed or travelling position.\n3. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\n3.1. Prop stands\n3.1.1. Prop stands must:\n3.1.1.1. be able to support the vehicle in such a way as to provide its lateral stability whether the vehicle is on a horizontal supporting surface or on a slope in order to prevent its leaning further too easily (and in so doing does not rotate about  the point of support provided by the prop stand) or is moved too easily into a vertical position and beyond (and in so doing does not swing over to the side opposite the prop stand);\n3.1.1.2. be able to support the vehicle in such a way as to maintain stability when the vehicle is parked on a slope in accordance with section 6.2.2;\n3.1.1.3. be able to swing back automatically into the retracted or travelling position:\n3.1.1.3.1. when the vehicle returns to its normal (vertical) driving position; or\n3.1.1.3.2. when the vehicle moves forward as a result of deliberate action by the driver following the first contact of the prop stand with the ground;\n3.1.1.4. notwithstanding the requirements set out in section 3.1.1.3, be designed and constructed in such a way that they do not close automatically if the angle of lean is altered unexpectedly (for example, if the vehicle is pushed lightly by a third  party or by a gust of wind arising from the passage of a vehicle):\n3.1.1.4.1. once in the extended or parking position;\n3.1.1.4.2. the vehicle being leaned in order to bring the outer extremity of the prop stand into contact with the ground;\n3.1.1.4.3. the vehicle being left unattended in its parking position.\n3.1.2. The requirements set out in section 3.1.1.3 do not apply if the vehicle is designed in such a way that it cannot be propelled by its engine when the prop stand is extended.\n3.2. Centre stands\n3.2.1. Centre stands must:\n3.2.1.1. be able to support the vehicle with either one or both wheels in contact with the supporting surface or without any of the wheels being in contact with that surface in such a way as to confer stability on that vehicle:\n3.2.1.1.1. on a horizontal supporting surface;\n3.2.1.1.2. in a leaning position;\n3.2.1.1.3. on a slope in accordance with section 6.2.2;\n3.2.1.2. be able to fold backwards automatically into its retracted or travelling position:\n3.2.1.2.1. when the vehicle moves forward in such a way as to raise the centre stand from the supporting surface.\n3.2.2. The requirements set out in section 3.2.1.2 do not apply if the vehicle is designed in such a way that it cannot be propelled by its engine when the centre stand is extended.\n4. OTHER REQUIREMENTS\n4.1. Moreover, vehicles may be fitted with a tell-tale that is clearly visible to the rider when seated in the driving position and which, when the ignition is switched on, lights up and remains so until the stand is in its retracted or travelling  position.\n4.2. All stands shall be provided with a retention system which holds them in the retracted or travelling position. That system may consist of either:\n- two independent devices such as two separate springs or one spring and one retaining device such as a clip,\nor\n- a single device which must be able to operate without failing for at least\n- 10 000 normal-use cycles if the vehicle has been fitted with two stands,\nor\n- 15 000 normal-use cycles if the vehicle is fitted with only one stand.\n5. STABILITY TESTS\n5.1. The following tests must be carried out in order to determine the capacity for holding the vehicle in a stable condition as specified in sections 3 and 4:\n5.2. State of the vehicle\n5.2.1. The vehicle must be submitted at its kerb mass.\n5.2.2. The tyres must be inflated to a pressure recommended by their manufacturer for that state.\n5.2.3. The transmission must be in neutral or, in the case of an automatic transmission, in the 'parking' position where such exists.\n5.2.4. If the vehicle is fitted with a parking brake, it must be applied.\n5.2.5. The steering shall be locked in position. If the steering is able to be locked when it is turned to either the left or the right the tests must be carried out in both positions.\n5.3. Test pad\n5.3.1. A flat, horizontal pad having a hard surface that is dry and free from grains of sand may be used for the tests referred to in section 6.1.\n5.4. Test equipment\n5.4.1. A parking platform must be used for the tests referred to in section 6.2.\n5.4.2. The parking platform must have a rigid, flat, rectangular surface which is able to support the vehicle without perceptible flexing.\n5.4.3. The surface of the parking platform must possess sufficient anti-skid properties to prevent the vehicle from sliding across the supporting surface during the tilt or lean tests.\n5.4.4. The parking platform shall be designed in such a way as to be able to assume at least the transverse tilt (TT) and the longitudinal tilt (LT) required by section 6.2.2.\n6. TEST PROCEDURES\n6.1. Stability on a horizontal supporting surface (test for section 3.1.1.4).\n6.1.1. With the vehicle on the test pad the prop stand is extended or moved into the parking position and the vehicle is brought to rest upon it.\n6.1.2. The vehicle is moved in order to increase by three degrees the angle formed by the median longitudinal plane and the supporting surface (by moving the vehicle towards the vertical).\n6.1.3. This movement must not cause the prop stand to return automatically to its retracted or travelling position.\n6.2. Stability on an inclined surface (tests associated with sections 3.1.1.1, 3.1.1.2, 3.2.1.1.2, 3.2.1.1.3).\n6.2.1. The vehicle is placed on the parking platform with the prop stand and, separately, the centre stand in the extended or parking position and the vehicle is allowed to rest on the stand.\n6.2.2. The parking platform is shifted to its minimum transverse tilt (TT) and then to its minimum longitudinal tilt (LT) in accordance with the following table:\nSee figures 1a, 1b and 2 below.\n6.2.3. Where a vehicle on an tilted parking platform rests on the centre stand and just one wheel and may be maintained in that position with the centre stand and either the front or the rear wheel in contact with the supporting surface, the tests  described above must be conducted solely with the vehicle resting on the centre stand and rear wheel provided that the other requirements set out in this section are met.\n6.2.4. The vehicle must remain stable when the parking platform is tilted by each of the required amounts and the above requirements have duly been met.\n6.2.5. Alternatively the parking platform may be tilted by the required amounts before the vehicle is moved into position.\nAppendix 1  Information document in respect of stands for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle\n(to be attached to the application for component type-approval where this is submitted independently of the application for vehicle type-approval)\nOrder No (assigned by the applicant): .\nThe application for component type-approval in respect of stands for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle must contain the information set out under the following points in Annex II to Council Directive 92/61/EEC\n- Part A, sections:\n- 0.1\n- 0.2\n- 0.4 to 0.6\n- 2.1\n- 2.1.1;\n- Part B, sections:\n- 1.3.1.\nAppendix 2  Name of administration\nComponent type-approval certificate in respect of stands for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle\nMODEL\nReport No . by technical service . date .\nComponent type-approval No: .
