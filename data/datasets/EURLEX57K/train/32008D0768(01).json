In cases where a longer advance notice period is provided, such period can be shortened to expire at the end of the growing season.\n(6) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for these active substances according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The active substances listed in Annex I to this Decision shall not be included as active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.", "Member States shall ensure that:\n(a) authorisations for plant protection products containing the active substances listed in Annex I are withdrawn by 30 March 2009;\n(b) no authorisations for plant protection products containing these active substances are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.", "Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire not later than 30 March 2010.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 September 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0168, 27.6.2002, p.\u00a014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0379, 24.12.2004, p.\u00a013."}
