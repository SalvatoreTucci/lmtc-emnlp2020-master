Food business operators are required to comply with the requirements set out in Annex II thereto.\n(2) Experience gained since the date of application of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004 has exposed certain difficulties as regards the storage of food of animal origin. If the date of initial freezing of such food was indicated, food business operators would be better able to judge the suitability of the food for human consumption.\n(3) Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs\u00a0(2) concerns the labelling of foodstuffs to be delivered as such to the final consumer and certain aspects relating to the presentation and advertising thereof. However, that Directive does not apply to prior stages of food production.\n(4) In addition, the enforcement of compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004 by the competent authorities has revealed that more detailed requirements regarding the production and freezing of food of animal origin in the stages of production prior to its delivery as such to the final consumer are necessary.\n(5) Accordingly, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004 should be amended in order to include requirements applicable to frozen food of animal origin.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.\nANNEX\nThe following Section IV is added to Annex II to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0853/2004:\n\u2018SECTION IV:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FROZEN FOOD OF ANIMAL ORIGIN\n1.

Until the stage at which a food is labelled in accordance with Directive 2000/13/EC or used for further processing, food business operators must ensure that in the case of frozen food of animal origin intended for human consumption, the following information is made available to the food business operator to whom the food is supplied and, upon request, to the competent authority:\n(a) the date of production; and\n(b) the date of freezing, if different from the date of production.\n3. The appropriate form in which the information must be made available is up to the choice of the supplier of the frozen food, as long as the information requested in paragraph 2 will be clearly and unequivocally available to and retrievable by the business operator to whom the food is supplied.\u2019"}
