whereas a satisfactory level of information on the trading of goods between Member States must therefore be ensured by means other than those involving checks, even indirect ones, at internal frontiers;\nWhereas it will consequently be necessary to collect directly from consignors and consignees the data necessary to compile statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, using methods and techniques which will ensure that they are exhaustive, reliable and up-to-date, without giving rise for the parties concerned, in particular for small and medium-sized businesses, to a burden out of proportion to the results which users of the said statistics can reasonably expect;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 of 7 November 1991 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (5) provides that the conditions should be created for increased use of automatic data processing and electronic data transmission for the purpose of facilitating the task of the parties responsible for providing information;\nWhereas it is necessary to ease the burden which statistical returns place on businesses, while at the same time improving the circulation of statistical information with a view to the creation of the European information market;\nWhereas the compilation of harmonized statistics, in particular with a link between statistics on trade and other economic statistics, should be ensured in order to contribute to market transparency and to the evaluation of the competitiveness of businesses;\nWhereas the promotion of the use of harmonized standards and concepts at European level will ultimately lead to the elimination of duplication and to economies of scale, while facilitating the emergence of new services in the field of statistical telematics;\nWhereas standardization carried out at international level in the sphere of electronic data interchange (EDI) contributes to facilitating international trade and to simplifying relations between undertakings and administrative authorities;\nWhereas the establishment of common statistical standards for the production of harmonized information is an activity which can be carried out effectively only at Community level, in collaboration with the Member States; whereas such standards will be implemented in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of official statistics;\nWhereas the measures aimed at ensuring the interoperability of telematic networks between administrations fall within the framework of priorities adopted in relation to the guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks;\nWhereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995, is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budget authority as they are defined by the Treaty;\nWhereas by its judgment of 26 March 1996 the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 94/445/EC of 11 July 1994 on inter-administration telematic networks for statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (Edicom) (6) on the grounds of an inappropriate legal basis; whereas a new decision should therefore be adopted on an appropriate legal basis to enable Edicom measures to continue,", "main_body": ["A set of measures, hereinafter referred to as 'Edicom` (electronic data interchange on commerce), shall be implemented to facilitate the conversion of regional, national and Community systems towards interoperable systems at European level, as a first stage, for the collection of returns on the trading of goods between Member States from businesses, the validation and pre-processing of such returns and the dissemination of the statistics derived therefrom.\nThese systems shall be based on distributed information systems at regional, national and Community levels, the interoperability of which shall be guaranteed by the development and use of harmonized standards and communication procedures.\nThese systems shall be based in particular on the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) for the transmission of statistical returns.
