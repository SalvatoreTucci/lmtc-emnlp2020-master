After centrifuging, ferric ammonium citrate and ammonia are added to an aliquot part of the supernatant and the absorbance of the solution thus obtained is measured spectrometrically at 525 nm.  //   // The tannin content is determined using a calibration curve prepared from tannic acid.  // 2.  // OBJECTIVE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION  //   // This global method of determing tannins applies to sorghum grains.  // 3.  // APPARATUS  //   // Normal laboratory equipment, in particular:  // 3.1.  // Mechanical crusher making it possible to obtain particles which pass completely through the sieve (3.2);  // 3.2.  // Sieve with a 1 mm mesh;  // 3.3.  // Centrifuge making it possible to attain a centrifugal acceleration of 3 000 g (3 000 \u00d7 9,81 m/s-2);  // 3.4.  // Centrifuge tubes with a capacity of about 50 ml, hermetically stoppered;  // 3.5.  // Mechanical stirrer with a reciprocating motion or magnetic stirrer;  // 3.6.  // Vortex stirrer;  // 3.7.  // Spectrometer with cells 10 mm thick, permitting measurements at 525 nm;  // 3.8.  // Pipettes, 1 ml, 5 ml and 20 ml, class A;  // 3.9.  // Graduated pipettes, 5 ml and 10 ml, class A;  // 3.10.  // Test tubes, 140 \u00d7 14 mm;  // 3.11.  // Volumetric flasks, 100 ml;  // 3.12.  // Analytical balance.  // 4.  // REAGENTS  //   // All the reagents used must be of analytical quality. The water used must be distilled water or of at least equivalent purity.  // 4.1.  // Tannic acid solution 2 grams per litre  //  // Since the origin of the tannic acid has a definite influence on the calibration curve, the use of Merck reference 773 tannic acid is recommended in order to permit inter-laboratory comparisons.  //   // This solution can be kept for one week.  // 4.2.  // Ammonia solution 8,0 grams per litre of NH3.  // 4.3.  // Dimethylformamide solution 75 % v/v  //   // Introduce 75 ml of dimethylformamide into a 100-ml volumetric flask. Dilute with water, allow to cool and make up to the mark.  // 4.4.  // Ferric ammonium citrate (28 % iron) solution 3,5 grams per litre, prepared 24 hours before use.  // 5.  // METHOD  // 5.1.  // Preparation of the test sample  //   // Remove any matter other than sorghum from the laboratory sample and crush the sample in the mechanical crusher (3.1) so as to reduce it to particles which pass completely through a 1-mm sieve (3.2). Homogenize well.  // 5.2.  // Water content of the test sample  //  // Determine the water content of the test sample.  // 5.3.  // Test portion  //   // Introduce about 1 g of test sample (5.1) weighed to the nearest 1 mg into a centrifuge tube (3.4).  // 5.4.  // Determination  // 5.4.1.  // Pipette 20 ml of the dimethylformamide solution (4.3) into the centrifuge tube. Stopper the tube hermetically and shake it for 60 \u00b1 1 minutes on the stirrer (3.5). Then centrifuge for 10 minutes with an acceleration of 3 000 g.  // 5.4.2.  // Remove 1 ml of the supernatant liquid (5.4.1) with a pipette (3.8) and introduce it into a test tube (3.10). Successively add 6 ml of water and 1 ml of the ammonia solution (4.2) by pipetting, and then shake for a few seconds on the stirrer (3.6).  // 5.4.3.  // Remove 1 ml of the supernatant liquid (5.4.1) with a pipette (3.8) and introduce it into a test tube (3.10). Successively add 5 ml of water and 1 ml of the ferric ammonium citrate solution (4.4) by pipetting, shake for a few seconds on the stirrer (3.6), then add 1 ml of the ammonia solution (4.2) by pipetting and shake again for a few seconds on the stirrer (3.6).  // 5.4.4.  // Transfer the solutions obtained in 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 measuring cells and measure the absorbances by spectrometer (3.7) at 525 mm against the water blank 10 \u00b1 1 minutes after the end of the operations in 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. The result is the difference between the two absorbances.  // 5.5.  // Number of determinations  //   // Perform two determinations on test portions from the same test sample.  // 5.6.  // Establishment of the calibration curve  //  // Warning: The calibration scale must be obtained again every day.  // 5.6.1.  // Prepare six 20-ml volumetric flasks (3.11) and pipette into them respectively 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ml of the tannic acid solution (4.1). Make up to the mark with the dimethylformamide solution (4.3). The calibration scale thus obtained is 0, 0,1, 0,2, 0,3, 0,4 and 0,5 mg/ml.  // 5.6.2.  // Pipette into test tubes (3.10) 1 ml of each of these solutions and add, by pipetting, successively 5 ml of water and 1 ml of ferric ammonium citrate solution (4.4), shake for a few seconds on the stirrer (3.6), then add 1 ml of ammonia solution (4.2) and shake again for a few seconds on the stirrer (3.6).  //   // Transfer the solutions thus obtained to measuring cells and after 10 \u00b1 1 minutes measure the absorbances on the spectrometer at 525 nm against the water blank.  // 5.6.3.  // Plot the calibration curve, using the absorbance values as the ordinate and the corresponding concentrations of tannic acid on the calibration scale (5.6.1) as the abscissa, in milligrams per millilitre.  //   // Note: This line should not pass through the origin and should not be corrected for the zero of the scale.  // 6.  // EXPRESSION OF RESULTS  //  // The tannin content, expressed as a percentage by mass of tannic acid in relation to the dry matter, is equal to:\n1.2.3.4 //   // 2C m  // \u00d7  // 100 100 - H\nwhere:\n1.2.3 //   // C =  // the tannic acid concentration, in milligrams per millilitre, of the test solution, read from the calibration curve (5.6.3),  //   // m =  // the mass, in grams, of the test portion (5.3);  //   // H =  // the water content of the test sample, as a percentage by mass (5.2).'"}
