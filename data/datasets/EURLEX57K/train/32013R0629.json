The Union price is now stable at a level of around EUR 700/tonne, which is the highest level reached since the reform of the sugar market organisation and disturbs the optimal fluidity of the sugar supply on the Union market. The expected increase of this already high price level at the beginning of the 2012/13 marketing year substantiated the risk of serious market disturbances which had to be prevented by the necessary measures. On 18 January, 15 February and 22 March 2013 the Commission adopted Implementing Regulations (EU) No 36/2013\u00a0(2), (EU) No 131/2013\u00a0(3) and (EU) No 281/2013\u00a0(4) providing exceptional measures intended to address the market disturbance. Notwithstanding the measures taken, the current prices registered on the market show that it is necessary to adopt further measures to address the persisting market disturbance.\n(2) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/13, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 500\u00a0000 tonnes than in 2011/12. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.\n(3) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 4\u00a0600\u00a0000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/13 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 1\u00a0200\u00a0000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.\n(4) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/13.\n(5) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.\n(6) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota\u00a0(5) has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.\n(7) For a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, a reduced surplus levy should be fixed at a level per tonne allowing for a fair treatment of Union sugar producers, ensuring the good functioning of the Union sugar market and helping to reduce the difference between Union and world market sugar prices without creating risks of accumulation of surpluses in the Union market.\n(8) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar.\n(9) With a view to increasing the supply, sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market with a reduced surplus levy.\n(10) The reduced surplus levy should be paid after the application is admitted and before the certificate is issued.\n(11) The validity of the certificates should be limited in time to encourage a fast improvement of the supply situation.\n(12) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant\u2019s own production should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.\n(13) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply. The minimum eligibility requirements for applications should be specified.\n(14) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received. In order to simplify and standardise those notifications, models should be made available.\n(15) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.\n(16) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether the quantity applied for was fully or partially granted.\n(17) The competent authorities should notify the Commission of the quantities for which certificates with a reduction of the surplus levy have been issued. For this purpose, models should be made available by the Commission.\n(18) Sugar quantities released on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates issued under this Regulation should be subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne. This consistent approach is aimed at preventing abuse of the mechanism introduced by this Regulation.\n(19) For the purpose of establishing average prices for quota and out-of-quota sugar on the Union market in accordance with Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system\u00a0(6), sugar covered by a certificate issued pursuant to this Regulation should be considered as quota sugar.\n(20) In accordance with Article 2(1)(a) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities\u2019 own resources\u00a0(7) contributions and other duties provided for within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are to constitute own resources. It is therefore necessary to set the date of establishment of the amounts in question within the meaning of Article 2(2) and Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the Communities\u2019 own resources\u00a0(8).\n(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Temporary reduction of the surplus levy\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006, the amount of the surplus levy for a maximum quantity of 150\u00a0000 tonnes of sugar in white sugar equivalent and 8\u00a0000 tonnes of isoglucose in dry matter, produced in excess of the quota fixed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and released on the Union market in the 2012/13 marketing year, shall be fixed at EUR 148 per tonne.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reduced surplus levy provided for in paragraph 1 shall be paid after the application referred to in Article 2 is admitted and before the certificate referred to in Article 6 is issued.", "Application for certificates\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to benefit from the conditions specified in Article 1, sugar and isoglucose producers shall apply for a certificate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicants may be only undertakings producing beet and cane sugar or isoglucose, which are approved in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and have been allocated a production quota for the 2012/13 marketing year, in accordance with Article 56 of that Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each applicant may submit not more than one application for sugar and one for isoglucose per application period.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for certificates shall be submitted by fax or electronic mail to the competent authority in the Member State in which the undertaking was approved.
