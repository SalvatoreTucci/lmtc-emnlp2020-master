The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. That tolerance is defined in Article 23(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008\u00a0(2).\n(2) By Commission Decision 2001/468/EC\u00a0(3), the use of two methods for grading pig carcases in Italy was authorised.\n(3) As the authorised grading methods needed technical adaptation Italy has requested the Commission to authorise the replacement of the formula used in the \u2018Fat-O-Meater\u2019 and \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe 7\u2019 methods, as well as to authorise the four new methods \u2018AutoFom III\u2019, \u2018Fat-O-Meat\u2019er II\u2019, \u2018CSB-Image-Meater\u2019 and \u2018Manual method ZP\u2019 for grading pig carcases on its territory. Italy has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which the new formula are based, the result of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008.\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those new formulae are fulfilled. Those formulae should therefore be authorised in Italy.\n(5) Italy has requested the Commission to be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation laid down in the first paragraph of Section B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(6) In accordance with the second paragraph of Section B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation defined in the first paragraph of that point, where normal commercial practice in their territory differs from that standard presentation. In its request, Italy specified that in its territory it is commercial practice that carcases can be presented without the diaphragm and flare fat having been removed before being weighed and graded. This presentation that differs from the standard presentation should therefore be authorised in Italy.\n(7) In order to establish quotations for pig carcases on a comparable basis, this different presentation should be taken into account by adjusting the weight recorded in such cases in relation to the weight for standard presentation.\n(8) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, a new decision should be adopted. Decision 2001/468/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(9) Modifications of the apparatuses or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Implementing Decision.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to point 1 of Section B.IV of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in Italy:\n(a) the \u2018Fat-O-Meater I (FOM I)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part I of the Annex;\n(b) the \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe 7 (HGP 7)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part II of the Annex;\n(c) the \u2018Fat-O-Meat\u2019er II (FOM II)\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part III of the Annex;\n(d) the \u2018AutoFom III\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part IV of the Annex;\n(e) the \u2018CSB-Image-Meater\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part V of the Annex;\n(f) the \u2018Manual method ZP\u2019 apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part VI of the Annex.", "Notwithstanding the standard presentation laid down in the first paragraph of Section B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, pig carcases in Italy may be presented without the diaphragm and flare fat having been removed before being weighed and graded.

The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus called \u2018Fat-O-Meat\u2019er II\u2019 (FOM II).\n2. The apparatus is a new version of the Fat-O-Meat\u2019er measurement system. The FOM II consists of an optical probe with a knife, a depth measurement device having an operating distance of between 0 and 125 millimetres and a data acquisition and analysis board \u2013 Carometec Touch Panel i15 computer (Ingress Protection IP69K). The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by the FOM II apparatus itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 70 and 110\u00a0kg\n(b) carcases weighing between 110,1 and 180\u00a0kg\n\u0177 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8\u00a0cm off the midline of the carcase at the level placed between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the thickness of the Longissimus dorsi muscle, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\nPART IV\nAutoFom III\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018AutoFom III\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with sixteen 2\u00a0MHz ultrasonic transducers (Carometec A/S), with an operating distance between transducers of 25\u00a0mm. The ultrasonic data shall comprise measurements of back fat thickness, muscle thickness and related parameters. The results of the measurements are converted into estimates of the percentage of lean meat by using a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 70 and 110\u00a0kg\nY = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = (R2P1) average skin thickness in mm\nx2 = (R2P4) the P2 fat measure at the selected position in mm where P2 is the minimum fat depth 7\u00a0cm from the midline 2/3 rib without skin\nx3 = (R2P11) minpair filter result.

The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018CSB Image-Meater\u2019.\n2. The CSB Image-Meater consists in particular of a video camera, a PC equipped with an image-analysis card, a screen, a printer, a command mechanism, a rate mechanism and interfaces. The 3 Image-Meater variables are all measured at the split line in the ham area (around M. gluteus medius):\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 70 and 110\u00a0kg\nY = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = (MF) mean lean mass, measured in correspondence of the muscle gluteus medius (mm)\nx2 = (ML) length of the muscle gluteus medius\nx3 = (MS) medium fat mass, measured in correspondence of the muscle gluteus medius (mm)\nx4 = (WbS) medium fat mass, measured in correspondence of the second vertebra, detected starting from the front (cranial) end of the muscle gluteus medius (Vb)\n(b) carcases weighing between 110,1 and 180\u00a0kg\nY = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = (MF) mean meat measure \u2014 over the length of muscle gluteus medius (mm)\nx2 = (ML) length of the muscle gluteus medius\nx3 = (MS) mean fat measure above (dorsal of) muscle gluteus medius (mm)\nx4 = S (mm) depth of the fat layer, measured at the thinnest point over the muscle gluteus medius\nPART VI\nManual method (ZP)\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcases is carried out by use of the \u2018manual method (ZP)\u2019 measuring by ruler\n2. This method may be implemented using a ruler, with the grading determined on the basis of the prediction equation. It is based on the manual measurement on the midline of the split carcase of the thickness of the fat and of the thickness of the muscle.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n(a) carcases weighing between 70 and 110\u00a0kg\n(b) carcases weighing between 110,1 and 180\u00a0kg\nY = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the minimal fat depth in millimetres (including rind) over the muscle gluteus medius\nx2 = the minimal muscle depth in millimetres between the anterior extremity of the muscle gluteus medius and the dorsal part of the medullary canal"}
