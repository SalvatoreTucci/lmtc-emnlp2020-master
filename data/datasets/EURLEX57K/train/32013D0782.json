That Standard ensures that all parts of sawn hardwood lumber exported under that Program are kiln-dried to less than 20\u00a0% moisture by weight as per kiln-drying schedules and are bark-free.\n(5) That Standard also ensures that all kiln-dried hardwood bundles are attached with an NHLA steel ID clip stamped with \u2018NHLA \u2014 KD\u2019 along with a unique number assigned to each bundle. Each number is listed on the corresponding Kiln Drying Hardwood Lumber Certificate (\u2018Certificate of Kiln Drying\u2019).\n(6) Therefore, a derogation should be provided for allowing bark-free sawn wood of Acer macrophyllum Pursh and Quercus spp. L. originating in the United States of America to be introduced into the Union when accompanied by a Certificate of Kiln Drying as an alternative to a phytosanitary certificate provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.\n(7) The Commission should ensure that the United States of America makes available all technical information necessary to assess the functioning of the Program. In addition, Member States should continually assess the use of the NHLA ID clips and associated Certificate of Kiln Drying.\n(8) The derogation provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Decision 2002/757/EC as amended by this Decision should apply until 30 November 2016 in order to align it with the requirements of Commission Implementing Decision 2013/780/EU\u00a0(3).", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/757/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 3, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 3(2) and (3) and Article 5(1), the words \u2018of the Annex to this Decision\u2019 are replaced by \u2018of Annex I to this Decision\u2019 and any grammatical adjustments needed as a consequence of this replacement shall be made;\n(3) the following Article 6a is inserted:\n(4) the Annex is renamed as Annex I;\n(5) an Annex II is added, the text of which is set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2002/757/EC of 19 September 2002 on provisional emergency phytosanitary measures to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Community of Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man in \u2019t Veld sp. nov.
