ANNEX   OBJECTIVES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES\nThe Plan takes the form of a number of temporary financial support measures, aimed at encouraging access to large-scale scientific and technical facilities and installations within the Community. It is of potential benefit to all researchers in the  exact and natural sciences who are nationals of one of the Member States.\n1.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe precise objectives of the plan take the following form:\n- to encourage access by researchers who are nationals of Member States to major scientific and technical installations within the Community to which they would not normally enjoy access,\n- to increase training opportunities available to European researchers so as to enable them to make better use of major scientific and technical installations,\n- to develop the use of large-scale scientific and technical facilities within the Community, where necessary by adaptation and/or the addition of special features.\n2.\nPOTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES\nCommunity financial support may be made available to:\n- any organization within the Community which possesses major scientific and technical equipment or an installation of interest to the exact and natural sciences,\n- any researcher or engineer who is a national of one of the Member States and is currently working in a public or private sector laboratory in one of the Member States. All fields of the exact and natural sciences are eligible.\n3.\nPROCEDURAL ARRANGEMENTS\n3.1.\nCall for proposals and selection procedure\n(a)  The Commission will publish a call for preliminary proposals from organizations or groups of organizations within the Community having one or more major scientific and technical installation with experimental and/or test facilities which could be  made available to scientists or research workers who have hitherto been unable to use them.\nThe Commission will also ensure that scientists and research workers who could potentially benefit under the Plan from access to the facilities in question are informed of the possibilities likely to become available. The preliminary proposals received  from those responsible for the large-scale facilities should be accompanied by a written statement of interest expressed by potential new users.\nAll information regarding the call for proposals and the selection procedure shall be published simultaneously in all the official languages of the Community in order to ensure that the opportunity to participate in the Plan is available on equal terms  in all the Member States.\n(b)  The Commission will draw up a draft preselection list of preliminary proposals to be retained. The Committee referred to in Article 3 of the Decision will be informed of the proposals received and will give an opinion on the draft preselection list  according to the procedure set out in Article 3 (3). The Commission will then establish a preselection list of facilities which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n(c)  On the basis of the preselection list, the Commission will ask for \u00c2\u00b4joint proposals' from the installations and potential users concerned. The Commission may, if necessary, assist in the organization of meetings between those responsible for the  installations and potential users (financing of joint meetings, etc.).\n(d)  The Commission will submit the list of joint proposals received to the Committee, which shall, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 3 (3) of the Decision, give an opinion on the operations with a view to financial support from the  Plan. The Commission will then proceed to the final selection of the operations to benefit from Community support.\n3.2.\nChoice of installations to receive Community support\nCriteria of selection\nThe assessment of the value of Community support will be based upon an evaluation of the proposal put forward, on the basis of the following criteria:\n(a)  Quality of the facility:\n- specific characteristics,\n- originality or uniqueness,\n- up-to-dateness,\n- range of experiments or tests possible,\n- back-up and technical support available.\n(b)  Interest shown by potential users:\n- priority will be given to researchers from Member States other than that in which the major installation is situated.\n(c)  Cost/benefit ratio of Community support:\n- the number and quality of opportunities made available at the facility in return for Community support.\n(d)  Value to the Community:\n- importance of the facility in respect of the Community's overall scientific and technical potential,\n- value of the experimental opportunities made available in terms of achieving the Community's scientific and technical objectives (potential links with sectoral R &   D objectives),\n- value of the facility in terms of strengthening the scientific and technical potential of certain countries or regions of the Community.\n3.4.\nMechanisms for giving Community support to selected installations\nThe Commission will conclude an agreement with the recipient organization or institution which will set out:\n- the level of Community funding,\n- the uses to which it may be put, including a quantification of the opportunities for access to visiting scientists,\n- the obligations imposed upon the recipient organization.\nThe obligations imposed on the recipient organization include:\n- making possible the use of the equipment and installations forming the subject of the agreement at no extra charge by researchers not belonging to the recipient organization or institution, this being for a fixed period of time over the year,\n- ensuring access by visiting scientists to the scientific and technical back-up services on site.\nThe contracts will also specify:\n- the payment from Community funds to visiting scientists and research workers of all eligible expenditure covered by the Plan,\n- the methods by which the results arising from research carried out under the agreement are to be protected, disseminated and exploited.\nFinally, the Commission will, in cooperation with the installations concerned, take all appropriate measures to ensure the best possible implementation of the operations selected (programming, availability of machine time, etc.).\n3.4.\nImplementation report\nAt the end of each year of Community support, the beneficiary organization or institute will make a report to the Commission on the use to which the funds awarded to them were put and the results arising from the use which outside researchers made of  the facilities made available to them in the context of the agreement signed with the Commission."}
