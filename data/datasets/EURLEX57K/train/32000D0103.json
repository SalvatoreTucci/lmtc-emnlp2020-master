However, in order to ensure the continuity of monitoring and control activities in ICES zones VI, VII and VIII, it is essential that France and Ireland incur some expenditure which they cannot cover from their own budgets. Without any Community financial contribution the financing of investments programmed for 1999 would be seriously jeopardised and it would be impossible to attain the necessary monitoring and control objectives. It is therefore warranted to provide, exceptionally, for a financial contribution to the essential expenditure of France and Italy for 1999.\n(4) Greece has forwarded additional information concerning its request for a financial contribution towards the expenditure referred to in Article 2 of Decision 95/527/EC for 1999 which will affect the amount of expenditure eligible for a financial contribution under that Decision.\n(5) Commission Decision 1999/354/EC should therefore be amended.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Decision 1999/354/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in the first sentence of Article 1, \"EUR 108378475\" is replaced by \"EUR 113744098\";\n2. in the second sentence of Article 1, \"EUR 33833388\" is replaced by \"EUR 35570045\";\n3. in the second sentence of Article 2(1). \"EUR 11024266\" is replaced by \"EUR 11424166\";\n4. in the first sentence of Article 2(2), \"EUR 2500\" is replaced by \"EUR 2800\";\n5. in the second sentence of Article 2(2). \"EUR 2500\" is replaced by \"EUR 2800\";\n6. in the third sentence of Article 2(2). \"EUR 3250\" is replaced by \"EUR 3400\";\n7. in the last sentence of Article 2(2), \"EUR 6750000\" is replaced by \"EUR 7500000\";\n8. the following Article is inserted after Article 2:\n\"Article 2a\nIreland's investment expenditure planned for 1999, amounting to EUR 13693872, shall be eligible for a financial contribution under Article 3(3) of Decision 95/52/EC.
