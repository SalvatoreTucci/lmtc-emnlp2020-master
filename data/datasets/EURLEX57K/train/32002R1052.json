As a consequence the wording of the instruction given at Annex F III (k) should also be amended.\n(7) In respect of the goods listed in Annex C, the quantity of basic products to be taken in calculating the amount of the refund shall be that shown in that Annex against each of those goods. However, the quantity shown in respect of CN code ex 2008 99 85 should be modified as it is excessive.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 is amended as follows:\n1. the following paragraph 1a is added to Article 6(1):\n\"1a.
