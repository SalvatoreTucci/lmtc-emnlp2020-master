Imports of products shipped from Pakistan to Germany, Benelux, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Greece and Portugal after the entry into force of this Regulation shall be subject to the double-checking system described in Annex VI to Regulation  (EEC) No 4136/86.\n3. All quantities of products shipped from Pakistan to Germany, Benelux, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Greece and Portugal on or after 18 September 1991 and released for free circulation shall be deducted from the quantitative limits laid down.
