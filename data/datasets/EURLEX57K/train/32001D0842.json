It is therefore appropriate to lift the suspension of imports into the Community of de-boned fresh meat for human consumption, and of certain meat and offal for direct treatment for pet food, and to reintroduce to that effect the region of Rio Grande do Sul into the list of Annex I to Decision 93/402/EEC.\n(6) Decision 2001/410/EC also provided for a clarification of the conditions applicable for Uruguay but this clarification is now consolidated by Decision 2001/767/EC and therefore Decision 2001/410/EC can be repealed in its entirety.\n(7) Council Directive 93/119/EC(6) requires that the veterinary health certificate accompanying meat to be imported from third countries to the European Community must be supplemented by an attestation certifying that the animals have been slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to the relevant provisions of the Directive; it is opportune to introduce this certification requirement into the model health certificate itself at the time when other amendments to the model are required.\n(8) It is also opportune to update the model veterinary certificates to require the container number and corresponding seal number to be included on the certificates and also to provide for an attestation on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter.\n(9) Decision 93/402/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly and Decision 2001/410/EC should be repealed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Decision 93/402/EEC are replaced by the corresponding Annexes to this Decision.", "Decision 2001/410/EC is hereby repealed.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 December 2001 after being reviewed at the Standing Veterinary Committee scheduled for 20 to 21 November 2001.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(3) OJ L 179, 22.7.1993, p. 11.\n(4) OJ L 288, 1.11.2001, p. 51.\n(5) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 49.\n(6) OJ L 340, 31.12.1993, p. 21.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX I\nDescription of territories of South America established for animal health certification purposes\n>TABLE>\"\n\"ANNEX II\nANIMAL HEALTH GUARANTEES REQUESTED ON CERTIFICATION ((The letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) appearing on the table, are referring to the models of animal health guarantees as described in Annex III Part 2 of this Decision, to be applied for each product and origin in accordance with Article 2 of this Decision; a dash (-) indicates that imports are not authorised.HC: Human consumption.\nMP: Destined for heat-treated meat products industry:\n1= hearts.\n2= livers.\n3= masseter muscles.\n4= tongues.\nPF: Destined for the pet food industry.))\n>TABLE>\"\n\"ANNEX III\nPART 1\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.004902.TIF\">\nPART 2\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005001.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005101.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005201.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005301.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005401.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005501.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005601.TIF\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001313EN.005701.TIF\">\""}
