The same holds for products which, by virtue of being either the subject of a binding tariff reduction under the WTO or some other preferential arrangements, must comply with a reference price.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 29(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the reference price for the products listed in Annex I, Parts A and B to that Regulation, is to be the same as the withdrawal price fixed in accordance with Article\u00a020(1) of that Regulation.\n(3) The EU withdrawal prices for the products concerned are fixed for the 2010 fishing year by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1277/2009\u00a0(2).\n(4) Pursuant to Article 29(3)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the reference price for products other than those listed in Annexes I and II to that Regulation is to be established in particular on the basis of the weighted average of customs values recorded on the import markets or in the ports of import in the three years immediately preceding the date on which the reference price is fixed.\n(5) There is no need to fix reference prices for those products falling under the criteria laid down in Art. 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 which are imported from third countries in insignificant volumes.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["The reference prices for the 2010 fishing year of fishery products, as referred to in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, are set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter
