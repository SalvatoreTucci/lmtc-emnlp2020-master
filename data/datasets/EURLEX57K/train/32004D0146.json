This information suggests that in Saarland the situation has improved and vaccination is no longer considered appropriate. However, in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, the area where the eradication and the vaccination plan are to be applied should be extended.\n(3) Decision 2003/135/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/135/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
