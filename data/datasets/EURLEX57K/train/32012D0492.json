The disease can be prevented by vaccination and during recent years it has increased in incidence and spread to new geographical areas in Europe. These developments are probably due to different causes, including climate change and modification of tick habitat.\n(4) TBE therefore fulfils the criteria set in Annex II to Decision 2000/96/EC for the selection of communicable diseases to be covered by epidemiological surveillance within the Community network set up by Decision No 2119/98/EC, and it is appropriate to add it to the list of communicable diseases to be covered by this epidemiological surveillance in Annex I to Decision 2000/96/EC.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Decision No 2119/98/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2000/96/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 September 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 28, 3.2.2000, p. 50.\nANNEX\nIn point 2.5 of Annex I to Decision 2000/96/EC, the following point 2.5.5 is added:\n\u20182.5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vector-borne diseases\nTick-borne encephalitis (TBE)\u2019"}
