APPLICATION FOR EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL      1.1. The application for EEC component type-approval shall be submitted by the holder of the trade name or mark or by his authorized representative.\n1.2. For each type of rear fog lamp, the application shall be accompanied by:        1.2.1. a brief technical description stating, in particular, the type(s) of filament lamp(s) recommended, which must comply with the specifications of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE);\n1.2.2. drawings, (three copies), in sufficient detail to permit identification of the type of the rear fog lamp and showing, geometrically, the position in which the rear fog lamp is to be mounted on the vehicle, the axis of observation to be taken as the axis of reference in the tests (horizontal angle H = 0\u0e22\u0e1a, vertical angle V = 0\u0e22\u0e1a), and the point to be taken as the centre of reference in the said tests;\n1.2.3. two samples ; if the rear fog lamp is such that it can be mounted only on one side of the vehicle, the two samples submitted may be identical and be suitable for mounting only on the right or only on the left side of the vehicle;\n1.2.4. an additional sample to be kept by the laboratory for any subsequent verification which may prove necessary.\n2. MARKINGS      2.1. The samples of a type of rear fog lamp submitted for EEC component type-approval must bear:        2.1.1. the trade name or mark of the applicant, which must be clearly legible and indelible;\n2.1.2. a clearly legible and indelible marking indicating the type(s) of filament lamp(s) recommended;\n2.1.3. and incorporate a space large enough to contain the EEC component type-approval mark, including the additional symbols prescribed in 4 ; this space shall be shown in the drawings mentioned in 1.2.2.\n3.
