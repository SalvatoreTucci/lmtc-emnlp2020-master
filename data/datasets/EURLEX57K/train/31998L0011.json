Where this information is provided in a table this may be expressed by other means provided it is clear that the scale is from A (more efficient) to G (less efficient).\n2. Luminous flux of the lamp\n3. Input power\n4. Average rated life of lamp\n(Where no other information on the life of the lamp is given in the catalogue, this may be omitted).\nLamps shall be classified in class A if:\n\u2014 Fluorescent lamps without integral ballast\n\u2014 Other lamps\nIf a lamp is not classified in class A, a reference wattage WR shall be calculated as follows:\nwhen \u03a6 > 34 lumens\n0,2 \u03a6, when \u03a6 \u2264 34 lumens\nwhere \u03a6 is the lumen output of the lamp.\nAn energy efficiency index E1 is then set as\nwhere W is the power input into the lamp in watts.\nThe energy efficiency classes are then set in accordance with the following table:\nEnergy efficiency class Energy efficiency index E1\nB E1 < 60 %\nC 60 % \u2264 E1 < 80 %\nD 80 % \u2264 E1 < 95 %\nE 95 % \u2264 E1 < 110 %\nF 110 % \u2264 E1 < 130 %\nG E1 \u2265 130 %"}
