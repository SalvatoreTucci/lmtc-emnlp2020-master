Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) are added to stop oxidation and to prevent microbiological contaminations, resulting in a better preservation of flavour and colour of the products. These products, such as vermouth, should in particular be protected as they are often preserved for a long time after the bottle has been opened.\n(5) Acceptable daily intakes have been established by the Scientific Committee for Food for sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228)\u00a0(4). Aromatised wine-based products are alcoholic beverages that are usually consumed as an alternative to other alcoholic beverages such as wine in which sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites are authorised. The additional exposure to sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) based on this new use will remain limited and will not lead to an increase of the overall intake. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) as preservative and antioxidant in aromatised wine-based products.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites (E 220-228) as preservative and antioxidant in aromatised wine-based products constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(7) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 of 10 June 1991 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatized wines, aromatized wine-based drinks and aromatized wine-product cocktails (OJ L 149, 14.6.1991, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/reports/scf_reports_35.pdf\nANNEX\nPart E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended a follows:\n(1) In food category 14.2.7.1 \u2018Aromatised wines\u2019 the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 200-203:\n\u2018E 220-228 Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites 200 (3)\n(3): Maximum levels are expressed as SO2 relate to the total quantity, available from all sources, an SO2 content of not more than 10\u00a0mg/kg or 10\u00a0mg/l is not considered to be present\u2019\n(2) In food category 14.2.7.2 \u2018Aromatised wine-based drinks\u2019 the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 200-203:\n\u2018E 220-228 Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites 200 (3)\n(3): Maximum levels are expressed as SO2 relate to the total quantity, available from all sources, an SO2 content of not more than 10\u00a0mg/kg or 10\u00a0mg/l is not considered to be present\u2019\n(3) In food category 14.2.7.3 \u2018Aromatised wine-product cocktails\u2019 the following entry is inserted after the entry for E 200-203:\n\u2018E 220-228 Sulphur dioxide \u2014 sulphites 200 (3)\n(3): Maximum levels are expressed as SO2 relate to the total quantity, available from all sources, an SO2 content of not more than 10\u00a0mg/kg or 10\u00a0mg/l is not considered to be present\u2019"}
