As a consequence, the Member States concerned have taken precautionary measures to temporarily suspend the placing on the market of plant protection products containing those substances.\n(3) Clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid may only be authorised for uses as insecticide, including the use as seed treatment. Fipronil, however, may only be authorised for uses as insecticide for use as seed treatment. The accidents reported by Member States concern the inappropriate use of those active substances to treat seeds.\n(4) To avoid future accidents, additional provisions, including appropriate risk mitigation measures, should be laid down for clothianidin, thiamethoxam, fipronil and imidacloprid.\n(5) Directive 91/414/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measure provided for in this Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 October 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
