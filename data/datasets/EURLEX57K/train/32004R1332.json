The additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to that Directive may be authorised without a time limit subject to certain conditions being satisfied.\n(2) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 10287) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and piglets by Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(2).\n(3) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Humicola insolens (DSM 10442) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(2).\n(4) New data were submitted in support of the applications for authorisation without a time limit of each of these enzyme preparations. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisations are satisfied in each case.\n(5) Accordingly, the use of these enzyme preparations should be authorised without a time, under certain conditions.\n(6) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(3).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as set out in Annexes I and II, are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in those Annexes.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
