In particular it contains a list of materials whose placing on the market or use for animal nutritional purposes is restricted or prohibited.\n(2) Council Directive 82/471/EEC\u00a0(2) and Commission Decision 85/382/EEC of 10 July 1985 prohibiting the use in feedingstuffs of protein products obtained from Candida yeasts cultivated on n-alkanes\u00a0(3) prohibit the placing on the market and the use in feed of protein products obtained from Candida yeasts cultivated on n-alkanes. The reason for this prohibition is that certain strains of yeast of the Candida variety cultivated on n-alkanes are pathogenic and, in some circumstances, may give rise to hypersensitivity reactions, thus presenting potential hazards to animal or human health.\n(3) Since there are neither new technical developments nor new evidence establishing that the use of such protein products for animal nutritional purposes is safe, the placing on the market and the use of those products should continue to be prohibited and Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 should establish that prohibition.\n(4) The list of materials whose placing on the market for animal nutritional purposes is prohibited, previously provided for in Commission Decision 2004/217/EC\u00a0(4), had to be included in Chapter 1 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, in order to manage feed safety risks.\n(5) Points 5 and 6 of Chapter 1 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 should be aligned with Decision 2004/217/EC.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) In the interests of clarity, Decision 85/382/EEC should be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Chapter 1 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 is amended as follows:\n1. points 5 and 6 are replaced by the following:\n\u20185.
