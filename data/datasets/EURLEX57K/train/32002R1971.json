Consequently, from that marketing year onwards, the date of the operative event for area payments in respect of flax and hemp grown for fibre has moved from 1 August to 1 July.\n(5) Examination of the rates laid down for the pound sterling and the Swedish krona by Regulation (EC) No 1468/2002 of 12 August 2002 setting the conversion rate applicable to certain direct aids whose operative event is 1 July 2002(6) indicates that those currencies have depreciated.\n(6) For the United Kingdom, therefore, the third tranche of the compensatory aid whose operative event falls between 1 July 2000 and 1 August 2000 should be cancelled, as well as the second tranche of compensatory aid whose operative event falls on 1 July 2001.\n(7) Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1967/2001 of 8 October 2001 adjusting certain compensatory agrimonetary aids granted in Denmark and Sweden(7), the granting of the second tranche of compensatory aid whose operative event falls between 1 July 2000 and 1 August 2000 is not authorised for Sweden. In the interest of clarity, in particular as a result of changes in the value of the Swedish krona, the third tranche of this compensatory aid for Sweden should be cancelled.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["1.
