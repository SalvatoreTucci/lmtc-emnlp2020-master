This Directive therefore establishes the notification format defining the minimum data needed, without prejudice to the faculty of Member States to maintain or introduce in their territory more stringent protective measures which comply with the provisions of the Treaty as provided under Article 4(2) of Directive 2002/98/EC.\n(4) This Directive lays down those technical requirements, which take account of Council Recommendation 98/463/EC of 29 June 1998 on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood in the European Community\u00a0(2), Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6\u00a0November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use\u00a0(3), Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 implementing Directive 2002/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards certain technical requirements for blood and blood components\u00a0(4), and certain recommendations of the Council of Europe.\n(5) Accordingly, blood and blood components imported from third countries, including those used as starting material or raw material for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma, intended for distribution in the Community, should meet equivalent Community standards and specifications relating to traceability and serious adverse reaction and serious adverse event notification requirements as set out in this Directive.\n(6) It is necessary to determine common definitions for technical terminology in order to ensure the consistent implementation of Directive 2002/98/EC.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Directive 2002/98/EC,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018traceability\u2019 means the ability to trace each individual unit of blood or blood component derived thereof from the donor to its final destination, whether this is a recipient, a manufacturer of medicinal products or disposal, and vice versa;\n(b) \u2018reporting establishment\u2019 means the blood establishment, the hospital blood bank or facilities where the transfusion takes place that reports serious adverse reactions and/or serious adverse events to the competent authority;\n(c) \u2018recipient\u2019 means someone who has been transfused with blood or blood components;\n(d) \u2018issue\u2019 means the provision of blood or blood components by a blood establishment or a hospital blood bank for transfusion to a recipient;\n(e) \u2018imputability\u2019 means the likelihood that a serious adverse reaction in a recipient can be attributed to the blood or blood component transfused or that a serious adverse reaction in a donor can be attributed to the donation process;\n(f) \u2018facilities\u2019 means hospitals, clinics, manufacturers, and bio-medical research institutions to which blood or blood components may be delivered.", "Traceability\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure the traceability of blood and blood components
