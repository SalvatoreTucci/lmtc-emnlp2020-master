In order to facilitate trade of pigmeat under those two import quotas it is necessary to increase that maximum quantity.\n(3) Regulations (EC) No 1432/94 and (EC) No 1458/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["In Article 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1432/94, the rate of \u201810\u00a0%\u2019 is replaced by \u201820\u00a0%\u2019.", "In Article 4(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1458/2003, the rates of \u201810\u00a0%\u2019 are replaced by \u201820\u00a0%\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to licence applications lodged as from 1 March 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 February 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 1.
