The emergence of this disease presented a serious risk for the Community\u2019s livestock population.\n(2) In order to prevent the spread of the disease and to help eradicate it as quickly as possible, the Community must contribute financially towards the eligible expenditure incurred by the Member State under the emergency measures taken to combat the disease, as provided for in Decision 90/424/EEC.\n(3) Commission Decision 2004/51/EC of 23 December 2003 on the financial contribution from the Community towards the eligible costs of the eradication of avian influenza in Germany in 2003\u00a0(2) granted a financial contribution from the Community to Germany towards the expenditure incurred under the emergency measures taken to combat avian influenza in 2003.\n(4) In accordance with that Decision, a first instalment of EUR 135\u00a0000 was paid.\n(5) Pursuant to that Decision, the balance of the Community contribution is to be based on the claim submitted by Germany on 25 February 2004, documentary evidence of the expenditure referred to in that claim, and the results of on-the-spot checks carried out by the Commission.
