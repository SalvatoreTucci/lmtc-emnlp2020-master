That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of monensin sodium as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019.\n(4) The use of monensin sodium was authorised for 10 years as a feed additive for use in chickens for fattening and turkeys up to 16 weeks by Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/2007\u00a0(2).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 15 November 2011\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, monensin sodium does not have an adverse effect on human health, animal health or the environment, and that its use is efficacious in controlling eimeria infections. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of monensin sodium shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 6.2.2007, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(12):2442.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Provisional maximum residue limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition\nMonensin sodium technical substance equivalent to monensin activity: 25\u00a0%\nPerlite: 15\u00a0%\u201320\u00a0%\nCalcium carbonate q.s.100\u00a0%\nActive substance\nMonensin A: not less than 90\u00a0%\nMonensin A + B: not less than 95\u00a0%\nMonensin C: 0,2-0,3\u00a0%\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1)\n1.
