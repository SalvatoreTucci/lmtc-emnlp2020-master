whereas Italy acting as nominated rapporteur Member State, has submitted to the Commission on 22 May 1997 the assessment report concerned;\n(5) Whereas the submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health; whereas this review has been finalised on 2 July 1999 in the format of the Commission review report for azimsulfuron; whereas it may be necessary to update this report to take account of technical and scientific developments; whereas in such case the conditions for the inclusion of azimsulfuron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC will also need to be amended pursuant to Article 6(1) of that Directive;\n(6) Whereas the dossier and the information from the review have also been submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for opinion; whereas this Committee has given its opinion on 4 February 1999; whereas this Committee identified potential risks to aquatic organisms and terrestrial non-target plants, whereas therefore appropriate risk mitigation measures must be taken(4);\n(7) Whereas it has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a),(b) and (3) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined; whereas therefore it is necessary to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the said Directive;\n(8) Whereas after inclusion a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC on plant protection products containing azimsulfuron and in particular to review, within this period, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive;
