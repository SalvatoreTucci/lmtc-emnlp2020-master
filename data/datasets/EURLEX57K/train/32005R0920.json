It is however appropriate to decide that, for practical reasons and on a transitional basis, the institutions of the European Union are not to be bound by the obligation to draft and translate all acts, including judgments of the Court of Justice, in the Irish language. It is also appropriate to provide that such a derogation be partial, to exclude from its scope Regulations adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council and to empower the Council to determine unanimously, within a period of four years after the date of application of this Regulation and at five-yearly intervals thereafter, whether to put an end to that derogation,", "main_body": ["Regulation No 1 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
