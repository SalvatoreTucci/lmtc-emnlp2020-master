Realising that the relief regarding restatement of comparative disclosures in IFRS 7 concerning fair value measurements and liquidity risk if those comparative periods end before 31 December 2009 is not available to entities that apply IFRS for the first time, the aim of the amendment to IFRS 1 is to provide for an optional relief for those entities.\n(3) The consultation with the Technical Expert Group (TEG) of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) confirms that the amendment to IFRS 1 meets the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. In accordance with Commission Decision 2006/505/EC of 14 July 2006 setting up a Standards Advice Review Group to advise the Commission on the objectivity and neutrality of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAG\u2019s) opinions\u00a0(3), the Standards Advice Review Group considered EFRAG's opinion on endorsement and advised the Commission that it is well-balanced and objective.\n(4) The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 1 implies, by way of consequence, amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 in order to ensure consistency between international accounting standards.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Accounting Regulatory Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.

To avoid the potential use of hindsight and to ensure that first-time adopters are not disadvantaged as compared with current IFRS preparers, the Board decided that first-time adopters should be permitted to use the same transition provisions permitted for existing preparers of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs that are included in Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 44G was amended as a consequence of Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters (Amendment to IFRS 1) issued in January 2010. The Board amended paragraph 44G to clarify its conclusions and intended transition for Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7)."}
