The United Kingdom also requested for the turnover limit for the simplified cash accounting scheme to be increased from GBP 660\u00a0000 to GBP 1\u00a0350\u00a0000.\n(3) By letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 31 August 2006, Estonia requested a derogation from Article 17(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC to allow the VAT to become deductible by the taxable person when the supplier is paid. This postponement of deduction will apply only under a simplified cash accounting scheme under which taxable persons account for the output VAT for their supplies when they have received payment from their customers, pursuant to the second indent of the third subparagraph of Article 10(2) of the said Directive. Estonia requested that the cash accounting scheme be limited to taxable persons classified as sole proprietors under Estonian law.\n(4) By letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 27 June 2006, Slovenia requested a derogation from Article 17(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC to allow the VAT to become deductible by the taxable person when the supplier is paid. This postponement of deduction will apply only under a simplified cash accounting scheme under which taxable persons account for the output VAT for their supplies when they have received payment from their customers, pursuant to the second indent of the third subparagraph of Article 10(2) of the said Directive. Slovenia requested that the turnover limit for their simplified cash accounting scheme be set at EUR 208\u00a0646.\n(5) By letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 6 April 2006, Sweden requested a derogation from Article 17(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC to allow the VAT to become deductible by the taxable person when the supplier is paid. This postponement of deduction will apply only under a simplified cash accounting scheme under which taxable persons account for the output VAT for their supplies when they have received payment from their customers, pursuant to the second indent of the third subparagraph of Article 10(2) of the said Directive. Sweden requested that the turnover limit for their simplified cash accounting scheme be set at SEK 3\u00a0000\u00a0000.\n(6) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 6 October 2006 of the request made by Estonia, by letter dated 6 October 2006 of the request made by Slovenia, by letter dated 4 October 2006 of the request made by Sweden and by letter dated 6 October 2006 of the request made by the United Kingdom. By letter dated 6 October 2006 the Commission notified Sweden and by letters dated 9 October 2006 the Commission notified Estonia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom, that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of their request.\n(7) Directive 77/388/EEC has been recast and repealed by Directive 2006/112/EC. References to the provisions of the former are to be construed as references to the latter.\n(8) The cash accounting scheme is a simplification measure for small and medium sized businesses. Regarding the United Kingdom, raising the ceiling for the simplified scheme will allow a greater number of firms to opt for the scheme. The increase of the turnover limit would extend the scheme to a potential additional 57\u00a0000 businesses. The derogation requested by Estonia will allow 5\u00a0700 businesses to use the cash accounting scheme. In the case of Slovenia, 62\u00a0000 businesses will be able to opt for the use of the cash accounting scheme. As for Sweden, the scheme will be available to 630\u00a0000 businesses.\n(9) The Estonian, Slovenian, Swedish and United Kingdom derogations can be accepted in view of the percentage of eligible businesses that could opt for this simplified scheme and the limited duration.\n(10) Since taxable persons who have applied the optional scheme in the past should be able to continue using it without interruption, the authorisation given to the United Kingdom should apply from the date of expiry of Decision 97/375/EC. Also as this would allow more taxable persons to adopt the scheme from the beginning of their accounting year, Member States concerned should be allowed to make the optional scheme available as from 1 January 2007.\n(11) The derogation in question does not affect the overall amount of the tax revenue of the Member States collected at the stage of final consumption and as a consequence does not have a negative effect on the own resources of the European Communities accruing from VAT.\n(12) Given the urgency of the matter, in order to avoid a legal gap, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 167 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Estonia, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom are authorised to postpone the right of deduction of the input tax of the taxable persons, as defined in the second paragraph, until the input tax has been paid to their suppliers.\nThe taxable persons concerned must use a scheme whereby they account for the output VAT for their supplies when they have received the payments from their customers.
