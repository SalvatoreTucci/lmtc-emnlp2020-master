This average interest rate should nevertheless be partially borne by the Member State concerned in order to encourage it to seek the least costly financing method.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) This amendment to the rules should be carried out for the financial years 2007 and 2008 and should apply from the beginning of the current accounting year,", "main_body": ["The third subparagraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, if the average interest rate borne by a Member State in the course of the third month following the reference period used for the establishment of the uniform interest rate by the Commission is more than twice the uniform interest rate, the Commission may, for the financial years 2007 and 2008, in financing the interest costs incurred by that Member State, cover the amount which corresponds to the interest rate borne by this Member State minus the uniform rate of interest.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to expenditure incurred from 1 October 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 11 June 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.
