The Danish general Government net borrowing decreased in 1994 and 1995, reaching 1,4 % of GDP in 1995, a level well below the Treaty reference value. It is expected to decline further in 1996;\nA reduction in the gross debt ratio was achieved in 1994 and 1995, when the ratio was reduced from 80,1 % of GDP to 71,9 % of GDP. The evolution of the gross debt ratio, in particular its earlier increase, has been heavily influenced by special institutional features, which accounted for some 19 percent of GDP in 1995;\nThe deficit is now well below the Treaty reference value, and should remain so in the medium term, and the gross debt ratio has declined sharply for two consecutive years and is expected to decline markedly further,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment, it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Denmark has been corrected.", "The Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Denmark is hereby abrogated.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 27 June 1996.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
