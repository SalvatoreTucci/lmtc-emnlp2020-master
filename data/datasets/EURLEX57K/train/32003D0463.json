On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 July 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 1349/2000 of 19 June 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol.\n(5) Negotiations for further improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Estonia were concluded on 31 January 2002. The results of the negotiations have so far been implemented in the form of autonomous measures, applicable as from 1 July 2002. On the Community side, the autonomous measures were implemented by Council Regulation (EC) No 1151/2002(4).\n(6) The new Protocol to the Europe Agreement adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Estonia, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the Protocol) should be approved with a view to consolidating all concessions in agricultural trade between the two sides, including the results of the negotiations concluded in 2000 and 2002.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5) has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Certain tariff quotas under this Decision should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).\n(9) As a result of the aforementioned negotiations, Regulation (EC) No 1151/2002 has been superseded and should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["The Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Estonia, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concessions, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Community.", "1.
