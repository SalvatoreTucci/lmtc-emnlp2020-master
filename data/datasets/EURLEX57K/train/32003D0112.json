As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain \"appropriate measures\" within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nToday, after more than 12 months and various mediation attempts, the European Union considers that democratic principles are still not upheld in Zimbabwe and that no progress has been achieved by the Government of Zimbabwe in the five fields addressed by the February Council Decision (end of politically motivated violence, free and fair elections, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, end of illegal occupations).\nIn the light of the above, the European Union does not consider that the appropriate measures can be revoked.\nThe measures will only be revoked once conditions prevail which ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. Moreover, the European Union reserves the right to take additional restrictive measures.\nThe European Union will closely follow developments in Zimbabwe and would once again like to emphasise that it does not wish to penalise the Zimbabwean people and will continue with its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support to the population, in particular those in social sectors, which are not affected by these measures.\nThe European Union desires to pursue the dialogue with Zimbabwe, on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and hopes that you will do everything you can to restore respect for the essential principles of the Partnership Agreement, thereby enabling all cooperation instruments to be resumed in the near future.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
