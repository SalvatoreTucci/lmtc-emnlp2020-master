It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC\u00a0(4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902\u00a011\u00a000 and 1902\u00a019 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93\u00a0(5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 28 April 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 April 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 96.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 5.7.2005, p. 24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.
