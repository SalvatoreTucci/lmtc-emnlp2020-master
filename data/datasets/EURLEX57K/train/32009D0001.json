For the regions of Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Lovech, Pleven, Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo, Russe, Turgovishte, Razgrad, Shumen, Silistra, Dobrich and Varna (i.e. North Bulgaria), the derogation would extend until end 2009. For the areas around the town of Triavna, Blagoevgrad, Pazardjik, Plovdiv, Smolyan, Kurdzhaly, Haskovo, Stara Zagora, Sliven, Yambol, Burgas, Sofia City and Sofia Region (i.e. South Bulgaria), the derogation would extend until end 2010, while Bulgaria would aim to meet its obligations in Sofia City and the Sofia Region in 2009.\n(7) Bulgaria has provided sufficient justification to its derogation request by clarifying, in particular, the need to assign other appropriate frequencies to the current users of the frequency band 2\u00a0500-2\u00a0690 MHz, the importance of migrating all links within a region simultaneously and the need to allocate financial resources to procure new public security mobile communication equipment. A report on the progress of migration and meeting the commitments would help manage the transitional period properly.\n(8) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee indicated at the meeting of the Committee on 2 October 2008 that they do not object to this transitional derogation.\n(9) The requested limitation would not unduly defer implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC nor create undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between Member States. The request is justified and a transitional derogation would be appropriate to facilitate the full implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC,", "main_body": ["Pursuant to its request submitted on 22 October 2008, the Republic of Bulgaria is hereby authorised to postpone the implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC in North Bulgaria until 31 December 2009 and in South Bulgaria until 31 December 2010, subject to the conditions set in Article 3.", "For the purposes of this Decision:\n\u2014 North Bulgaria means the administrative regions of Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Lovech, Pleven, Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo, Russe, Turgovishte, Razgrad, Shumen, Silistra, Dobrich and Varna,\n\u2014 South Bulgaria means the area around the town of Triavna, the region of Sofia, the city of Sofia as well as the administrative regions of Blagoevgrad, Pazardjik, Plovdiv, Smolyan, Kurdzhaly, Haskovo, Stara Zagora, Sliven, Yambol and Burgas.", "Bulgaria shall submit by 16 January 2010 a report on the implementation of Decision 2008/477/EC in North Bulgaria, the city of Sofia and the Region of Sofia and shall submit by 16 January 2011 a report covering its whole territory.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Bulgaria."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 163, 24.6.2008, p. 37."}
