It also lays down additional guarantees as regards specific animal diseases to be provided by certain third countries or parts thereof listed in Annexes I and III thereto and establishes the model health certificates for such imports in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.\n(2) The animal health requirements relating to bluetongue in the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are based on the recommendations of Chapter 8.3 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for animal Health (OIE) which deals with that disease. That Chapter recommends a whole range of risk mitigating measures aiming at either protecting the mammalian host from exposure to the infectious vector or at inactivating the virus by antibodies.\n(3) In addition, the OIE has laid down a Chapter on Surveillance for arthropod vectors of animal diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Those recommendations do not include the monitoring of ruminants for antibodies to Simbu viruses, such as the Akabane and Aino viruses of the Bunyaviridae family, which in the past was considered an economical method for determining the distribution of bluetongue competent vectors until more information on the spread of those diseases became available.\n(4) Also, the OIE does not list Akabane and Aino diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Consequently, the requirement for annual testing for those diseases to prove the absence of the vector should be deleted from Annexes I and III to Decision 2010/472/EU and from the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.\n(5) In addition, the animal health requirements for epizootic haemorrhagic disease in the model health certificates in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are not entirely consistent with the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU of 20 September 2011 on imports into the Union of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species\u00a0(3) and the recommendations of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the OIE. Those model health certificates should therefore be amended to take account of the requirements laid down in Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU and the recommendations of that Manual.\n(6) The Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) To avoid any disruption of trade, the use of health certificates issued in accordance with Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "For a transitional period until 30 June 2013, Member States shall authorise imports from third countries of consignments of:\n(a) semen of animals of the ovine and caprine species which are accompanied by a health certificate issued not later than 31 May 2013 in accordance with the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision.\n(b) ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species accompanied by a health certificate issued not later than 31 May 2013 in accordance with the model health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex IV to Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 14.9.1992, p. 54.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 228, 31.8.2010, p. 74.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 247, 24.9.2011, p. 32.\nANNEX\nThe Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is replaced by the following:\nISO Code Name of the third country Remarks\nDescription of the territory Additional guarantees\nAU Australia  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\nCA Canada  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\nCH Switzerland\u00a0(1)\nCL Chile\nGL Greenland\nHR Croatia\nIS Iceland\nNZ New Zealand\nPM Saint Pierre and Miquelon\nUS United States  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\n(2) in Part 2 of Annex II, Section A is replaced by the following:\n(3) Annex III is replaced by the following:\nISO Code Name of the third country Remarks\nDescription of the territory Additional guarantees\nAU Australia  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.2.6.1 of the model health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex IV is compulsory.\nCA Canada  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.2.6.1 of the model health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex IV is compulsory.\nCH Switzerland\u00a0(2)\nCL Chile\nGL Greenland\nHR Croatia\nIS Iceland\nNZ New Zealand\nPM Saint Pierre and Miquelon\nUS United States  The additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.2.6.1 of the model health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex IV is compulsory.\n(4) Part 2 of Annex IV is replaced by the following:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Certificates in accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Trade in Agricultural Products as approved by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of the Council, and of the Commission as regards the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation of 4 April 2002 on the conclusion of seven Agreements with the Swiss Federation (OJ L 114, 30.4.2002, p. 1).\u2019\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Certificates in accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Trade in Agricultural Products as approved by Decision 2002/309/EC.\u2019"}
