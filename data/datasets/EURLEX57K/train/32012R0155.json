Both cover apparatus with a microprocessor-based device incorporating a modem for gaining access to the Internet, and having a function of interactive information exchange, capable of receiving television signals, so-called \u2018set-top boxes which have a communication function\u2019. According to the wording of the subheadings the apparatus include apparatus incorporating a device performing a recording or reproducing function, provided that they retain the essential character of a set-top box which has a communication function.\n(2) In the interest of legal certainty it is necessary to clarify the scope of those new subheadings with regard to the terms \u2018modem\u2019 and \u2018interactive information exchange\u2019.
