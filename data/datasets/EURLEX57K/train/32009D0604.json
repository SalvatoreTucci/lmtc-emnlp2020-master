09\n1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basic act\nPilot project within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1525/2007\u00a0(2).\n1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General objectives of the pilot project\nThe budget authority has provided the Commission with an appropriation to fund a pilot project which aims to expand our knowledge on the indoor air quality of schools and childcare settings.\nIndoor air quality has been in the past given less attention in terms of research than outdoor air quality, even if research in the latter area is applicable to indoor air in some cases. Also, there is already a comprehensive framework of legislation concerning outdoor air, whereas indoor air regulation is made up of scattered initiatives and pieces of legislation. Indoor air quality in schools has furthermore been much less studied than indoor air quality in other indoor environments. As about 20\u00a0% of the population of the EU spends a long period of time each day in schools and incidences of asthma and other respiratory diseases are growing rapidly in Europe, especially for children, the project is intended to:\n\u2014 identify and analyse indoor air problems in schools, focusing on ventilation, building construction, maintenance and cleaning,\n\u2014 evaluate the effectiveness of appropriate ventilation to reduce ambient air pollution in schools settings,\n\u2014 assess the impact of the changing climate (increased frequency of heat waves, cold waves and ambient air pollutants) in schools on children\u2019s health,\n\u2014 assess the impacts of outdoor air pollution abatement measures, including measures taken in the short term, on indoor air quality in schools and on the children\u2019s exposure in school environments,\n\u2014 provide appropriate recommendations to tackle indoor air quality problems within school environments.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific priorities for 2009\n1. Carry out indoor measurements in schools, in order to produce new data on concentrations of key indoor pollutants in schools.\n2. Assess the association of transport (traffic) and the impact of climate change on school environments.\n3. Assess the health effects of exposure to indoor air pollutants in children and make recommendations for preventing and reducing respiratory diseases by improving the quality of school environments and by other related measures.\n4. Make a systematic source apportionment of indoor air pollutants in school environments in quantitative terms. Identification of the main sources would help their mitigation. In this context, enhancing our understanding of chemical emissions from consumer products and building materials is a priority.\n5. Study the mechanisms of chemical and biochemical interaction in the indoor air mixtures typically found in schools and in different geographical latitudes and develop the methodology to better inform the health risk assessment process as to the effect of such interactions on final health risk.\n6. Based on the above, develop European guidelines for healthy European schools.\nIn the past, two projects related to the same topic have already been supported by the Commission and Parliament:\n\u2014 In 2001, the Commission supported a project on respiratory health in schools in five European cities in Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden. The project\u2019s findings revealed common problems such as poor ventilation, high presence of particulates, moulds and allergens. It concluded that a similar study covering all the Member States would be extremely worthwhile\u00a0(3).\n\u2014 In 2008, a pilot project on exposure to indoor air chemicals and possible health risks, which was financed by the European Parliament, was officially presented. Its analysis also included schools and kindergartens in cities across selected EU Member States. Key findings highlight the need for further research to address the burden of indoor air pollution on public health (in particular in indoor environments where children frequently stay, e.g. schools and kindergartens) in the European Union\u00a0(4).\n\u2014 In 2009, in view of the budget available, it was concluded that the pilot project should have a wider geographical coverage across EU Member States, with a particular emphasis on new Member States. Candidate countries and central and eastern European countries are to be included as well. The objective is to produce guidelines on remedial measures to cover a wider array of situations in Europe.\n\u2014 The pilot project should build on previous projects and create synergy with existing projects in the field (e.g. HITEA)\u00a0(5).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TYPE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT: CALL FOR TENDERS\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breakdown of resources between strands/actions to be implemented (see sections hereunder)\nTotal available amount: EUR\u00a04\u00a0000\u00a0000. A single global service contract will be awarded as a result of a public call for tenders.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expected results of actions to be supported\nThe aim of the call is to gain more knowledge of the indoor air quality of schools as children, who are particularly vulnerable to pollutants, spend most of their time in school environments. Additionally, the aim of the study is to gather knowledge of the numerous situations that could arise in school settings throughout Europe. The study will subsequently provide a guideline aimed at covering various situations with a view to creating healthy school environments.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indicative timetable\nCall for tenders By the end of first semester 2009\nSelection and signature of the contract By the end of 2009\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 27.12.2007, p. 9.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/pollution/pollution_2002_04_en.htm\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://www.bookshop.europa.eu/eubookshop/download.action?fileName=LBNA23087ENC_002.pdf&eubphfUid=582569&catalogNbr=LB-NA-23087-EN-C\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0HITEA: Health effects of indoor pollutants: integrating microbial, toxicological and epidemiological approaches. http://www.hitea.eu/"}
