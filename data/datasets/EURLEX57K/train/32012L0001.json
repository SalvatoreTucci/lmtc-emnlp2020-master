Those studies have also shown the need to reduce the presence of wild or red-grain plants in fields where seed of Oryza sativa is produced, since under the current threshold the yield and quality of rice seed are significantly decreased.\n(2) In view of that, a threshold for the presence of plants infected by Fusarium fujikuroi, in fields where seed of Oryza sativa is produced, should be introduced and the threshold for the presence of wild or red-grain plants, in fields where seed of Oryza sativa is produced, should be reduced for the production of the category of certified seed. Those thresholds should be set on the basis of the studies carried out by Members States.\n(3) Directive 66/402/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 66/402/EEC\nIn Annex I to Directive 66/402/EEC, point 3.A. is replaced by the following:\n\u2018A.
