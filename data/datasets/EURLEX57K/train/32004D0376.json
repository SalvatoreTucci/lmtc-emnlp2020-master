However it is necessary to draw the attention to the existence of standard EN60601-2-38 \"Particular requirements for the safety of electrically operated hospital beds\" in relation with EN1970: 2000,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 1970:2000 \"Adjustable beds for disabled persons - Requirements and test methods\", adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 21 June 2000 and published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 14 November 2001, shall not be withdrawn from the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
