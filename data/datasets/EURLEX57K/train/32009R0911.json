That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M as a feed additive for salmonids and shrimps, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that micro-organism preparation has been authorised without a time limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(2) for chickens for fattening and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2036/2005\u00a0(3) for pigs for fattening.\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for salmonids and shrimps. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 1 April 2009\u00a0(4) that the preparation of Pediococcus acidilactici CNCM MA 18/5M does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that the use of that preparation can have beneficial effects, increasing the number of well-conformed salmonids and improving survivability and growth performance in shrimps. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018other zootechnical additives\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0195, 27.7.2005, p.\u00a06.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0328, 15.12.2005, p.\u00a013.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2009) 1038, p.\u00a02 and 1037, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
