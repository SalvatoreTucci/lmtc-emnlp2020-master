This is a traditional name which, in accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, is considered a designation of origin fulfilling the same conditions as those for a protected designation of origin. The name \u2018Picodon\u2019 is the shortened common form, traditionally used in trade and in normal speech to identify the product obtained in accordance with the specification.\n(3) The amendments made also provide more detail as regards the definition and practices used by the producers when manufacturing the product. The formal inclusion in the specification is intended to protect the designation from potential abuse and to make it more distinctive by strengthening the link to its origin. Lastly, the name of the national Decree protecting the designation has been updated.\n(4) Since the amendments in question are not minor within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission published the amendment application in the Official Journal of the European Union\n\u00a0(3), as required by the first subparagraph of Article 6(2) of that Regulation. As no statement of objection in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 has been sent to the Commission, the amendments should be approved,", "main_body": ["The amendments to the specification published in the Official Journal of the European Union regarding the name in the Annex to this Regulation are hereby approved.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 21.6.1996, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 74, 28.3.2009, p. 74.\nANNEX\nAgricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty:\nClass 1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cheeses\nFRANCE\nPicodon (PDO)"}
