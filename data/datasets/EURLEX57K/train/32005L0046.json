This Decision provides that plant protection products containing this active substance shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community except for a limited number of uses, where at the moment no alternatives are available (essential uses).\n(2) Decision 2004/141/EC allowed a phasing out period, and it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community, should not apply until the end of the phasing out period applying to that substance.\n(3) For amitraz MRLs for residues resulting from veterinary medicinal uses have been set on animal products in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 2377/90\u00a0(6). It is appropriate to take these into account in this Directive.\n(4) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius\u00a0(7) are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for amitraz. These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established.\n(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend several of the pesticide residues arising from use of amitraz in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.\n(7) The relevant annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following row is replaced:\nPesticide residue Maximum level in mg/kg\n\u2018Amitraz including the metabolites containing the 2,4-dimethylaniline moiety expressed as amitraz 0,05\u00a0(8) cereals", "In part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are replaced:\nPesticide residue Maximum level (mg/kg)\nOf meat, including fat, preparations of meat, offals and animal fats as listed in Annex I within CN code Nos 0201, 0202, 0203, 0204, 0205\u00a000\u00a000, 0206, 0207, ex02\u00a008, 0209\u00a000, 0210, 1601\u00a000 and 1602 For milk and milk products listed in Annex 1 within CN code Nos 0401, 0402, 0405\u00a000 and 0406 Of shelled fresh eggs, for bird\u2019s eggs and egg yolks listed in Annex 1 within CN code Nos 0407\u00a000 and 0408\n\u2018Amitraz including the metabolites containing the 2,4-dimethylaniline moiety expressed as amitraz 0,05\u00a0(9), Poultry  0,01\u00a0(9)", "The maximum pesticide residue levels for amitraz in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC are replaced by those in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 January 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
