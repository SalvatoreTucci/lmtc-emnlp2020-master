The total capacity of a Member State\u2019s fleet as expressed in the licences issued may not exceed those limitations and in particular the levels arising from the application of Commission Regulations (EC) No 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003 laying down implementing rules on the Community Fleet Policy as defined in Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002\u00a0(3) and (EC) No 2104/2004 of 9 December 2004 laying down detailed implementing rules for Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions.\n(3) With regard to the importance of the fishing licence as an instrument for both fleet management and control and inspection of fishing activities, Member States must ensure that the information contained in the licence is clear and unambiguous and corresponds at all times to the actual situation.\n(4) According to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the fishing licence must be withdrawn by a Member State in order for the vessel to be withdrawn from the fleet with public aid. The capacity corresponding to that licence cannot be replaced. On the other hand, if the withdrawal of a vessel has not benefited from public aid, the capacity and the capacity licence are replaceable as long as the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on reference levels and the entry/exit regime of the fleet are respected.\n(5) The information contained in the licence should correspond to the information contained in the Community fishing fleet register.\n(6) The information included in the licence should be set out in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 of 30 December 2003 on the Community fishing fleet register\u00a0(5).\n(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 3690/93\u00a0(6) established a Community system laying down rules for the minimum information to be contained in fishing licences.
