The specific provisions applicable to certain groups of foods for particular nutritional uses are laid down by specific Directives.\n(2) Commission Directive 91/321/EEC of 14 May 1991 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae\u00a0(2) is a specific Directive adopted pursuant to Directive 89/398/EEC. Directive 91/321/EEC lays down compositional requirements for infant formulae.\n(3) The Commission received a application for the placing on the market of an innovative infant formula based on hydrolysates of whey protein derived from cows\u2019 milk with a protein content below the minimum of 0,56\u00a0g protein/100\u00a0kJ (2,25\u00a0g protein/100\u00a0kcal), as referred to in point 2.2 of Annex I to Directive 91/321/EEC.\n(4) On 5 October 2005, the European Food Safety Authority delivered its opinion\u00a0(3). That opinion stated that infant formula, based on hydrolysates of whey protein derived from cows\u2019 milk with a protein content of 0,47\u00a0g/100\u00a0kJ (1,9\u00a0g/100\u00a0kcal), is safe and suitable for use as the sole source of nutrition of infants.\n(5) Accordingly, pending the amendment of Directive 91/321/EEC, the marketing of that infant formula should be authorised for a two-year period.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["By the way of derogation from Article 2 and Article 4(1) of Directive 91/321/EEC, the placing on the market of infant formulae based on hydrolysates of cows\u2019 milk, as set out in the Annex to this Regulation, is authorised for a two-year period from the date of adoption of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commisison\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 186, 30.6.1989, p. 27.
