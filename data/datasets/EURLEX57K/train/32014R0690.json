However, since UNSCR 2146 (2014) allows for the entry into ports of designated vessels in certain cases, port fees, including with regard to crude oil aboard such vessels, may be accepted in those cases.\n(5) For reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to amend the list of designated vessels to which those measures apply pursuant to amendments of Annex V to Decision 2011/137/CFSP and on the basis of determinations made by the Sanctions Committee under paragraphs 11 and 12 of UNSCR 2146 (2014).\n(6) On 23 June 2014, Decision 2011/137/CFSP was amended by Council Decision 2014/380/CFSP\u00a0(3) to give effect to those measures.\n(7) Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, the following points are added:\n\u2018(h) \u201cdesignated vessels\u201d means vessels designated by the Sanctions Committee as referred to in paragraph 11 of UNSCR 2146 (2014), as listed in Annex V to this Regulation;\n(i) \u201cthe Government of Libya focal point\u201d means the focal point appointed by the Government of Libya as notified to the Sanctions Committee in accordance with paragraph 3 of UNSCR 2146 (2014).\u2019;\n(2) the following Article is inserted:\n(3) Article 15 is replaced by the following:\n(a) amend Annex IV on the basis of information supplied by Member States;\n(b) amend Annex V pursuant to amendments of Annex V to Decision 2011/137/CFSP and on the basis of determinations made by the Sanctions Committee under paragraphs 11 and 12 of UNSCR 2146 (2014).\u2019;\n(4) Annex V is added as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 23 June 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
