Following an expiry review, those measures have been last maintained by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013\u00a0(3).\n(2) By Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000\u00a0(4), the Council imposed anti-dumping measures on imports of PET originating in India. Following an expiry review, those measures have been last maintained by Council Regulation (EC) No 192/2007\u00a0(5). On 24 February 2012, the Commission initiated a subsequent expiry review. By Implementing Decision 2013/226/EU\u00a0(6), the Council rejected the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council implementing regulation maintaining the anti-dumping duty on imports of PET originating in, inter alia, India and, thus, the anti-dumping measures expired.\n(3) In 2000, by Decision 2000/745/EC\u00a0(7), the Commission accepted price undertakings offered in connection with both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings from, inter alia, the Indian companies Pearl Engineering Polymers Limited (\u2018Pearl\u2019) and Reliance Industries Limited (\u2018Reliance\u2019). In 2005, by Decision 2005/697/EC\u00a0(8), the Commission accepted an undertaking from the Indian company South ASEAN Petrochem Limited which, as a result of a merger, changed its name to Dhunseri Petrochem & Tea Limited (\u2018Dhunseri\u2019)\u00a0(9).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF UNDERTAKINGS AND AMENDMENT OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 461/2013\n(4) By Implementing Decision 2014/109/EU\u00a0(10), the Commission withdrew the acceptance of the undertakings offered by the three Indian companies: Dhunseri, Reliance and Pearl. Therefore, Article 1(4) and Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013, together with the Annex to that Regulation, should be repealed. Accordingly, the definitive countervailing duties imposed by Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 should apply to imports of PET produced by the companies Dhunseri, Reliance and Pearl (TARIC additional code A585 for Dhunseri, TARIC additional code A181 for Reliance and TARIC additional code A182 for Pearl),", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(4) and Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 and the Annex to that Regulation are repealed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(5) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 shall be renumbered Article 1(4).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 shall be renumbered Article 2.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.
