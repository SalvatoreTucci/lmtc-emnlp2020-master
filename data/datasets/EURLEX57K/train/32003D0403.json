The rules also provide for seed sampling and testing in accordance with the methods of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA).\n(4) An examination of those rules and the manner in which they are applied in Lithuania has shown that the field inspection of seed-producing crops satisfies the conditions laid down in Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 2002/57/EC. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in Lithuania afford the same assurances as regards the seed's characteristics and the arrangements for its examination, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the Community, provided that further conditions for seed-producing crops and seed produced, in particular in respect of packages marking, are satisfied.\n(5) Lithuania should therefore be granted equivalence in respect of certain species.\n(6) Decision 2003/17/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC the following item is inserted after the item relating to Latvia:\n\">TABLE>\"", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 May 2003.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nG.
