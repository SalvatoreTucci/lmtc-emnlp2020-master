This Directive requires that third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and animal products covered by that Directive submit a residue monitoring plan providing required guarantees. That plan should, at least, include the groups of residues and substances listed in Annex I of that Directive.\n(2) Commission Decision 2011/163/EU\u00a0(2) approves the plans provided for in Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC submitted by certain third countries listed in the Annex to that Decision for the animals and animal products indicated in that list (\u2018the list\u2019).\n(3) Mexico is currently included in the list as regards, inter alia, equine. However, the latest audits carried out by the Commission in Mexico have confirmed serious shortcomings in the capacity of the Mexican authorities to carry out reliable checks and in particular to attest the absence of substances prohibited by Council Directive 96/22/EC\u00a0(3).\n(4) The entry for Mexico as regards equine should therefore be removed from the list.\n(5) Decision 2011/163/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to avoid any disruption to trade, a transitional period should be laid down to cover the relevant consignments from Mexico which were dispatched to the Union before the date of application of this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision will be reviewed by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, in light of the guarantees provided by the Mexican authorities.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,",
