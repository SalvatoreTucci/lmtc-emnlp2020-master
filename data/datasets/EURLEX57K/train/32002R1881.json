This two-year transitional period could be extended to five years subject to acceptance by the relevant Member State of an action plan presented by the producer organisation in order to comply with all requirements provided for by Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for being granted recognition by that Member State.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 defines in Article 13(1) the starting date of the two- and five-year transitional periods as the date of entry into force of the Regulation, namely 21 November 1996. This date is the result of an error; as a matter of fact, eligibility for transitional measures as from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 would have been meaningless since Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 was still in force until 31 December 1996. Instead, the starting date for the transitional periods should have been the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to rectify the error in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. Since the effects of that error could have negatively affected producer organisations having benefitted from the said transitional periods, it is appropriate to apply the corresponding provisions as from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96,", "main_body": ["Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be replaced by: \"1.
