SI base units >PIC FILE= \"T0013330\">\nDefinitions of SI base units:\nUnit of length\nThe metre is the length equal to 1 650 763 773 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p10 and 5d5 of the krypton 86 atom.\n(Eleventh CGPM (1960), resolution 6).\nUnit of mass\nThe kilogram is the unit of mass ; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.\n(Third CGPM (1901), page 70 of the conference report).\nUnit of time\nThe second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.\n(Thirteenth CGPM (1967), resolution 1).\nUnit of electric current >PIC FILE= \"T0013390\">\n(CIPM (1946), resolution 2, approved by the ninth CGPM (1948)).\nUnit of thermodynamic temperature\nThe kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273 716 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\n(Thirteenth CGPM (1967), resolution 4).\nUnit of amount of substance\nThe mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0 7012 kg of carbon 12.\nWhen the mole is used the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles or specified groups of such particles.\n(Fourteenth CGPM (1971), resolution 3).\nUnit of luminous intensity >PIC FILE= \"T0013391\">\n(Sixteenth CGPM (1979), resolution 3).        1.1.1. Special name and symbol of the SI unit of temperature for expressing Celsius temperature >PIC FILE= \"T0013331\">\nCelsius temperature t is defined as the difference t = T - T0 between the two thermodynamic temperatures T and T0 where T0 = 273 715 kelvins. An interval of or difference in temperature may be expressed either in kelvins or in degrees Celsius. The unit of \"degree Celsius\" is equal to the unit \"kelvin\".\n1.2. Other SI units        1.2.1. Supplementary SI units >PIC FILE= \"T0013332\">\n(Eleventh CGPM, 1960, resolution 12).\nDefinitions of supplementary SI units:\nPlane angle unit\nThe radian is the plane angle between two radii which, on the circumference of a circle, cut an arc equal in length to the radius.\n(International standard ISO 31 - I, December 1965).\nSolid angle unit\nThe steradian is the solid angle which has its apex at the centre of a sphere and which describes on the surface of the sphere an area equal to that of a square having as its side the radius of the sphere.\n(International standard ISO 31 - I, December 1965).\n1.2.2. Derived SI units\nUnits derived coherently from SI base units and supplementary SI units are given as algebraic expressions in the form of products of powers of the SI base units and/or supplementary SI units with a numerical factor equal to 1.\n1.2.3. Derived SI units having names and symbols >PIC FILE= \"T0013333\">\nUnits derived from SI base units or supplementary units may be expressed in terms of the units listed in Chapter I.\nIn particular, derived SI units may be expressed by the special names and symbols given in the above table ; for example, the SI unit of dynamic viscosity may be expressed as m-1 7 kg  7 s-1 or N  7 s  7 m-2 or Pa  7 s.\n1.3. Prefixes and their symbols used to designate certain decimal multiples and submultiples >PIC FILE= \"T0013334\">\nThe names and symbols of the decimal multiples and submultiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching prefixes to the word \"gram\" and their symbols to the symbol\"g\".\nWhere a derived unit is expressed as a fraction, its decimal multiples and submultiples may be designated by attaching a prefix to units in the numerator or the denominator, or in both these parts.\nCompound prefixes, that is to say prefixes formed by the juxtaposition of several of the above prefixes, may not be used.\n1.4. Special authorized names and symbols of decimal multiples and submultiples of SI units >PIC FILE= \"T0013335\">\nNote : The prefixes and their symbols listed in 1.3 may be used in conjunction with the units and symbols contained in Table 1.4.\n2. UNITS WHICH ARE DEFINED ON THE BASIS OF SI UNITS BUT ARE NOT DECIMAL MULTIPLES OR SUBMULTIPLES THEREOF >PIC FILE= \"T0013336\">\nNote : The prefixes listed in 1.3 may only be used in conjunction with the names \"grade\" or \"gon\" and the symbol \"gon\".\n3. UNITS DEFINED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SEVEN SI BASE UNITS\nThe unified atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the mass of an atom of the nuclide 12C.\nThe electronvolt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron passing in a vacuum from one point to another whose potential is one volt higher. >PIC FILE= \"T0013337\">\nThe value of these units, expressed in SI units, is not known exactly.\nThe above values are taken from CODATA Bulletin No 11 of December 1973 of the International Council of Scientific Unions.\nNote : The prefixes and their symbols listed in 1.3 may be used in conjunction with these two units and with their symbols.\n4. UNITS AND NAMES OF UNITS PERMITTED IN SPECIALIZED FIELDS ONLY >PIC FILE= \"T0013338\">\n5. COMPOUND UNITS\nCombinations of the units listed in Chapter I form compound units.\nCHAPTER II LEGAL UNITS OF MEASUREMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 1 (b)\nQUANTITIES, NAMES OF UNITS, SYMBOLS AND VALUES\n>PIC FILE= \"T0013339\">  Note : The prefixes and their symbols listed in 1.3 of Chapter I may be used in conjunction with the units and symbols contained in this section, with the exception of millimetre of mercury and its symbol and the symbol \"g\".\nUntil the date indicated in Article 1 (b), the units listed in Chapter II may be combined with each other or with those in Chapter I to form compound units.\nCHAPTER III LEGAL UNITS OF MEASUREMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 1 (c)\nQUANTITIES, NAMES OF UNITS, SYMBOLS AND APPROXIMATE VALUES\n>PIC FILE= \"T0013340\">  Until the date to be fixed under Article 1 (c), the units listed in Chapter III may be combined with each other or with those in Chapter I to form compound units."}
