The fishing vessels to which this requirement applies should therefore be clearly specified in Annexes IV and V to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording Member States' catches of fish(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2737/1999(4).\n(2) Annex VIIIa to Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 lists the radio stations through which Community fishing vessels transmit certain messages.
