Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001 stipulates that those rules must apply from 1 November 2001.\n(2) The creation of national measures corresponding to the new rules on hemp imports requires major national legislative, administrative and practical changes. As a result, some Member States may not be able to guarantee application of the new rules on the envisaged date, 1 November 2001. The Member States should be granted sufficient extra time to ensure that the rules enter into force at the same time and in the same way, so a new date of 1 May 2002 should be set for application of the new rules. As a consequence, the control measures in force prior to the former date must continue in application until 30 April 2002.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001, the date \"1 November 2001\" is replaced by \"1 May 2002\" and the date \"31 October 2001\" is replaced by \"30 April 2002\".", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 16.\n(2) OJ L 150, 6.6.2001, p. 17.\n(3) OJ L 35, 6.2.2001, p. 18."}
