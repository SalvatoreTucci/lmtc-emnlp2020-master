That method can take the form of an actual fall in price of the financial instrument, of an increase in the yield of a debt instrument issued by a corporate issuer or an increase in the yield across the yield curve for debt instruments issued by sovereign issuers.\n(2) This Regulation should be read in conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 918/2012\u00a0(3), which defines thresholds for the significant fall in value of illiquid shares, debt instruments issued by sovereign and corporate issuers, exchange-traded funds, money market instruments and derivatives whose sole underlying financial instrument is traded on a trading venue. This Regulation should therefore restrict itself to specifying the method of calculation of the significant fall in value of these instruments.\n(3) In order to ensure consistency and legal certainty for market participants and competent authorities, the date of application of this Regulation should be the same as that of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0236/2012 and Delegated Regulation (EU) No 918/2012.\n(4) Since Regulation (EU) No\u00a0236/2012 recognised that binding technical standards should be adopted before that Regulation can be usefully applied, and as it is essential to specify before 1 November 2012 the required non-essential elements to facilitate compliance by market participants with that Regulation and enforcement by competent authorities, it is necessary that this Regulation should enter into force on the day following its publication.\n(5) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.\n(6) ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This
