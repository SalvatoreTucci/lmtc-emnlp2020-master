By 31 December 1996 at the latest, the fishing effort of the  fleets of Sweden and Finland, must have decreased by at least:\n- 8 % for trawlers bottom-trawling for demersal stocks,\n- 6 % for dredgers and beam trawlers targeting benthic stocks,\n- 0 %, i.e. no growth, for the other fleet segments,\nas compared with the estimated situation of the fleet on 1 January 1995.\n2. At least 55 % of the effort reductions referred to in paragraph 1 must be purely by capacity  reductions.", "The implementation of the objectives and procedures referred to in Article 1 shall be  ensured by the Commission, which shall, within three months of the adoption of this Decision, adopt  a multiannual guidance programme for both Finland and Sweden for the period running from 1 January  1995 to 31 December 1996 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5 (2) of Council  Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 of 21 December 1993 laying down the criteria and arrangements regarding  Community structural assistance in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and the processing and  marketing of its products (1).\nThe Commission shall take care, as far as possible, to apply the general provisions of the  multiannual guidance programmes to the fleets of Finland and Sweden and particularly the  segmentation principles and formulae for the calculation of the objectives.", "Articles 3 and 4 of Decision 94/15/EC shall apply to Finland and Sweden.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1995.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
