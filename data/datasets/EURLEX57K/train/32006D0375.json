In such a very small system, it is often not possible to have more than one generating facility per island, which makes the presence of competing generators very impractical. The size of the market will hardly stimulate the application for authorisations or bids for tenders; in addition the level of consumption fluctuates widely: the infrastructures need to be sized according to the maximum demand, which is much higher than the average one. In other words in such peculiar electric systems, security and quality of supply issues have absolute priority. Finally, there is no high voltage transmission system, and without competition in production the Directive\u2019s requirements regarding the unbundling of distribution systems lose their justification. The same considerations are valid concerning third party access to the system.\n(6) The Commission, having examined the justification of Portugal's request, is satisfied that the derogation and the conditions for its application will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of the Directive.\n(7) However, possible technological developments in the medium and long term that may bring about substantial changes need to be taken into account.\n(8) The Commission has consulted all Member States as prescribed in Article 26(1) of Directive 2003/54/EC,", "main_body": ["A derogation from the relevant provisions of Chapters IV, V, VI, VII, as well as Chapter III, as far as refurbishing, upgrading and expansion of existing capacity are concerned, is granted to the Republic of Portugal for the isles of the archipelago of Madeira.", "The Portuguese national authorities shall monitor the evolution of the electricity sector of Madeira and report to the Commission any substantial change therein that may require the review of the granted derogation. A first report shall be submitted four years after the date of this decision and a second one nine years after that date.", "This derogation is valid for an indefinite period of time. It can be reviewed by the Commission if substantial changes occur in the electricity sector of Madeira.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Portugal."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 May 2006.\nFor the Commission\nAndris PIEBALGS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37."}
