(2)OJ No L 16, 20.1.1978, p. 23.\nuniform in certain characteristics (Article 15 (3) (a), third case, of the said Directive);\nWhereas therefore the application of the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full;\nWhereas in respect of the other cases it is not possible to complete examination of the varieties Carmen (creeping bent grass), Tamara (red fescue), Angela, Pablo, Pippin (perennial ryegrass), Orna (smooth stalk meadow grass) and Sverre (lucerne) before expiry of the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive;\nWhereas it consequently seems desirable to extend for the Federal Republic of Germany the period in question for an appropriate time to permit a full examination of the request for those varieties (Article 15 (7) of the said Directive);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["The Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorized to prohibit the marketing in its territory of seed of the following varieties listed in the 1979 common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species:  I.
