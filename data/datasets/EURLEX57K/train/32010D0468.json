(hereinafter \u2018A. strigosa\u2019) as an independent species to be included in the list of species covered by Directive 66/402/EEC.\n(2) A. strigosa is a crop proved to be among the most effective in reducing soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, in particular leaching of nitrates from agricultural sources, and it is an important component of seed mixtures for forage purposes. According to the information provided by the authorities of 6 Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal), the demand for seed of this species has in the last years increased considerably in the Union and in particular in these Member States.\n(3) Before the entry into force of Directive 2009/74/EC and the subsequent listing of A. strigosa among the species covered by Directive 66/402/EEC, the supply of the market was ensured by national production and mainly by the import from third countries of seed of this species in accordance with national legislation applicable at that time. Following the inclusion of A. strigosa in the list of the species covered by Directive 66/402/EEC, only seed of varieties registered in the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species may be marketed and imported.\n(4) Since the inclusion of the species A. strigosa among the list of species covered by Directive 66/402/EEC, only two varieties of that species have been registered in the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species.\n(5) In the light of these circumstances, temporary difficulties in the general supply of A. strigosa have occurred and are expected to continue. These difficulties cannot be overcome otherwise than through Member States permitting, for a specified period and subject to an appropriate maximum quantity, the marketing of varieties of A. strigosa not included in the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species or in the national catalogues of varieties of the Member States.\n(6) Member States should therefore be authorised to temporarily permit the marketing of such seed, subject to certain conditions and limitations and without prejudice to the more stringent provisions concerning the presence of Avena fatua in cereal seed which Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may apply pursuant to the relevant Commission Decisions.\n(7) It appears from the information provided to the Commission by the Member States that, in total, a quantity of 4\u00a0970 tonnes is necessary to resolve these supply difficulties (Belgium 300 tonnes, France 3\u00a0700 tonnes, Germany 200 tonnes, Italy 220 tonnes, Spain 300 tonnes and Portugal 250 tonnes), for a period expiring on 31 December 2010. To ensure that this seed is of sufficient quality it should meet at least the requirements laid down in Annex II to Directive 66/402/EEC as regards germination, analytical purity and content of seeds of other plant species for the category certified seed, 2nd generation of A. strigosa.\n(8) It is appropriate that one Member State acts in order to ensure that the quantity of seed authorised for marketing by the Member States pursuant to this Decision does not exceed the total maximum quantity of 4\u00a0970 tonnes that is necessary to resolve the supply difficulties. In line with the requests of the six Member States, France should therefore act as single coordinator. In order to ensure the good functioning of the system set out by this Decision, it is further necessary that the coordinating Member State, the other Member States and the Commission immediately share the relevant information regarding applications and the granting of authorisations for marketing.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The marketing in the Union of seed of varieties of A. strigosa not included in the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species or in the national catalogues of varieties of the Member States shall be permitted, for a period expiring on 31 December 2010 and subject to the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total quantity of seed authorised for marketing in the Union pursuant to this Decision shall not exceed 4\u00a0970 tonnes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The seed referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the requirements laid down in Annex II to Directive 66/402/EEC as regards the conditions concerning germination, analytical purity and content of seeds of other plant species to be satisfied by the seed for the category certified seed, 2nd generation of A. strigosa.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to any labelling requirement of Directive 66/402/EEC, the official label shall contain the statement that the seed in question is of a category satisfying less stringent requirements than those laid down by that Directive, and that this category is lower than the category certified seed, 2nd generation.

The coordinating Member State shall immediately inform that Member State as to whether and to what extent granting authorisation for marketing upon that application would result in the total maximum quantity of seed being exceeded.", "Member States shall immediately notify the Commission and the other Member States of the quantities in respect of which they have granted authorisation for marketing pursuant to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 August 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 125, 11.7.1966, p.\u00a02309/66.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0166, 27.6.2009, p.\u00a040."}
