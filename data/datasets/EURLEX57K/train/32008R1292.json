That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) From the Opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 16 July 2008\u00a0(2) it results that, on the basis of the data provided by the manufacturer, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it is efficacious in stabilising the gut flora. The Authority further concluded that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on chicken for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the safety and efficacy of Ecobiol\u00ae (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) as feed additives for chickens for fattening.
