Principle\nA weighed quantity of the pellets are dispersed in cold water, without undergoing any further physical treatment which would result in their size reduction, or any structural modification. The resulting material is sieved using a large quantity of cold water and the residue retained on the sieve is dried and weighed.\nThe amount of product passing through the sieve (Z) is expressed as a percentage by mass of the sample, corrected to take account of the moisture content.\n2. Apparatus\n2.1. analytical balance;\n2.2. glass beaker, 1 1;\n2.3. woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2 mm;\n2.4. filter paper, dried;\n2.5. drying oven, 40 \u00b0C;\n2.6. drying oven, 103 \u00b0C.\n3. Procedure\nWeigh at least 100 \u00b1 0,1 g of a representative sample of the pellets into the beaker (2.2). Add 800 ml of cold water and allow to stand for at least 16 hours, with occasional gentle stirring.\nTransfer the contents of the beaker to the sieve (2.3) using a large quantity of cold water. Transfer the residue retained on the sieve to a filter paper (2.4), place in the oven (2.5) at 40 \u00b0C and dry overnight. Following the overnight drying, dry the residue in the oven (2.6) at 103 \u00b0C to constant weight.\n4.
