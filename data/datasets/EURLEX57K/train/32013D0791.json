In July 2010, the Council capped this amount to EUR 6\u00a0600\u00a0000\u00a0000 (in 2008 value).\n(4) The European Parliament and the Council set the maximum level of the Euratom commitments for ITER in the Multiannual Financial Framework for the 2014-2020 period at EUR 2\u00a0707\u00a0000\u00a0000 (in 2011 value).\n(5) It is necessary to amend Decision 2007/198/Euratom to allow the financing of the activities of the Joint Undertaking for the 2014-2020 period from the general budget of the European Union and not through the Euratom research and training programmes.\n(6) Third countries which have concluded a cooperation agreement with Euratom in the field of nuclear energy research, including controlled nuclear fusion, that associate their respective research programmes with the Euratom programmes are to contribute to the financing of the activities of the Joint Undertaking. Their contribution should be determined in the respective cooperation agreement with Euratom.\n(7) The 2012 fusion roadmap developed by national fusion laboratories has the ultimate aim of supporting ITER design and construction and demonstrating electricity production by fusion by around the middle of the century. Therefore, in order to fulfil its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should maintain a close working relationship with the European entities implementing this roadmap.\n(8) It is also appropriate to update Decision 2007/198/Euratom as regards the provisions on protection of the Union's financial interests.\n(9) It is appropriate to inform the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of Decision 2007/198/Euratom on the basis of information provided by the Joint Undertaking.\n(10) Decision 2007/198/Euratom should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/198/Euratom is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 4 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph1, point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) as regards the tasks referred to in Article 1(2)(c), in accordance with research and training programmes adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty or through any other decision adopted by the Council.\u2019\n(b) in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added:\n(c) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n(d) paragraph 4 is deleted.\n(2) the following Articles are inserted:", "Entry into force\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 December 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nV.
