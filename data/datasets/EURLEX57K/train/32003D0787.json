These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. They have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in the Directive and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant-health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97(3) (\"the Regulation\").\n(3) The expenditure which France, Portugal and Finland have incurred, and which is taken into account in this Decision, relates directly to the matters specified in Article 23(2)(a) and (b) of the Directive.\n(4) The technical information provided for by France, Portugal and Finland has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively; the information has also been considered by the Standing Committee on Plant Health. The Commission has concluded that the conditions for the granting of a financial contribution in Article 23 of the Directive have been met.\n(5) Accordingly, it is appropriate to provide a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure on these programmes.\n(6) The Community financial contribution may cover up to 50 % of eligible expenditure. Excluding the programme for which degression has to be applied in accordance with Article 23(5), third subparagraph, of the Directive, the Community financial contribution for the purposes of this Decision should be 50 %.\n(7) The programme notified by Portugal has already been the subject of Community contributions under Commission Decisions 2001/811/EC(4) and 2002/889/EC(5). An extension of the period in which eradication measures have to take place, as set out in Article 23(5), third subparagraph, of the Directive, has been granted to this existing programme, as the examination of the situation has lead to the conclusion that the objective of these eradication measures is likely to be achieved within a reasonable period. The Community financial contribution for this programme has been progressively reduced in accordance with Article 23(5), third subparagraph.\n(8) The contribution referred to in Article 2 of this Decision is without prejudice to further actions taken or to be taken and necessary for the achievement of the objective of eradication or control of the relevant harmful organisms.\n(9) This Decision is without prejudice to the outcome of the verification by the Commission under Article 24 of the Directive on whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and the consequences of such verification.\n(10) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999(6), veterinary and plant-health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Financial control of these measures comes under Articles 8 and 9 of the above Regulation, without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 and Article 23(8) and (9) of the Directive.\n(11) The measures provided in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The allocation of a Community financial contribution to cover expenditure incurred by France, Portugal and Finland relating directly to necessary measures as specified in Article 23(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC and taken for the purpose of combating the organisms concerned by the eradication programmes listed in the Annex to this Decision, is hereby approved.", "1.
