These common rules define the procedures to be adopted for the requesting, preparing and the granting of European technical approvals as expressed in Annex II.3 of the Council Directive 89/106/EEC\u00a0(1) of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products, hereafter referred to as the Directive (CPD).\n0.2. EOTA is an organization established under the provisions of the Directive bringing together the bodies nominated by the Member States of the European Community for the granting of the European technical approvals (ETA) as provided for within its scope.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General rules\n1.1. The Secretariat of EOTA holds the updated list of the issued ETAs. A list is published at least once a year.\n1.2. The Technical Board of EOTA is responsible for creating such committees as are required to arrange and coordinate the production of ETAs.\n1.3. The approval bodies publish the ETAs issued by them in their respective official language(s).\n1.4. Difficulties arising in relation to the Directive which cannot be resolved by the Executive Commission of EOTA will be sent to the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter called \u2018the Commission of the EC\u2019) for resolution.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rules relating to the application for an ETA\n2.1. An application for a European technical approval may be made by a manufacturer, or an agent established in the Community, hereafter referred to as the applicant. The agent must be specifically nominated by the manufacturer to act on his behalf.\n2.2. The application must be made to anyone of the EOTA bodies, which are responsible for the relevant area; however, it is not allowed to direct an application for the same construction product to more than one body.\n2.3. By his application according to this rule the applicant authorizes the approval body to whom he has directed his application to inform the EC Commission, the other EOTA bodies and the Secretariat of EOTA of the content of the application.\n2.4. Before submitting his application the applicant shall \u2014 on his request \u2014 receive, after supplying such information as is required by the approval body, information concerning:\n\u2014 the approval procedure,\n\u2014 the estimate of the time schedule necessary for the approval body to complete the approval procedure for the specific product,\n\u2014 an estimate of the cost for the handling of the approval procedure and the payment modalities.\n2.5. The application must be submitted in a standard format (see Appendix 1) in the language of the Member State where the approval body is located unless agreed otherwise by the approval body.\n2.6. The application shall be accompanied by a description of the construction product, specifications, drawings and test reports, explaining in detail the subject under application and its intended use.\n2.7. In the application from the applicant shall announce all the places of manufacture. He has to ensure that these places can be visited by the approval body or its representative during working hours, in view of the issuing of the ETA.\n2.8. The approval body has to, within two months, acknowledge receipt of the application and confirm that it will initiate the procedures (see standard format Appendix 2).\n2.9. The approval body has to inform the applicant which documents, test results, calculations, etc he has to deliver to enable the approval body to assess the fitness for use of the product for the intended use.\n2.10. The EOTA bodies shall take the necessary measures to ensure confidentiality of all critical information which, in the course of their activities, comes to their knowledge.\n2.11. The applicant has to declare, in a legally binding way, that he will pay all the costs arising from the approval procedure and the establishment of the supporting documents in accordance with national rules.\n2.12. If the applicant does not meet his obligations as defined in this document, the approval body may, after a reasonable period of time, cancel the application.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rules relating to the granting of an ETA\n3.0. The ETA only concerns aspects of the product which relate to the essential requirements as defined in Annex I of the CPD and in the Interpretative Documents according to Article 3.3 of the CPD. Only these aspects are related to the CE marking.\n3.1.1. The content and format of the ETA must correspond to the relevant ETA guideline.\n3.1.2. The approval body which issues the ETA sends it to:\n\u2014 all other EOTA bodies,\n\u2014 the General Secretariat who will send a copy to the Commission of the EC.\n3.1.3. During a transitional period determined individually for each ETA guideline by EOTA, in order to ensure the comparability of the ETAs issued by the approval bodies, the draft ETA with the accompanying documents (test results) are submitted for prior consultation to the relevant EOTA bodies\u00a0(2) and the General Secretariat asking for their comments within two months.\n3.1.4. Should the Commission of the EC establish, under provisions of Article 5. 1 of the CPD and after the advice of the Standing Committee, a shortcoming in a given ETA due to a shortcoming of an ETA guideline, the approval bodies shall not issue any more ETAs on the basis of the above ETA guideline.\n3.2.1. The content and format of the ETA must correspond to the \u2018general format\u2019 agreed by the Commission of the EC.\n3.2.2. The approval body receiving a request according to point 2.4 or an application for an ETA introduced for the first time for a product of the family concerned must have preliminary consultation with the Technical Board in order that it can agree in principle on the granting of an ETA to that product and on the principle of the proposed attestation of conformity procedure.\n3.2.3. If agreement is achieved under 3.2.2 the approval body to whom an application is directed must have a preliminary discussion with the other relevant EOTA bodies in which is explained the manner it is intended to use to progress the application including the test programme, the performance requirements and the manner of fulfillment of the attestation of conformity foreseen.\n3.2.4. When the application for an ETA is for a product of a family for which the procedure laid down in 3.2.3 has already been established the ETA must be based on that established procedure.\n3.2.5. Before issuing the ETA, the approval body sends the ETA draft to the relevant EOTA bodies and to the General Secretariat with the justifications provided by the applicant asking for their comments within two months.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Withdrawal of an ETA\n4.1. The approval body shall withdraw the ETA if the Commission of the EC has informed the Member States according to Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Directive.\n4.2. The approval body has to inform the other EOTA bodies and the General Secretariat of the withdrawal. The General Secretariat will inform the Commission of the EC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Modification of an ETA\n5.1. For modification of an ETA the procedure of a new application applies accordingly. The application must be addressed to the approval body having issued the approval being subject to modification.\n5.2. The provisions stated under 3.1 and 3.2 have to be applied accordingly: the approval procedure shall only relate to the items directly concerned by the modification.\n5.3. A new ETA is issued replacing the previous ETA.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Extension of validity\n6.1. In accordance with Article 8 (4) of the Directive, the period of validity of an ETA can be extended for a further period of (in general) five years provided that the EC Commission has not notified the concerned approval bodies and/or EOTA that conditions on which the original ETA were issued have changed. Applications shall be submitted in writing and should be received by the approval body at least six months before the expiry date.\n6.2. The application for extension must be accompanied by the relevant technical documents required in the ETA guidelines for the extension of an ETA. If such ETA guidelines do not exist, the approval body after consultation with the EOTA bodies, will inform the applicant which technical documents have to be presented.\n6.3. Such extensions become the responsibility of the body issuing them and should be as complete as the original assessment.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Relevant EOTA bodies: bodies nominated by the Member States to operate in the subject area.\nAppendix 1\nAPPLICATION FOR A EUROPEAN TECHNICAL APPROVAL REFERRED TO IN CHAPTER III OF THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 89/106/EEC\nAppendix 2"}
