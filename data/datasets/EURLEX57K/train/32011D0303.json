The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. That tolerance is defined in Article 23(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(2).\n(2) By Decision 2005/627/EC\u00a0(3), the Commission authorised the use of two methods for grading pig carcasses in the Netherlands.\n(3) Due to technical adaptations and the fact that a change in the Dutch pig population is foreseen as castrated males are expected to be absent in the near future, the Netherlands has requested the Commission to authorise three methods for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which those methods are based, the results of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008.\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those grading methods are fulfilled. Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in the Netherlands.\n(5) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.\n(6) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, Decision 2005/627/EC should be repealed.\n(7) In view of the technical circumstances while introducing new devices and new equations, the methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under this Decision should apply from 3 October 2011.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is hereby authorised for grading pig carcasses pursuant to point 1 of Section B.IV of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in the Netherlands:\n\u2014 the Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 7) apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex,\n\u2014 the Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM) apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex,\n\u2014 the CSB Image-Meater (CSB) apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex.", "Modifications of the authorised apparatus or assessment methods shall not be allowed, unless those modifications are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.", "Decision 2005/627/EC is repealed.", "This Decision shall apply from 3 October 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u015e\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 337, 16.12.2008, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 30.8.2005, p. 17.\nANNEX\nMETHODS FOR GRADING PIG CARCASSES IN THE NETHERLANDS\nPART 1\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP 7)\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 7)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95\u00a0mm diameter (and have abutting 6,3\u00a0mm of blade on either side of the probe at its head) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120\u00a0mm. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean-meat content by means of the HGP 7 itself as well as a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean-meat content of the carcass shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nFat = the HGP7 fat depth measurement (including rind) in millimetres, as measured at the third to fourth rib from last rib position, 6 centimetres from the dorsal midline,\nMuscle = the HGP7 muscle depth measurement (including rind) in millimetres, as measured at the same time and in the same place as Fat.\nPART 2\nCapteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a high-definition Sydel probe 8\u00a0mm in diameter, a light-emitting infra-red diode (Honeywell) and two light sensors (Honeywell). The operating distance shall be between 0 and 95\u00a0mm.\n3. The lean-meat content of carcasses shall be calculated using the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nFat = the CGM fat depth measurement (including rind) in millimetres, as measured at the third to fourth rib from last rib position, 6 centimetres from the dorsal midline,\nMuscle = the CGM muscle depth measurement (including rind) in millimetres, as measured at the same time and in the same place as Fat.\nPART 3\nCSB Image-Meater (CSB)\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018CSB Image-Meater (CSB)\u2019.\n2. The CSB Image-Meater consists in particular of a video camera, a PC equipped with an image-analysis card, a screen, a printer, a command mechanism, a rate mechanism and interfaces. The Image-Meater variables (16) are all measured at the split line in the ham area (around M. gluteus medius):\n3. The lean-meat content of carcasses shall be calculated according to the following formula:\nLMP = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nS = fat depth, minimal fat depth over muscle gluteus medius (mm),\nF = muscle depth, minimal muscle depth between anterior extremity of muscle gluteus medius and the dorsal part of the medullar canal (mm),\nML = length of muscle gluteus medius (mm),\nMS = mean bacon width below muscle gluteus medius (mm),\nMF = mean lean-meat width below muscle gluteus medius (mm),\nWL = mean length of vertebrae including spinal discs (mm),\nWa,b,c,dS = mean bacon width below 1st measured vertebra (a) and three other vertebrae (b, c, d) (mm),\nWa,b,c,dF = mean lean-meat width below 1st measured vertebra (a), and three other vertebrae (b, c, d) (mm),\nES = mean external bacon width above the four measured vertebrae (mm),\nIS = mean internal bacon width above the four measured vertebrae (mm).\n4. The measuring points are described in Part II of the Protocol presented to the Commission by the Netherlands in accordance with Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008."}
