and\n- the Government of the State of Israel, by application dated 24 February 1971;\nWhereas the Chilean Government will ensure that no exports to the Community are effected until the Central Bank has granted its authorisation after verifying that, for the wines in question, the free-at-Community-frontier price is not lower than the corresponding reference price applicable at the time of customs clearance, less customs duties;\nWhereas the Israeli Government will ensure that no exports of wine to the Community are effected until an export licence has been issued by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, after the latter has verified that, for the wines in question, the ruling price is not lower than the corresponding reference price, applicable at the time of customs clearance, less customs duties;\nWhereas furthermore the said Governments will ensure that any deflection of trade will be avoided ; whereas they will make any provisions necessary for this purpose and take all necessary steps to ensure that no action is taken which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the reference prices less customs duties, such as taking over marketing costs, resorting to linked transactions or any other action having similar effect;\nWhereas they undertake to communicate regularly to the Commission details of wine exports to the Community and to enable the Commission to exercise continuous supervision of the effectiveness of the measures they have taken;\nWhereas the Chilean and Israeli Governments have also undertaken to impose appropriate penalties on their exporters in order to ensure compliance with the provisions decided upon;\nWhereas questions affecting observance of the guarantee given have been discussed in detail with the competent authorities of the Republic of Chile and of the State of Israel ; whereas, following these discussions, it may be assumed that Chile and Israel are in a position to abide by their guarantees ; whereas, consequently, there is no need to levy a  1OJ No L 99, 5.5.1970, p. 1. 2OJ No L 170, 29.7.1971, p. 3.\ncountervailing charge on imports of certain products originating in and coming from Chile or from Israel ;
