In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles, inter alia, as regards exports.\n(3) Common rules should therefore be established for exports from the Community.\n(4) Exports are almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore possible to accept as a Community principle that exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction, subject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty.\n(5) The Commission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary.\n(6) It is essential that examination should take place at Community level, in particular on the basis of any such information and within an advisory committee, of export terms and conditions, of export trends, of the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation, and of the measures, if any, to be taken.\n(7) It may become apparent from this examination that the Community should exercise surveillance over certain exports, or that interim protective measures should be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices. The need for rapid and effective action makes it justifiable for the Commission to be empowered to decide upon such measures, but without prejudice to the subsequent position of the Council, whose responsibility it is to adopt a policy consistent with the interests of the Community.\n(8) Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Community should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations.\n(9) It is desirable that Member States be empowered, in certain circumstances and provided that their actions are on an interim basis only, to take protective measures individually.\n(10) It is desirable that while such protective measures are in operation there should be an opportunity for consultation for the purpose of examining the effects of the measures and of ascertaining whether the conditions for their application are still satisfied.\n(11) It is necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international commitments setting up, in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties, a system for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply with the resulting obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, without prejudice to Community provisions adopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the Council of appropriate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the Community or all the Member States.\n(12) This Regulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. Its operation should be complementary to that of the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets, and to that of the special instruments adopted under Article 308 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of these instruments, particularly the protective clauses thereof, must however be avoided,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nBASIC PRINCIPLE", "The exportation of products from the European Community to third countries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nCOMMUNITY INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURE", "If, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures within the meaning of Chapter III might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consultations may be held at any time, either at the request of a Member State or on the initiative of the Commission.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consultations shall take place within 4 working days following receipt by the Commission of the notification provided for in Article 2, and in all cases before the introduction of any measure pursuant to Articles 5 to 7.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consultations shall take place within an advisory committee (hereinafter called \u2018the Committee\u2019), which shall consist of representatives of each Member State with a representative of the Commission as Chairman.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall meet when convened by its Chairman.

They shall not affect products already on their way to the Community frontier.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When quantitative restrictions on exports are introduced, account shall be taken in particular of:\n(a) the volume of goods exported under contracts concluded on normal terms and conditions before the entry into force of a protective measure within the meaning of this Chapter and notified by the Member State concerned to the Commission in conformity with its national laws; and\n(b) the need to avoid jeopardising achievement of the aim pursued in introducing quantitative restrictions.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While any measure referred to in Articles 6 and 7 is in operation, consultations within the Committee shall be held, either at the request of a Member State or on the initiative of the Commission.
