whereas, however, application of the  common commercial policy may in particular be subject to derogations, where appropriate, in respect of vertain sensitive products, to accompany the gradual introduction of the CCT;\nWhereas Council Decision 91/314/EEC of 26 June 1991 setting up a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary Islands (Poseican)(4)  stipulates in particular that at the request, with supporting documents, of the  competent Spanish authorithies, specific measures derogating from the common commercial policy may be considered in respect of certain sensitive products, on a case-by-case basis to take account of particular problems in a given sector of local  production intended for local consumption or tourism, and/or to allow access for consumer goods such as textiles, clothes, optical and electronic equipment or means of transport;\nWhereas, in their letters of July 1991, the competent Spanish authorities requested exemption form the anti-dumping duties applied to imports of certain major consumer electronic goods originating in certain non-member countries; whereas, during the  examination of the request, the same authorities provided an additional list of products to be exempted from anti-dumping duty on import;\nWhereas anti-dumping measures fall within the scope of the common commercial policy; whereas, therefore, temporary derogation from their application to imports of certain prodcuts into the Canary Islands is possible under point 7.1 of the Annex to  Decision 91/314/EEC;\nWhereas the sensitive products which might be covered by the specific measures applied for under point 7.1 of the Annex to Decision 91/314/EEC by the competent Spanish authorities should be determined according to the criteria laid down in that  provision and on the basis of the requests filed; whereas, following case-by-case examination, it appears that then of those products fall within the category of consumer goods for the domestic market, access of which to the Canary Islands should be  allowed through the specific measures; whereas none of the other products in respect of which requests have been filed fulfils the conditions laid down in the said point 7.1; whereas the measures requested are therefore justified in respect of imports  of compact disc players, video cassette recorders, small-screen colour television receivers, audio and video cassettes, electronic typewriters, dot-matrix printers, plain paper photocopiers, car radios and espadrilles, as detailed in Annex I to this  Regulation;\nWhereas the request from the Spanish authorities covered the whole of the transitional period from the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91; whereas for this reason and to ensure continuity during the said period the specific measures  applicable from 1 July 1991 should be established;\nWhereas the said measures may be adopted to accompany the gradual introduction of the CCT in the Canary Islands; whereas it is therefore appropriate to phase out the exemptions, during the transitional period ending on 31 December 2000 provided for  under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91, by gradually applying anti-dumping duties in the Canary Islands, in step with the introduction of the CCT; whereas the request from the Spanish authorities to benefit from total exemption from anti-dumping  duties from 1 July 1991 in respect of the products in question is aimed at ensuring continuity in the way these products are supplied to the Canary Islands und whereas such a request appears to be justified for an initial period endiung on 31 December  1995; whereas at the end of this period, intended to enable operators on the local market to adjust to the new tariff arragements being introduced in the territory of the Canary Islands, anti-dumping duties in respect of the products in question shall  be collected gradually as a percentage of the anti-dumping duties payable on those products in the Community, increasing by 20 % a year from 1996 to become payable in full at the end of the transitional period;\nWhereas point 7.2 of the Annex to Decision 91/314/EEC states that the specific measures adopted in derogation from the common commercial policy in respect of sensitive products must be tailored to the Canary Islands' domestic market to avoid any  deflection of trade; whereas it is therefore appropriate to establish fixed annual quantities for each product in respect of which exemption is granted to ensure that the products are imported solely to cover domestic demand; whereas the said quantities  should be calculated with reference to the volume of customary annual consumption on the islands prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91;\nWhereas responsibility for monitoring compliance with the quantitative limits referred to above should be devolved upon the competent Spanish authorities, who should be asked, nevertheless, to inform the Commission at regular intervals;\nWhereas the limited validity of the anti-dumping measures might result in Annex I to this Regulation being updated; whereas provision should be made to review once a year, at the request of the Spanish authorities, the list of sensitive products in the  said Annex, whereas only products already classified as sensitive under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 temporarily suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products to the Canary Islands(5) , and on imports on  which anti-dumping duties have recently been imposed, may be entered on the said list; whereas the fixed annual quantities for these products shall be calculated with reference to the average annual volume of demand on the Canary Islands before the  anti-dumping duties are imposed; whereas the task of carrying out this periodic review should be entrusted to the Commission, assisted by the Advisory Committee set up under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88(6) ,", "main_body": ["1.
