Those rules cover in particular the obligation for the Member States to use the information systems made available by the Commission and the validation of the access rights of the authorities or individuals authorised to send communications. In addition, that Regulation sets common principles applying to the information systems so that they guarantee the authenticity, integrity and legibility over time of the documents and provides for personal data protection.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 the obligation to use the information systems in accordance with that Regulation has to be provided for in the Regulations establishing a specific notification obligation.\n(3) The Commission has developed an information system that allows to manage documents and procedures electronically in its own internal working procedures and in its relations with the authorities involved in the common agricultural policy.\n(4) It is considered that some notification obligations can now be fulfilled via that system in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 792/2009, in particular those provided for in Commission Regulations (EC) No 2336/2003 of 30 December 2003 introducing certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin\u00a0(3), (EC) No\u00a0341/2007 of 29 March 2007 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas and introducing a system of import licences and certificates of origin for garlic and certain other agricultural products imported from third countries\u00a0(4), (EC) No\u00a01580/2007 of 21 December 2007 laying down implementing rules of Council Regulations (EC) No\u00a02200/96, (EC) No\u00a02201/96 and (EC) No\u00a01182/2007 in the fruit and vegetable sector\u00a0(5) and (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6).\n(5) In Regulations (EC) No 2336/2003 and (EC) No 1580/2007 it is appropriate to require that the notifications should include nil returns. Furthermore, for reasons of clarity, it should be provided that in notifications on replacement licences in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 a reference to the serial number of the replaced licence is also to be given. For an efficient dissemination by the Commission to the Member States of the information received on replacement licences it should be required that this information is notified to the Commission immediately after the issue of the licence. Also for reasons of clarity, the requested information in notifications on cases of force majeure needs to be detailed.\n(6) Regulations (EC) No 2336/2003, (EC) No 341/2007, (EC) No 1580/2007 and (EC) No\u00a0376/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2336/2003 is amended as follows:\n1.
