Moreover, a reasonable amount of time is needed for the situation to be redressed.\n(6) The Commission therefore considers that the suspension measure should be extended for an additional period of six months, insofar as sugar of CN codes 1701 or 1702 declared as originating in Serbia and Montenegro is concerned, in application of Article 12(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.\n(7) The Customs Code Committee has been informed accordingly,", "main_body": ["The preferential arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 for sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 imported from Serbia and Montenegro are suspended for an additional period of six months.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt is applicable from 8 August 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik Bolkestein\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 240, 23.9.2000, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 86, 3.4.2003, p. 18.\n(3) OJ L 109, 1.5.2003, p. 13."}
