Only a very limited part of the territory of France would be concerned; it does not unduly prevent activities around urban areas and the areas involved would be rural and would not overlap with major towns. RFID would still be permitted in the designated areas, albeit with a reduced power level. Overall, the derogation would in effect not significantly impact on the deployment of RFID technology in France.\n(5) The limitation should remain exceptional and be allowed for a limited period of time. France would report on the evolution of technology and usage by its military forces and on the implementation of the limitation after three years. The report would include any fact or measurement during the three year period.\n(6) France has indicated that it would adopt new military equipment which would be compatible with the emission levels of Commission Decision 2006/804/EC as soon as new technology would be available; considering the time necessary for technology development, France has indicated that it may wish to apply for three year-renewals of this derogation, until 2020 at the latest. However, it remains that such derogation is exceptional and any extension thereof should be properly justified and necessary.\n(7) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee have indicated at the meeting of the Committee on 4 and 5 December 2006 that they do not object to this transitional derogation.\n(8) The requested limitation would not unduly defer implementation of Decision 2006/804/EC or create undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between Member States. The request is justified and a transitional derogation would be appropriate to facilitate the full implementation of Decision 2006/804/EC,", "main_body": ["The request by France by letter of 23 February 2007 (SG/CDC/2007/A/1821) to further limit the emission powers for the use of the 865,6-867,6 MHz frequency band for radio frequency identification devices (RFID) operating on the territory of France, as a derogation to Decision 2006/804/EC, is hereby approved, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "In the 865,6-867,6 MHz frequency band, the maximum power/field strength shall not be higher than 500 mW effective radiated power (e.r.p.) in the zones as defined in the Annex.", "France shall submit by 30 June 2010 a report on the implementation of this Decision.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2010.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 2007.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 329, 25.11.2006, p. 64.\nANNEX\nGeographical coordinates Department Radius of zone with maximum power/field strength of 500 mW e.r.p.\nAvon-les-Roches 47\u00b0 12\u2032 04\u2033 N \u2014 000\u00b0 28\u2032 48\u2033 E 37 \u2014 Indre-et-Loire 20 km\nBeignon 47\u00b0 56\u2032 56\u2033 N \u2014 002\u00b0 09\u2032 26\u2033 W 56 \u2014 Morbihan 15 km\nBitche 49\u00b0 03\u2032 09\u2033 N \u2014 007\u00b0 28\u2032 43\u2033 E 57 \u2014 Moselle 20 km (only on French territory)\nCaylus 44\u00b0 16\u2032 42\u2033 N \u2014 001\u00b0 44\u2032 57\u2033 E 82 \u2014 Tarn-et-Garonne 20 km\nLa Cavalerie 44\u00b0 00\u2032 40\u2033 N \u2014 003\u00b0 10\u2032 16\u2033 E 12 \u2014 Aveyron 10 km\nLa Courtine 45\u00b0 42\u2032 40\u2033 N \u2014 002\u00b0 15\u2032 18\u2033 E 23 \u2014 Creuse 20 km\nMailly-le-Camp 48\u00b0 39\u2032 55\u2033 N \u2014 004\u00b0 13\u2032 04\u2033 E 10 \u2014 Aube 20 km\nMontferrat 43\u00b0 38\u2032 47\u2033 N \u2014 006\u00b0 28\u2032 05\u2033 E 83 \u2014 Var 10 km\nMourmelon 49\u00b0 07\u2032 30\u2033 N \u2014 004\u00b0 21\u2032 59\u2033 E 51 \u2014 Marne 15 km\nSissonne 49\u00b0 34\u2032 08\u2033 N \u2014 003\u00b0 54\u2032 57\u2033 E 02 \u2014 Aisne 20 km\nSuippes 49\u00b0 07\u2032 37\u2033 N \u2014 004\u00b0 33\u2032 05\u2033 E 51 \u2014 Marne 20 km\nValdahon 47\u00b0 09\u2032 24\u2033 N \u2014 006\u00b0 19\u2032 25\u2033 E 25 \u2014 Doubs 20 km"}
