However, there is a continuing need at Community level for the annual provision of coherent statistical information on the information society domain.\n(2) The European Council of March 2005 stressed the importance of building a fully inclusive information society, based on widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in public services, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and households.\n(3) The European Council of March 2006 recognised the crucial importance of a more productive use of ICTs in businesses and administrative organisations and called on the Commission and the Member States to implement the i2010 strategy vigorously. This strategy promotes an open and competitive digital economy and highlights ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. It is seen as a key factor in the renewed Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs.\n(4) In April 2006 the i2010 High Level Group set up by Commission Decision 2006/215/EC\u00a0(3) endorsed the i2010 benchmarking framework, which sets out a list of key indicators to benchmark the development of the European information society as laid down in the i2010 strategy.\n(5) Decision No\u00a01639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to\u00a02013)\u00a0(4) helps to enhance competitiveness and innovation capacity in the Community, to promote the advancement of the knowledge society, and to foster sustainable development based on balanced economic growth. That Decision requires the Community to equip itself with a sound analytical basis to support policy making in a number of areas. The framework programme established by that Decision supports actions for policy analyses based on official statistics.\n(6) The Ministerial Declaration on e-Inclusion, which was adopted in Riga on 11\u00a0June 2006, calls for an inclusive information society. It sets the framework for a comprehensive policy on e-Inclusion, addressing issues in the fields of the ageing society, the geographical digital divide, accessibility, digital literacy and competences, cultural diversity and inclusive online public services. It invites the Commission to support evidence gathering and benchmarking within and outside the European Union.\n(7) The indicators for benchmarking the development of the information society as expressed in the political strategies of the Community, such as the i2010 benchmarking framework of the i2010 strategy and its further developments under the Lisbon strategy, should be based on coherent statistical information.\n(8) The amendment of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0808/2004 should take into account Regulation (EC) No\u00a0223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\u00a0March 2009 on European statistics\u00a0(5).\n(9) This Regulation should not increase the burden on respondents and national statistical authorities, measured by the number of mandatory variables or interview duration, in respect of the collection and transmission of harmonised statistics as compared to the situation existing before the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0808/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(6) has been consulted,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0808/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
