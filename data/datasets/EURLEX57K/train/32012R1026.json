This cooperation may be established in the framework of regional fisheries management organisations (\u2018RFMOs\u2019) or, where RFMOs have no competence for the stock in question, by means of ad hoc arrangements among the countries having an interest in the fishery.\n(2) Where a third country with an interest in a fishery involving a stock of common interest to that country and to the Union allows, without due regard to existing fishing patterns or the rights, duties and interests of other countries and the Union, fisheries activities that jeopardise the sustainability of that stock, and fails to cooperate with other countries and the Union in its management, specific measures should be adopted in order to encourage that country to contribute to the conservation of that stock.\n(3) Fish stocks should be considered to be in an unsustainable state when they are not continuously maintained at or above the levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield or, if these levels cannot be estimated, when the stocks are not continuously maintained within safe biological limits.\n(4) It is necessary to define the conditions upon which a country can be considered to be a country allowing non-sustainable fishing and subject to measures under this Regulation, including a process granting the countries concerned the right to be heard and allowing them an opportunity to adopt corrective action.\n(5) In addition, it is necessary to define the type of measures that may be taken with regard to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing and to establish general conditions for the adoption of such measures, so that they are based on objective criteria and are equitable, cost-effective and compatible with international law, in particular with the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation.\n(6) Such measures should aim to remove the incentives for countries allowing non-sustainable fishing to fish the stock of common interest. This can be achieved inter alia by restricting the importation of fish products caught by vessels conducting fisheries on a stock of common interest under the control of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing, by restricting the access to ports for those vessels, or by preventing Union fishing vessels or Union fishing equipment from being used for fishing the stock of common interest under the control of the country allowing non-sustainable fishing.\n(7) In order to ensure that Union action for the conservation of fish stocks is effective and coherent, it is important that the measures set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\u00a0(3) are taken into consideration.\n(8) In order to guarantee that measures adopted against a country under this Regulation are environmentally sound, effective, proportionate and compatible with international rules, it is necessary for their adoption to be preceded by an evaluation of their expected environmental, trade, economic and social effects.\n(9) If measures adopted against a country under this Regulation are ineffective and that country continues to be considered to be a country allowing non-sustainable fishing, further measures may be adopted in accordance with this Regulation.\n(10) The measures adopted against a country under this Regulation should cease to apply when the country allowing non-sustainable fishing has adopted the measures necessary for its contribution to the conservation of the stock of common interest.\n(11) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission with regard to identifying a country allowing non-sustainable fishing, to adopting measures in respect of such country and to deciding that such measures should cease to apply. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers\u00a0(4).\n(12) The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the end of application of measures taken pursuant to this Regulation, imperative grounds of urgency so require,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down a framework for the adoption of certain measures regarding the fisheries-related activities and policies of third countries in order to ensure the long-term conservation of stocks of common interest to the Union and those third countries.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures adopted pursuant to this Regulation may apply in all cases where cooperation between third countries and the Union is required for the joint management of the stocks of common interest, including where that cooperation takes place in the context of an RFMO or a similar body.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018stock of common interest\u2019 means a fish stock the geographical distribution of which makes it available to both the Union and third countries and the management of which requires the cooperation between such countries and the Union, in either bilateral or multilateral settings;\n(b) \u2018associated species\u2019 means any fish that belongs to the same ecosystem as the stock of common interest and that preys upon that stock, is preyed on by it, competes with it for food and living space or co-occurs with it in the same fishing area, and that is exploited or accidentally taken in the same fishery or fisheries;\n(c) \u2018regional fisheries management organisation\u2019 or \u2018RFMO\u2019 means a sub-regional, regional or a similar organisation with competence under international law to establish conservation and management measures for living marine resources placed under its responsibility by virtue of the convention or agreement by which it was established;\n(d) \u2018importation\u2019 means the introduction of fish or fishery products into the territory of the Union, including for transhipment purposes at ports in its territory;\n(e) \u2018transhipment\u2019 means the unloading of all or any fish or fishery products on board a fishing vessel to another fishing vessel;\n(f) \u2018unsustainable state\u2019 means the condition where the stock is not continuously maintained at or above the levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield or, if these levels cannot be estimated, where the stock is not continuously maintained within safe biological limits; the stock levels determining whether the stock is in an unsustainable state are to be determined on the basis of best available scientific advice;\n(g) \u2018safe biological limits\u2019 means the boundaries of the size of a stock within which the stock can replenish itself with high probability while allowing high yield fisheries on it;\n(h) \u2018country\u2019 means a third country, including territories enjoying self-governing status and endowed with competencies in the area of conservation and management of living marine resources.", "Countries allowing non-sustainable fishing\nA country may be identified as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing where:\n(a) it fails to cooperate in the management of a stock of common interest in full compliance with the provisions of the UNCLOS and the UNFSA, or any other international agreement or norm of international law; and\n(b) either:\n(i) it fails to adopt necessary fishery management measures; or\n(ii) it adopts fishery management measures without due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other countries and the Union, and those fishery management measures, when considered in conjunction with measures taken by other countries and the Union, lead to fishing activities which could result in the stock being in an unsustainable state.
