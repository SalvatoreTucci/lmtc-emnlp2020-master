On the basis of those definitions certain grazing livestock farms cannot be classified by type of farming and for other farms the classification obtained is not the most appropriate.\n(2) Annex II, Part B to Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 has laid down rules concerning the grouping of the economic size classes. Those rules limit the possibilities for the Member States to establish more suitable selection plans.\n(3) Some descriptions and names used in Annex I and Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01242/2008 lack legibility and need therefore to be clarified.\n(4) The description and the code of certain products referred to in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01242/2008 and listed in Commission Regulation (EC) No 868/2008 of 3\u00a0September 2008 on the farm return to be used for determining the incomes of agricultural holdings and analysing the business operation of such holdings\u00a0(3) have been amended by Regulation (EC) No 781/2009 of 27 August 2009.\n(5) Furthermore the names of certain types of farming used in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01242/2008 should be corrected in some languages. To improve consistency the word holding should be suppressed from the name of a type of farming and for better legibility certain words related to poultry categories should be replaced in the name of certain types of farming.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data network,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the accounting year 2010 for the Farm Accountancy Data Network and for the farm structure survey as of the 2010 survey.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 109, 23.6.1965, p. 1859/65.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 237, 4.9.2008, p. 18.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I, II and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) Part A.
