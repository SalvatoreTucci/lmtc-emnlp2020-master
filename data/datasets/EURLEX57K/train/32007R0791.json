The measures applying for the period 2003-2006 are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2328/2003\u00a0(3). It is necessary from 2007 to continue measures for offsetting the additional costs for the marketing of certain fishery products on the basis of a report by the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.\n(3) In view of the different marketing conditions in the outermost regions concerned, the fluctuations in captures and stocks and of market demands, it should be left to the Member States concerned to determine the fishery products eligible for compensation, their respective maximum quantities and the compensation amounts within the overall allocation per Member State.\n(4) Member States should be authorised to differentiate the list and the quantities of fishery products concerned and the amount of compensation within the overall allocation per Member State. They should also be authorised to adjust their compensation plans if justified by changing conditions.\n(5) Member States should set the compensation amount at a level which allows appropriate off-setting of additional costs, arising from the specific handicaps of the outermost regions and in particular from the costs of transporting the products to continental Europe. To avoid overcompensation, the amount should be proportional to the additional costs the aid off-sets and in no case exceed 100\u00a0% of the transport and other related costs to continental Europe. To this end, it should also take into account other types of public intervention having an impact on the level of additional costs.\n(6) In order to achieve properly the objectives of this Regulation and to guarantee compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy, support should be limited to fishery products harvested and processed in accordance with the rules thereof.\n(7) In order that the compensation scheme operates effectively and correctly, Member States should also make sure that the recipients of aid are economically viable and that the implementing system allows for a regular application of the scheme.\n(8) To permit appropriate monitoring of the compensation scheme, the Member States concerned should submit annual reports on its operation.\n(9) To enable a decision to be taken on whether to continue the compensation scheme after 2013, the Commission should submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee based on an independent evaluation in due time before the end of the scheme.\n(10) The Community expenditure envisaged for the compensation scheme should be implemented under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund in direct centralised management according to Article 3(2)(f) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4).\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5).\n(12) For the implementation of direct centralised financial management, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2003/2006 of 21 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) of expenditure relating to the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products\u00a0(6) should apply,", "main_body": ["Subject-matter\nThis Regulation introduces a scheme for the period 2007 to 2013 to provide compensation for the additional costs incurred by the operators set out in Article 3 in the marketing of certain fishery products from the following outermost regions as a result of those regions\u2019 specific handicaps (hereinafter referred to as the compensation):\n\u2014 The Azores,\n\u2014 Madeira,\n\u2014 The Canary Islands,\n\u2014 French Guiana, and\n\u2014 R\u00e9union.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the definition of \u2018fishery products\u2019 set out in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products\u00a0(7) shall apply.", "Operators\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The compensation shall be paid to the following operators who incur additional costs in the marketing of fishery products:\n(a) the producers;\n(b) the owners or operators of vessels registered in the ports of the regions referred to in Article 1 and operating therein or associations of such operators; and\n(c) the operators in the processing and marketing sector or associations of such operators, who incur additional costs in marketing the products concerned.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States concerned shall take steps to ensure the economic viability of operators receiving the compensation.", "Eligible fishery products\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State concerned shall determine for its regions referred to in Article 1 the list of fishery products and the quantity of those products which are eligible for the compensation.
