Those errors need to be corrected. In addition it is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In particular where appropriate, the specific purity criteria have been adapted to reflect the limits for individual heavy metals of interest. For reasons of clarity the whole text concerning those substances should be replaced.\n(5) EFSA in its scientific opinion of 19 April 2006 concluded that the composition of maltitol syrup based on a new production method will be similar to that of the existing product and will be in accordance with the existing specification. It is therefore necessary to amend the definition of E 965 (ii) maltitol syrup set out in Directive 95/31/EC for E 965 by including that new production method.\n(6) Directive 95/31/EC should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 95/31/EC is amended and corrected in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 February 2008 at the latest.
