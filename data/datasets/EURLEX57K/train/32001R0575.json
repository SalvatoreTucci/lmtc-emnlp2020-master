Consequently, an exceptionally high number of animals will have to be kept and fed on holdings for a certain time.\n(4) All measures should be adopted to ensure that in doing this animal welfare conditions are respected.\n(5) The temporary use of land set aside under the arrangements for arable crops could ease this situation. The national authorities should therefore be permitted, in duly justified cases, to authorise the temporary use of set-aside land following the entry into force of restrictions on movement. Measures should, however, be adopted to ensure that use of the land concerned is not lucrative.\n(6) In view of the situation facing farmers, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999, Member States may, in duly justified cases, authorise producers in areas subject to restrictions on the movement of livestock because of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease to use set-aside land for sheltering and feeding livestock from 1 March to 30 April 2001.", "Member States shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that the set-aside land is not put to any lucrative use.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 March 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 13.\n(3) OJ L 280, 30.10.1999, p. 43.\n(4) OJ L 332, 28.12.2000, p. 63."}
