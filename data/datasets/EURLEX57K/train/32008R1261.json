The amendment to IFRS 2 provides clarification on what are vesting conditions, how to account for non-vesting conditions and how to account for cancellations of a share-based payment arrangement by the entity or the counterparty.\n(3) The consultation with the Technical Expert Group (TEG) of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) confirms that the amendment to IFRS 2 meets the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. In accordance with Commission Decision 2006/505/EC of 14 July 2006 setting up a Standards Advice Review Group to advise the Commission on the objectivity and neutrality of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group\u2019s (EFRAG\u2019s) opinions\u00a0(3), the Standards Advice Review Group considered EFRAG\u2019s opinion on endorsement and advised the European Commission that it is well balanced and objective.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Accounting Regulatory Committee,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 2 Share-based payment is amended in accordance with the Amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 2 Share-based payment, hereinafter \u2018amendment to IFRS 2\u2019, as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Each company shall apply the amendment to IFRS 2, as set out in the Annex to this Regulation, at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting after 31 December 2008.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nCharlie McCREEVY\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 320, 29.11.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 199, 21.7.2006, p. 33.\nANNEX\nINTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIFRS 2 \u2018Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payment\u2019\nReproduction allowed within the European Economic Area.

The amendments finalise the proposals that were contained in the exposure draft of proposed amendments to IFRS 2 \u2014 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations published in February 2006.\nEntities shall apply these amendments to all share-based payments within the scope of IFRS 2 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Earlier application is permitted.\nNON-VESTING CONDITIONS\nIn the Standard, after paragraph 21, a heading and paragraph 21A are added as follows.\n\u2018Treatment of non-vesting conditions\n21A Similarly, an entity shall take into account all non-vesting conditions when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods or services received from a counterparty that satisfies all vesting conditions that are not market conditions (e.g. services received from an employee who remains in service for the specified period of service), irrespective of whether those non-vesting conditions are satisfied.\u2019\nCANCELLATIONS\nIn the Standard, paragraph 28 is amended as follows.\n\u201828 If a grant of equity instruments is cancelled or settled during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied) \u2026\u2019\nIn the Standard, paragraph 28(b) is amended as follows.\n(b) \u2026 Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense. However, if the share-based payment arrangement included liability components, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at the date of cancellation or settlement. Any payment made to settle the liability component shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the liability.\u2019\nIn the Standard, after paragraph 28, paragraph 28A is added as follows.\n\u201828A If an entity or counterparty can choose whether to meet a non-vesting condition, the entity shall treat the entity\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s failure to meet that non-vesting condition during the vesting period as a cancellation.\u2019\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nIn the Standard, paragraph 62 is added as follows.\n\u201862 An entity shall apply the following amendments retrospectively in annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009:\n(a) the requirements in paragraph 21A in respect of the treatment of non-vesting conditions;\n(b) the revised definitions of \u201cvest\u201d and \u201cvesting conditions\u201d in Appendix A;\n(c) the amendments in paragraphs 28 and 28A in respect of cancellations.\nDEFINITIONS\nIn Appendix A, the definitions of \u2018vest\u2019 and \u2018vesting conditions\u2019 are amended as follows.\n\u2018vest To become an entitlement. Under a share-based payment arrangement, a counterparty\u2019s right to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity vests when the counterparty\u2019s entitlement is no longer conditional on the satisfaction of any vesting conditions.\nvesting conditions The conditions that determine whether the entity receives the services that entitle the counterparty to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity, under a share-based payment arrangement. Vesting conditions are either service conditions or performance conditions. Service conditions require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service. Performance conditions require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service and specified performance targets to be met (such as a specified increase in the entity\u2019s profit over a specified period of time). A performance condition might include a market condition.\u2019"}
