That Decision also lays down lists of third countries and parts thereof from which such imports are to be authorised and the model public and animal health certificates and the rules on the origin and treatments required for those products.\n(2) Part 3 of Annex II to that Decision lays down a list of third countries and parts thereof from which imports into the Community of biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products are authorised.\n(3) Under Decision 2007/777/EC, imports of biltong obtained from meat of domestic bovine, ovine and caprine animals and farmed cloven-hoofed game (excluding swine) that has undergone a specific treatment are authorised into the Community from a region of South Africa that is free of foot-and-mouth disease.\n(4) South Africa has requested the Commission to authorise imports into the Community of biltong obtained from wild cloven-hoofed game from the same region of South Africa already authorised for the domestic species.\n(5) Several Community inspections carried out in South Africa have demonstrated that the competent veterinary authority of that third country provides appropriate guarantees as regards compliance with Community legislation, in accordance with the first subparagraph of point 1 of Article 8 of Directive 2002/99/EC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to authorise imports into the Community of biltong obtained from wild cloven-hoofed game (excluding swine) from the South African region already authorised to export such products obtained from domestic animals, provided that the biltong has undergone the specific treatment \u2018E\u2019 set out in Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC.\n(7) In addition, Uruguay is currently listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC. Accordingly, imports of products obtained from meat of domestic bovine animals that has undergone a specific treatment are authorised into the Community from that third country.\n(8) Uruguay has requested the Commission to also authorise imports into the Community of biltong from that third country obtained from meat of domestic bovine animals that has undergone the appropriate specific treatment.\n(9) Taking into account the animal health situation in Uruguay, it is appropriate to authorise imports from that third country into the Community of biltong obtained from meat of domestic bovine animals that has undergone the specific treatment \u2018E\u2019 set out in Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC.\n(10) Decision 2007/777/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
