As a result, the Community contribution to the costs of restructuring and conversion may be higher in the convergence regions.\n(6) Account must be taken of the compensation for the loss of income incurred by the wine growers during the period when the vineyard is not yet in production.\n(7) In accordance with Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, where expenditure actually incurred by a Member State in a given financial year is less than 75\u00a0% of the initial allocation, the expenditure to be recognised for the following financial year, and the corresponding total area, are to be reduced by a third of the difference between this threshold and the actual expenditure incurred during the financial year in question.
