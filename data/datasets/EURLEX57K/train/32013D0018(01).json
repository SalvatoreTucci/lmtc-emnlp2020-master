This adjustment requires the Governing Council to determine the terms and conditions for transfers of capital shares between the NCBs that are members of the ESCB on 30 June 2013 in order to ensure that the distribution of these shares corresponds to the adjustments made. Accordingly, the adoption of a new decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2008/25 of 12 December 2008 laying down the terms and conditions for transfers of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital shares between the national central banks and for the adjustment of the paid-up capital\u00a0(2) with effect from 1 July 2013.\n(2) Hrvatska narodna banka will not join the ESCB until 1 July 2013, which means that the transfer of capital pursuant to Article 28.5 of the Statute of the ESCB does not apply to it on this occasion.\n(3) Decision ECB/2013/19 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(3) determines how and to what extent the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter \u2018euro area NCBs\u2019) are under an obligation to pay up the ECB\u2019s capital in view of the expanded capital key. Decision ECB/2013/20 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\u00a0(4) determines the percentage that the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is not the euro (hereinafter \u2018non-euro area NCBs\u2019) are under an obligation to pay up with effect from 1 July 2013 in view of the expanded capital key.\n(4) The euro area NCBs have already paid up their shares in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2010/27 of 13 December 2010 on the paying-up of the increase of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(5). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/19 states that euro area NCBs should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/19. Decision ECB/2010/27 supplements Decision ECB/2008/24 of 12 December 2008 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central bank\u2019s capital by the participating national central banks\u00a0(6).\n(5) Likewise, the non-euro area NCBs, with the exception of Hrvatska narodna banka, have already paid up a percentage of their shares in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2010/28 of 13 December 2010 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\u00a0(7). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/20 states that each of them should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the third column of the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/20. Article 2(2) of Decision ECB/2013/20 states that Hrvatska narodna banka should transfer to the ECB the amount shown next to its name in the third column of the table in Article 1 of the same Decision,", "main_body": ["Transfer of capital shares\nGiven the share in the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB, with the exception of Hrvatska narodna banka, will have subscribed on 30 June 2013, and the share in the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB will subscribe with effect from 1 July 2013 as a consequence of the adjustment of the capital key weightings laid down in Article 2 of Decision ECB/2013/17, the NCBs shall transfer capital shares among themselves via transfers to and from the ECB to ensure that the distribution of capital shares with effect from 1 July 2013 corresponds to the adjusted weightings. To this effect, each NCB shall, by virtue of this Article and without the need for any further formality or act, be deemed to have either transferred or received with effect from 1 July 2013 the share in the ECB\u2019s subscribed capital shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex I to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to a capital share that the ECB shall transfer to the NCB and \u2018-\u2019 to a capital share that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB.", "Adjustment of the paid-up capital\nGiven the amount of the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB has paid up and the amount of the ECB\u2019s capital that each NCB shall pay up with effect from 1 July 2013 pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/19 for the euro area NCBs and Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/20 for the non-euro area NCBs respectively, on 1 July 2013 each NCB shall either transfer or receive the net amount shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex II to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to an amount that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB and \u2018-\u2019 to an amount that the ECB shall transfer to that NCB.", "General provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The transfers described in Article 2 shall take place through TARGET2.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an NCB does not have access to TARGET2, the amounts described in Article 2 shall be transferred by crediting an account that the ECB or NCB shall nominate in due time.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of non-payment on 1 July 2013, interest due from 1 July 2013 until the day of payment shall be calculated on a daily basis, using the actual over-360-day method of calculation, at a rate equal to the latest available marginal interest rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations. The transferors and recipients of this interest shall be the same as the transferors and recipients of the amounts on which the interest accrues. Payment of the amounts described in Article 2 and the interest payments shall be made in two separate transactions.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ECB and the NCBs that are under an obligation to make a
