whereas such an offer price cannot always be fixed for certain products which are manufactured from various cuts and by various methods and are consequently offered on the market in a wide range of qualities ; whereas sluice-gate prices should accordingly not at present be fixed for those products;\nWhereas under Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 the sluice-gate price for pig carcases is to be made up of three components:    - an amount equal to the value on the world market of the quantity of feed grain equivalent to the quantity of feedingstuffs required for the production in third countries of one kilogramme of pigmeat,\n- a standard amount representing the extra cost, in relation to feed grain, of feedingstuffs other than grain required for the production of one kilogramme of pigmeat,\n- a standard amount representing overhead costs of production and marketing;\nWhereas this quantity of feed grain should be calculated on the basis of a processing coefficient of 1 : 5.46 ; whereas this coefficient is obtained by multiplying the total quantity of feedingstuffs required for the production and fattening of a young pig, (such quantity containing on average approximately 15 % of feedingstuffs other than grain), by a coefficient of 1.3 expressing the ratio of the value of one kilogramme of live swine to that of one kilogramme of pig carcases;\nWhereas it is appropriate to take as representative of the relevant quantity of feed grain on the world market a mixture of cereals with the following composition: >PIC FILE= \"T0008429\">\nWhereas, for the purpose of calculating the value of this quantity of feed grain and in view of its composition, it is thus clear that its price on the world market is equal to the average, weighted according to the composition of the above quantity, of the prices for each of the cereals in question;\nWhereas in order to calculate the price of each of the constituent cereals the average cif price for such cereals for the period mentioned in the second subparagraph of Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 should be used, this average being increased by 0.475 unit of account per 100 kilogrammes of cereals in order to take account of the costs of transport to the place of use and of the cost of processing into feed;\nWhereas the value for the quantity of feed grain does not take into account the extra value of protein feeds, mineral salts and vitamins ; whereas in the light of experience on the world market in recent years this extra value can be estimated in general at 15 % of the value of the quantity of feed grain ; whereas the value of that quantity should accordingly be increased by that percentage;  (1)See page 1 of this Official Journal.\nWhereas, on the basis of the information available, veterinary, stalling and labour costs on the world market may be estimated at approximately 15.63 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases, and the insurance, transport and trading margin costs on the world market at approximately 4.37 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases ; whereas the value of the quantity of feed grain should therefore be increased by 20 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases;\nWhereas when the sluice-gate prices applicable from 1 November, 1 February and 1 May are being fixed changes in world market prices for feed grain are to be taken into account only if the value of the quantity of feed grain varies by at least a specified minimum in relation to that used in calculating the sluice-gate price for the preceding quarter;\nWhereas a variation of less than 3 % does not have a noticeable effect on the costs of pig feed ; whereas the minimum variation should therefore be fixed at 3 %,", "main_body": ["In addition to meat of domestic swine in carcases or half-carcases, fresh, chilled, frozen, salted or in brine, with or without heads, feet or flare fat (subheadings 02.01 A III a) 1 and 02.06 B I a) 1 of the Common Customs Tariff), sluice-gate prices shall be fixed for the following products: >PIC FILE= \"T0007944\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0007945\">", "1.
