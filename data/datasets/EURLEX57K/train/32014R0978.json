The unutilised quantity amounts to 4\u00a0158 tonnes.\n(4) However, Spain had requested, pursuant to Article 4(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96\u00a0(3), that, within the limits of that Regulation, part of their mackerel fishing quota for 2013 be withheld and transferred to the following year.\n(5) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2014\u00a0(4) transferred 2\u00a0022 tonnes of Spain's 2013 unutilised\u00a0mackerel fishing quota to the year 2014. Hence, the remaining unutilised tonnage for the year 2013 amounts\u00a0to\u00a02\u00a0136.\n(6) The amount of 2\u00a0136 tonnes should be used to reschedule the deductions foreseen in Regulation (EU) No\u00a0165/2011 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 976/2012\u00a0(5). This quantity should be added to the 2013 deduction amount, which totalizes 10\u00a0262, and simultaneously subtracted from the deduction amount of subsequent years.\n(7) On 8 May 2014, Spain requested that the unutilised tonnage be subtracted from the 2014 deduction amount. This is compatible with the rationale expressed in recital 7 of Regulation (EU) No 165/2011. Regulation (EU) No\u00a0165/2011 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 976/2012\u00a0should, therefore, be amended accordingly,\n(8) Since the modification of Spain's catch limits as a result of this Regulation has an influence on the economic activities and the planning of the fishing season of Spanish vessels, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 of 22 February 2011 providing for deductions from certain mackerel quotas allocated to Spain in 2011 and subsequent years on account of overfishing in 2010 (OJ L\u00a048, 23.2.2011, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (OJ L\u00a0115, 9.5.1996, p.\u00a03).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2014 of 16 May 2014 adding to the 2014 fishing quotas certain quantities withheld in the year 2013 pursuant to Article 4(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (OJ L\u00a0147, 17.5.2014, p. 44).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 976/2012 of 23 October 2012 amending Regulation (EU) No 165/2011 providing for deductions from certain mackerel quotas allocated to Spain in 2011 and subsequent years on account of overfishing in 2010 (OJ L 294, 24.10.2012, p. 3).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nStock Initial quota 2010 Adapted quota 2010 Established catches 2010 Difference quota-catches (overfishing) Multiplying factor of Article 105(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (overfishing * 2) Deduction 2011 Deduction 2012 Deduction 2013 Deduction 2014 Deduction 2015 and, where appropriate, for subsequent years\nMAC/8C3411 27\u00a0919 24\u00a0604 44\u00a0225 \u2013 19\u00a0621 \u2013 39\u00a0242 7\u00a0744 5\u00a0500 10\u00a0262 5\u00a0989 9\u00a0747\u2019"}
