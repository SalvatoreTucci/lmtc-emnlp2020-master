Further details on the assessment procedure for metalaxyl will have to be defined in a specific act. In order to execute the judgment as soon as possible, the time period should be extended without waiting for the adoption of such an act.\n(8) Regulations (EC) No 2076/2002 and (EC) No 2024/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measure provided for in this Regulation is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 the following sentence is inserted after the first sentence:\n\u2018However, for metalaxyl the time period of 12 years referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC shall be extended until 30 June 2010\u2019.", "Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2024/2006 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 2 May 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
