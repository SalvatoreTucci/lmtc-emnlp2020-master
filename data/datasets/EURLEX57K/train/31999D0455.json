This Decision concerns only those kits for which the minimum requirements defined below are met. Partial kits falling below these minimum requirements are outside the scope of the Decision. The minimum requirements comprise all of the following: the structural elements of the building, the essential components of the external envelope including all necessary thermal insulation, and the internal linings in so far as they are necessary for the satisfaction of the essential requirements applied to the building.\nAlthough some components may be prepared in different factories, only the final kit for delivery, and not the various components, are concerned by this Decision.\n- for use in building works\nANNEX II\nATTESTATION OF CONFORMITY\nPRODUCT FAMILY\nTIMBER FRAME AND LOG PREFABRICATED BUILDING KITS\nSystems of attestation of conformity\nFor the product(s) and intended use(s) listed below, EOTA is requested to specify the following system(s) of attestation of conformity in the relevant guideline for European technical approvals:\n>TABLE>\nSystem 1: See Directive 89/106/EEC, Annex III(2)(i), without audit testing of samples.\nThe specification for the system should be such that it can be implemented even where performance does not need to be determined for a certain characteristic, because at least one Member State has no legal requirement at all for such a characteristic (see Article 2.1 of Directive 89/106/EEC and, where applicable, point 1.2.3 of the Interpretative Documents). In those cases the verification of such a characteristic must not be imposed on the manufacturer if he does not wish to declare the performance of the product in that respect."}
