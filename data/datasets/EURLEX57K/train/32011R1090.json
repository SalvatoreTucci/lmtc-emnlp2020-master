October is the last subperiod for the quotas with order numbers 09.4148 and 09.4168 laid down in Article 1(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98, which comprise the balance of the unused quantities from the previous subperiod.\n(3) The notifications presented under Article 8(a) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 show that, for the quota with order number 09.4138 the applications lodged in the first 10 working days of October 2011 under Article 4(1) of that Regulation cover a quantity greater than that available.
