Consequently, the relevant criterion of the existing purity criteria set out in Directive 96/77/EC needs to be adapted.\n(4) It is necessary to adapt to technical progress the existing purity criteria for E 251 sodium nitrate and E 459 beta-cyclodextrin.\n(5) It is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for additives as set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).\n(6) Directive 96/77/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 96/77/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 November 2004 at the latest.
