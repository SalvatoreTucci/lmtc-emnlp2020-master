For the 2008/09 marketing year those quotas should be adjusted.\n(2) The adjustments result from the allocation of additional and supplementary isoglucose quotas.\n(3) The possible supplementary isoglucose quotas which might be allocated at a later date for the 2008/09 marketing year upon requests by undertakings approved in Italy, Lithuania, and Sweden will be taken into account in the next adjustment of the quotas laid down in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 before the end of February 2009.\n(4) The adjustments also result from the application of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20\u00a0February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(2), which provides for restructuring aid for undertakings which renounce their quotas and from the application of Article 4a(4) of that Regulation which provides for a definitive reduction of quotas allocated to undertakings in case of growers' applications for restructuring aid. It is therefore necessary to take account of the quotas renounced or reduced as a result of grower's applications for the 2008/09 marketing year under the restructuring scheme.\n(5) Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.
