whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13 (4), the intervention of an approved certification body is required for that purpose;\nWhereas Article 13 (4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;\nWhereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13 (3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;\nWhereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13 (3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex II shall be indicated in mandates for harmonized standards.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 June 1997.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 220, 30. 8. 1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nWaste water engineering products inside buildings\nBack-flow devices: air admittance valve ventilating pipework.\nKits for waste water pumping station and effluent lifting plants.\nWaste water engineering products outside buildings\nKits and elements for waste water treatment plants and on-site treatment equipment.\nSeptic tanks.\nPrefabricated drainage channel.\nManholes and inspection chambers.\nCovers, step irons, ladders and handrail for manholes and inspection chambers, gully tops.\nSeparators.\nANNEX II\nPRODUCT FAMILY\nWASTE WATER ENGINEERING PRODUCTS INSIDE BUILDINGS (1/2)\nSystems of attestation of conformity\nFor the product(s) and intended use(s) listed below, CEN/Cenelec is requested to specify the following system(s) of attestation of conformity in the relevant harmonized standard(s):\nProduct Intended use Level or class Attestation of conformity system\nBack-flow devices: air admittance valve ventilating pipework For use inside buildings  4\u00a0(1)\nThe specification for the system should be such that it can be implemented even where performance does not need to be determined for a certain characteristic, because at least one Member State has no legal requirement at all for such characteristic (see Article 2.1 of Directive 89/106/EEC and, where applicable, clause 1.2.3 of the Interpretative Documents).
