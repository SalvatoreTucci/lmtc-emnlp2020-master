France had requested the authorisation in the context of an administrative reform involving the decentralisation of certain specific powers previously exercised by central government. Decision 2005/767/EC expired on 31 December 2009.\n(2) By letter dated 12 August 2009, France requested authorisation to continue to apply differentiated rates of taxation under the same conditions for a further 6 years after 31 December 2009.\n(3) Decision 2005/767/EC was adopted on the basis that the measure requested by France met the requirements set out in Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC. In particular, it was considered that that measure would not hinder the proper functioning of the internal market. It was also considered that it was in conformity with the relevant Community policies.\n(4) The national measure is part of a policy designed to increase administrative effectiveness by improving the quality and reducing the cost of public services, as well as a policy of subsidiarity. It offers regions an additional incentive to improve the quality of their administration in a transparent fashion. In this respect, Decision 2005/767/EC requires that the reductions be linked to the socioeconomic circumstances of the regions in which they are applied. Overall, the national measure is based on specific policy considerations.\n(5) The tight limits set for the differentiation of rates on a regional basis as well as the exclusion of gas oil used for commercial purposes from the measure imply that the risk of competitive distortions in the internal market is very low. Moreover, the application of the measure so far has shown a strong tendency on behalf of regions to levy the maximum rate allowable, which has further decreased any potential for competitive distortions.\n(6) No obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market have been reported as regards, more particularly, the circulation of the products in question in their capacity as products subject to excise duty.\n(7) When originally requested, the national measure had been preceded by a tax increase equal to the margin for regional reductions. Against this background and in light of the conditions of the authorisation as well as experience gathered, the national measure does not, at this stage, appear to be in conflict with Union energy and climate policies.\n(8) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that Article must be strictly limited in time. Due to the possible future developments of the Union framework on energy taxation, this authorisation should be limited to a period of 3 years. It is furthermore appropriate to avoid any time gap with respect to the application of the authorisation,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0France is hereby authorised to apply reduced rates of taxation to unleaded petrol and gas oil used as fuel.
