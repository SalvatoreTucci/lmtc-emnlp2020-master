That Decision allows the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures to ensure harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of the spectrum band.\n(4) Since the 169,4 to\u00a0169,8 MHz band is appropriate for applications benefiting people with impairments or disabilities, and\u00a0considering that promotion of such applications is a policy objective for the Community together with the general objective of ensuring the functioning of the internal market, the Commission pursuant to Article\u00a04(2) of the Radio Spectrum Decision issued the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administration (hereinafter the CEPT) with a mandate to examine, inter alia, applications related to assistance for people with disabilities.\n(5) As mandated, the CEPT produced a new frequency plan, and a channel arrangement allowing six types of preferred applications to share the band in order to meet several Community policy needs.\n(6) For these reasons and\u00a0in accordance with the objectives of the Radio Spectrum Decision, Directive 90/544/EEC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["Directive 90/544/EEC is hereby repealed with effect from 27\u00a0December 2005.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 14\u00a0December 2005.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
