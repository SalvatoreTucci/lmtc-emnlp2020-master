In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles.\n(3) Common rules should be laid down for exports from the Union.\n(4) Exports are almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore possible to accept as a Union principle that exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction, subject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty.\n(5) The Commission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary.\n(6) It is essential that examination should take place at Union level, in particular on the basis of any such information, of export terms and conditions, of export trends, of the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation, and of the measures, if any, to be taken.\n(7) It may become apparent from this examination that the Union should exercise surveillance over certain exports, or that interim protective measures should be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices.\n(8) Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations.\n(9) It is necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international commitments setting up, in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties, a system for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply with the resulting obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, without prejudice to Union provisions adopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of appropriate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the Union or all the Member States.\n(10) This Regulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. Its operation should be complementary to that of the instruments establishing the common organisation of agricultural markets, and to that of the special instruments adopted under Article 352 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of those instruments, particularly the protective clauses thereof, must however be avoided.\n(11) The implementation of this Regulation requires uniform conditions for the adoption of protective measures. Those measures should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nBASIC PRINCIPLE", "The exportation of products from the Union to third countries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nUNION INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURE", "If, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures within the meaning of Chapter III might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards, established by Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6).
