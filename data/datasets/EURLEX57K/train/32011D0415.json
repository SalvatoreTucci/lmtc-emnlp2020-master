Directive 2010/19/EU introduced harmonised requirements with regard to spray-suppression for all vehicle categories covered by Council Directive 91/226/EEC\u00a0(3). Accordingly, Annexes IV and XI to Directive 2007/46/EC were also amended in that Directive for the purposes of adaptation to technical progress. As those Annexes have already been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1060/2008 of 7 October 2008 replacing Annexes I, III, IV, VI, VII, XI and XV to Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)\u00a0(4) and amended by several regulations, their subsequent amendments should also have been done by means of a regulation. It is therefore appropriate, in the interest of legal clarity, to correct Directive 2010/19/EU.\n(2) Article 2 of Directive 2010/19/EU should therefore be deleted.\n(3) The measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2013 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Directive 2010/19/EU is deleted.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 72, 20.3.2010, p. 17.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 103, 23.4.1991, p. 5.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 292, 31.10.2008, p. 1."}
