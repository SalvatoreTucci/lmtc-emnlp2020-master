The provisional MRLs for that substance set out for bovine and porcine species expire on 1 January 2015.\n(4) Additional data was provided and assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use who recommended that the provisional MRLs for tulathromycin in bovine and porcine species should be set as definitive.\n(5) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use concluded that the extrapolation to other food producing species cannot be supported for this substance.\n(6) The entry for tulathromycin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance \u2018tulathromycin\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Tulathromycin (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S, 13S,14R)-2-ethyl-3,4,10,13-tetra-hydroxy-3,5,8,10,12,14-hexamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethy-lamino)-\u00df-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopent-decan-15-one expressed as tulathromycin equivalents Ovine, caprine 450 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption Anti-infectious agents/Antibiotics\u2019\n250 \u03bcg/kg Fat\n5\u00a0400 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n1\u00a0800 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\nBovine 300 \u03bcg/kg Muscle\n200 \u03bcg/kg Fat\n4\u00a0500 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n3\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\nPorcine 800 \u03bcg/kg Muscle\n300 \u03bcg/kg Skin and fat in natural proportions\n4\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n8\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Kidney"}
