whereas  these rules provide for an official field inspection to be carried out during the period of seed  production;\nWhereas the abovementioned rules provide in principle that basic seed, certified seed and certified  seed of the first generation may be officially certified and their packages officially closed in  accordance with the OECD schemes and for the varietal certification of seed moving in international  trade; whereas, furthermore, such rules provide for seed sampling and testing in accordance with  the methods of the International Seed Testing Association ('ISTA`);\nWhereas in the respective third countries an examination of these rules and the manner in which  they are applied has shown that the prescribed field inspection of seed producing crops satisfies  the relevant conditions laid down in the abovementioned Directives; whereas the conditions  governing seed harvested and controlled in these countries afford the same assurances as regards  the seed's characteristics, the arrangements for its examination, for ensuring identity, for  marking and for control, as do the conditions applicable to seed, harvested and controlled within  the Community;\nWhereas Decision 85/355/EEC  (5), which established equivalence for field inspections in the  abovementioned countries and Decision 85/356/EEC  (6) which established equivalences for seed  produced in the abovementioned countries, expired on 30 June 1995; whereas a new decision is  therefore necessary;\nWhereas the OECD schemes for the varietal certification of seed moving in international trade, upon  which this Decision is based, may be modified in the near future; whereas, in these circumstances,  it appears desirable to limit the continuation of the equivalence under this Decision to 18  months;\nWhereas this Decision is without prejudice to a possible renewal of the equivalence in respect of  Cyprus where seed production and field inspections did not take place under Decisions 85/355/EEC  and 85/356/EEC;\nWhereas this Decision does not preclude Community findings being revoked where the conditions on  which they are based cease to be satisfied; whereas, to this end, further practical information on  seed produced in the abovementioned countries should be obtained by growing and checking samples of  such seed in Community comparative tests;\nWhereas certain provisions in this decision are subject to technical amendment; whereas, to  simplify the procedures, such modifications should be dealt with under the procedure of the  Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["It is hereby declared that field inspections of seed producing crops  of the categories 'certified seed` and 'certified seed for the first generation`, carried out in  the countries and by the Authorities listed in Part I of the Annex hereto, and in respect of the  group of species or species specified therein, satisfy the conditions laid down in Part A of Annex  I to Directive 66/400/EEC and in Annex I to Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC in so  far as the conditions laid down in Part II (A) of the Annex hereto are satisfied.", "It is hereby also declared that where the conditions laid down in Part II (B) of the  Annex hereto are satisfied, seed of the categories 'basic seed`, 'certified seed` and 'certified  seed of the first generation` harvested in the countries listed in Part I of the Annex and  officially controlled by the respective Authorities also listed in Part I of the Annex and  belonging to the group of species or species specified therein, is equivalent to seed of the  corresponding categories harvested within the Community and complying with Directives 66/400/EEC,  66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC.", "1.
