Tamame of Leopoldo Alas Clarin 16, Zamora, Spain (hereinafter referred to as 'Tamame'), who would be interested in running this service jointly with Udo Bach; and the Spanish authorities therefore  consider that, if the proposed service is authorized for the German operator, it should also be authorized for the Spanish operator;\nWhereas the German authorities consider that the aforementioned Article 8 (3) should only apply when another operator has submitted an application at the same time as the one which is under consideration by the Member States concerned;\nWhereas Udo Bach and Tamame have been unable to reach agreement on the joint operation of the proposed coach service between Norderstedt and Alicante;\nWhereas it can be considered that there is a demand for the coach service proposed by Udo Bach in that there is no direct motor-rail link from the Hamburg area in Germany to Alicante in Spain, which is a major tourist route;\nWhereas the introduction of new coach services which take private cars off the roads should be encouraged, since this is a safer mode of transport and is also environmentally friendly;\nWhereas the French authorities, as a transit Member State, informed the Commission by a letter of 3 September 1991 that they had no objections to the service provided that it did not pick up or set down passengers in France and was only for passengers  whose cars were carried separately on vehicle transporters and that such carriage complied with the rules applicable to professional road haulage;\nWhereas the minutes of the proceedings of the Mixed German-Spanish Committee which have been submitted by the Spanish authorities concern only a given service between Germany and a third country and do not contain a general agreement concerning the  authorization of regular services and special regular services to be operated between the two countries; whereas it is, therefore, not necessary to decide whether such an agreement between two Member States would be consistent with Regulation (EEC) No  517/72;\nWhereas whilst the Commission appreciates that the interests of existing coach operators in participating in the running of a proposed service should be considered in accordance with Article 8 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 517/72, the negotiations between  Udo Bach and Tamame to operte this service jointly have not resulted in agreement;\nWhereas the decision whether to run a coach service jointly is one which should be left to the commercial judgment of the operators concerned;\nWhereas if Tamame wishes to run a similar service he may also apply for authorization to the appropriate authorities; whereas the Spanish authorities agree that they have not asked the German authorities to give their consent to an application made by  Tamame,", "main_body": ["Udo Bach of Reesendamm, 8, W - 2381 Busdorf, Germany, shall be granted, by the competent authority, an authorization, valid for a two-year period, to operate a coach service between Norderstedt, Germany, and Alicante, Spain, exclusively for  passengers whose cars are transported separately. Udo Bach may pick up and set down passengers en route at Hittfeld, Garbsen, Essen, Frechen, Ruesselsheim and Valencia. This authorization does not cover the picking-up of passengers in Valencia destinated  for Alicante and in Alicante destinated for Valencia.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany and to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 July 1992.
