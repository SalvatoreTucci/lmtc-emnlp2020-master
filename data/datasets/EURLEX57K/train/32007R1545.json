For the 2007/2008 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met.\n(3) To ensure that refineries within the Community have a sufficient supply of raw sugar to fulfil their traditional supply needs, the complementary quantity should be allocated between the third countries concerned in a way to ensure full delivery. For India, it is considered appropriate to maintain an initial quantity of 10\u00a0000 tonnes. As regards the remaining supply need, a global quantity should be fixed for the ACP States, which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["For the period from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008, the complementary quantity of raw cane sugar for refining falling within CN code 1701\u00a011\u00a010, as referred to in Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, shall be:\n(a) 70\u00a0000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the States listed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 except India;\n(b) 10\u00a0000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in India.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
