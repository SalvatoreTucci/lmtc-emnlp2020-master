That report also stated that a high priority should be given to short-term public finance statistics for Member States, in particular those participating in economic and monetary union, and that the objective was the compilation of simplified quarterly non-financial accounts for the general government sector resulting from a step-by-step approach.\n(3) It is appropriate to define simplified quarterly non-financial accounts for general government by reference to the list of ESA 95 categories of government expenditure and revenue defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1500/2000 of 10 July 2000 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to general government expenditure and revenue(5).\n(4) Priority in the step-by-step approach was given to taxes, actual social contributions and social benefits other than social transfers in kind, as categories representing reliable indicators of trends in public finances that are already available on time (first step).\n(5) The transmission of this first set of categories on a quarterly basis, from June 2000, in all Member States is covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to short-term public finance statistics(6).\n(6) It is necessary to supplement the first step with another set of categories in order to obtain the full list of categories constituting general government expenditure and revenue.\n(7) The reliability of quarterly data provided under this Regulation with regard to annual data should be assessed. A report on the quality of the quarterly data should therefore be made before the end of 2005.\n(8) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 lay down the conditions under which the Commission may adopt amendments to the ESA 95 methodology in order to clarify and improve its content. The compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts for general government will require additional resources in Member States. Their transmission to the Commission cannot therefore be dealt with in a Commission Decision.\n(9) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7), and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB), set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC(8), have each been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of those Decisions,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to define the content of quarterly non-financial accounts for general government, to lay down the list of the ESA 95 categories to be transmitted by Member States from 30 June 2002 and to specify the main characteristics of these categories.", "Content of the quarterly non-financial accounts for general government\nThe content of the quarterly non-financial accounts for general government is defined in the Annex by reference to a list of ESA 95 categories constituting general government expenditure and revenue.", "Categories concerned by the transmission of quarterly data\n1.
