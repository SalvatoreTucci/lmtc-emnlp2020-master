requirements, established by those Decisions.\n(7) In the light of the review of those criteria and requirements, it is appropriate to prolong the period of validity of the ecological criteria and the requirements for a period of one year.\n(8) Since the review obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 only concerns the ecological criteria and assessment and verification requirements, it is appropriate that Decisions 2002/255/EC and 2002/747/EC remain in effect.\n(9) Decisions 2000/45/EC, 2001/405/EC, 2001/688/EC, 2002/255/EC and 2002/747/EC should therefore be amended
