For the purposes of calculating that threshold, turnover in non-ferrous metals may be disregarded,\n\u2014 an exemption for the supply and intracommunity acquisition of non-ferrous metals.\n(5) Taxable entities carrying out transactions which are exempt pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of Decision 98/161/EC may be authorised not to make supplies and intra-Community acquisitions of used and waste materials effected by them subject to the special measures provided for by that Decision.\n(6) The derogating measure was needed because of the difficulty in dealing with fraud in this sector, where certain operators, mainly small dealers, did not comply with their obligations under Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC to pay to the authorities the tax they had charged for their supplies. Enforcing collection of the tax in this sector is especially difficult because of the complications of identifying and supervising the activities of non-compliant traders. Hence these arrangements constitute an effective fraud-prevention measure.\n(7) On 7 June 2000, the Commission published a strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system in the short term, in which it undertook to rationalise the large number of derogations currently in force. In some cases, however, this rationalisation could involve extending certain particularly effective derogations to all Member States. The Commission's communication of 20 October 2003 reiterates this compromise.\n(8) The Kingdom of the Netherlands should be granted an extension for the current derogation until the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector, but not later than 31 December 2005.\n(9) The derogation has no adverse impact on the Communities' own resources accruing from VAT, nor does it have an effect on the amount of VAT charged at the final stage.\n(10) In order to ensure legal continuity, this Decision should apply as from 1 January 2004,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Decision 98/161/EC, the date \u201831 December 2003\u2019 shall be replaced by the following wording: \u2018until the date of entry into force of a special scheme for the application of VAT to the recycled waste sector amending Directive 77/388/EEC, but not later than 31 December 2005\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply as from 1 January 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 14 June 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
