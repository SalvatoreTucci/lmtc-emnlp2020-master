To assist, in their efforts to adjust family agricultural holdings which have been weakened in the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy by the new conditions obtaining on the markets and which are not able through their own efforts to carry out successfully the process of adaptation owing to their economic and structural situation, a Community system is hereby instituted whereby the Member States may be authorized to grant transitional aids to agricultural income, hereinafter referred to as 'income aids'.\nArticles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty shall not apply to the aids granted in conformity with this Regulation.\n2. Income aids may contribute in particular to:\n(a) safeguarding income at fair levels during a process of adaptation which may affect the structure, organization or management of agricultural holdings;\n(b) alleviating the impact, in terms of income, arising from the financial obligations of agricultural holdings;\n(c) supporting the level of agricultural income during efforts to diversify the farmer's activity outside agriculture.\nThey must not stimulate agricultural production nor bring about distortion of competition.\n3. The Community shall contribute towards the financing of the income aids on the terms laid down in Title II.\nTITLE I\nThe system of income aids", "Income aids may only be authorized within the scope of this system where:\n(a) they form part of a programme drawn up by the Member State concerned in accordance with Article 3;\n(b) the recipients meet the conditions laid down in Article 4 (1);\n(c) they do not exceed in amount the level determined in accordance with Article 5; and\n(d) they are granted in compliance with the special detailed rules set out in Article 6.", "1.

Where the geographical scope of the PAIA is not the national territory, it shall be delimited in terms of the administrative regions of the Member State concerned. However, the PAIA may relate only partially to one or more administrative regions where the socio-structural characteristics of agricultural holdings are broadly homogeneous in the planned area of application.", "1. The farmers and members of their families working on the holding may qualify for income aid only where the overall family income amounts, per work unit, to less than a threshold determined by the Member State concerned, having regard to the national provisions in force for similar measures and the objectives and detailed rules on granting the aid laid down in the PAIA in question.\nThat threshold may in no case exceed 70 % of the national gross domestic product or 90 % of the regional gross domestic product per member of the working population.\n'Overall family income' means the income of the farmer and of those members of his family working on the holding, including any non-agricultural resources.\n2. The agricultural income of the holding to be taken into account shall be established:\n- on the basis of an indicator consistent with the concept of gross domestic product referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph,\n- by means of accounting data or other objective criteria relating to the holding, to be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13.", "1. The level of income aid shall be determined on the basis of the injury arising for potential recipients from the adjustment of the markets in the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the adjustment of the common organizations of the markets; it shall be established, as the Member State concerned so chooses, on a flat-rate or individual basis.\n2. Where the level of the aid is established on a flat-rate basis for the PAIA application area and/or sector:\n(a) the injury referred to in paragraph 1 shall, in compliance with the detailed rules to be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 13, be established overall on the basis of a multi-annual reference period for the holdings in the application area and/or sector in question, expressed as a total amount;\n(b) the aid granted to individual recipients in the application area and/or sector may not exceed overall the amount referred to in (a); the amount of aid may be differentiated on the basis of objective data relating to the holding (utilized agricultural area, standard gross margin, etc.).\n3. Where the level of the aid is established individually, it may at most cover the injury referred to in paragraph 1, suffered by the holding concerned. That injury shall be established on the basis of a multi-annual reference period and in compliance with detailed rules to be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13. Article 6\n1. The detailed rules for granting the income aids shall be governed by the following special conditions:\n(a) the aids may not be granted on the basis of the prices and/or quantity of production of the holding concerned;\n(b) the aids may be granted to an individual recipient only degressively and for no more than a maximum of five years from the first payment;\n(c) the Member States shall exclude from income aids households where farming accounts for a negligible part of the income.\n2. In order to prevent distortion of competition, maximum amounts of aid per work unit, expressed as a percentage of the average regional or national income shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13.\nIn no case may aid exceed ECU 2 500 per year per work unit on the holding concerned.\n3. In order to achieve the objectives in Article 1 (2) (a) and (b),\n(a) the amount of the aid to be granted to individual recipients may be capitalized;\n(b) for the application of the threshold referred to in Article 4 (1) and for the purpose of applying Article 5, the net agricultural income of the holding may be used, determined by means of accounting figures.\nThe detailed rules for the application of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13.", "1. Where a Member State plans to introduce or amend a PAIA, it shall notify the Commission of the draft programme or the proposed amendment. The notification must contain the information required for assessing whether the conditions laid down in this Regulation are met.\nAt the request of the Commission, the Member State concerned shall provide additional information for assessment purposes.\n2. Member States may not implement the planned measure before the Commission has approved the PAIA concerned.\nWhen making its assessment the Commission shall ensure that the planned measures are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, having regard in particular to the objectives referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2).\n3. Within three months from the date of receipt of a draft PAIA or amendments thereto, the Commission, having consulted the Committee provided for in Article 13, shall decide whether to approve the draft PAIA or the amendments thereto provided that all the particulars set out in Article 3 and, where appropriate, the additional information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, are provided.\n4. The first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be without prejudice to the Member State concerned implementing, in the framework of a PAIA approved in accordance with paragraph 3, income aid measures which are more restrictive than those laid down in the PAIA in question as regards in particular:\n- the geographical or sectoral scope,\n- the detailed rules for the grant in accordance with Articles 4 and 5,\nand\n- the duration of application\nof income aids actually granted.\n5.
