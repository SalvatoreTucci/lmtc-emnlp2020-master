Regulation (EC) No 975/1999\u00a0(2)\u00a0has proved to be an adequate legal instrument for the implementation of the Community's technical and financial support for human rights and democratisation activities in developing and other third countries in pursuit of the overall objectives in this field. The period of validity of that Regulation, however, expires on 31 December 2004.
