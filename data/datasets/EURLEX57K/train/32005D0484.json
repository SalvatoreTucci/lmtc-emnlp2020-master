This means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13(4) of Directive 89/106/EEC, the intervention of an approved certification body is required.\n(2) Article 13(4) of Directive 89/106/EEC requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications. It is therefore desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications.\n(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC are described in detail in Annex III to that Directive. It is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures shall be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.\n(4) The procedure referred to in Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 89/106/EEC corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC. The procedure referred to in Article 13(3)(b) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex II shall be indicated in the mandates for Guidelines for European technical approvals.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.

In those cases the verification of such a characteristic must not be imposed on the manufacturer if he does not wish to declare the performance of the product in that respect."}
