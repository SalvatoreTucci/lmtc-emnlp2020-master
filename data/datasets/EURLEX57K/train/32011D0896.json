The \u2018traditional\u2019 rum to which the reduced rate of excise duty applies is now defined in point 1(f) of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks\u00a0(4). The reduction in excise duty is confined to an annual quota of 108\u00a0000 hectolitres of pure alcohol. The derogation expires on 31 December 2012.\n(2) In order to adapt the terms of Decision 2007/659/EC to Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and bearing in mind that \u2018traditional\u2019 rum is produced only in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union, therefore, a reference should be made in this amending Decision exclusively to those four outermost regions.\n(3) On 29 June 2010, the French authorities sent the Commission the report provided for in Article 4 of Decision 2007/659/EC. The report contains two requests. First, the French authorities ask that the annual quota be increased from 108\u00a0000 hectolitres to 125\u00a0000 hectolitres of pure alcohol to reflect trends on the market for rum in the Union. Secondly, they request an extension by 1 year, i.e. to 31 December 2013, of the period of application of Decision 2007/659/EC so as to bring it into line with that of a State aid decision on the same issue adopted by the Commission on 27 June 2007\u00a0(5) (hereinafter: \u2018the State aid Decision\u2019).\n(4) The information provided by the French authorities shows that quantities of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum coming onto the market at the reduced rate of excise duty have grown since the adoption of Decision 2007/659/EC, from 96\u00a0100 hectolitres of pure alcohol in 2007 to 105\u00a0700 hectolitres in 2010, i.e. an annual increase of 3,2\u00a0%. Provided that this trend continues, the quantities of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum coming onto the market should be around 109\u00a0100 hectolitres of pure alcohol in 2011, 112\u00a0600 hectolitres in 2012 and 116\u00a0200 hectolitres in 2013, thus exceeding the 108\u00a0000 hectolitre quota provided for by Decision 2007/659/EC.\n(5) Recital 9 of Decision 2007/659/EC underlines that since the competitiveness of \u2018traditional\u2019 rum from the overseas departments needs to be supported on the market in mainland France in order to safeguard the activity of their sugar-cane rum sector, the quantities of traditional rum originating in the overseas departments eligible for a reduced rate of excise duty when released for consumption on that market should be reviewed. The 108\u00a0000 hectolitre annual quota established by Decision 2007/659/EC should be, therefore, increased to 120\u00a0000 hectolitres, including the quota for 2011 in order to ensure continuity, taking into account the increase forecasted for that year. This increase would cover annual growth of 4,3\u00a0%, i.e. a little more than the 3,2\u00a0% increase witnessed in 2007-10.\n(6) It is also necessary to extend the period of application of Decision 2007/659/EC by 1 year so that it expires at the same time as that of the State aid Decision.\n(7) Decision 2007/659/EC should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/659/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) the title is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(4) Article 3(1) is replaced by the following:\n(5) in Article 5, the date 31 December 2012 is replaced by that of 31 December 2013.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
