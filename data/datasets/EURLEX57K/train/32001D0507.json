In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(10) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(8) provides the regulatory framework for the provisions of this Decision, particularly those relating to access to administrative data sources, statistical confidentiality and the principle of cost-effectiveness.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).\n(12) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(10),", "main_body": ["Field of application and general objectives\n1.
