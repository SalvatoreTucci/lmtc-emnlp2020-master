Article 10(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 10(1) to (4) thereof sets out specific provisions for the evaluation of products used in the Union as silage additives at the date that Regulation became applicable.\n(2) In accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 were entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as existing products belonging to the functional group of silage additives, for all animal species.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, applications were submitted for the authorisation of the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 as feed additives for all animal species, requesting those additives to be classified in the category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and in the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019. Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 23 May 2012\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U and NCIMB 30094 have the potential to improve the production of silage from all forages by increasing the preservation of dry matter and reducing the pH. The preparation of Lactobacillus plantarum VTT E-78076 has the potential to improve the production of silage from easy and moderately difficult to ensile material by reducing the pH and ammonia nitrogen. The preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 have the potential to improve the production of silage from easy ensile material by reducing the pH and dry matter loss. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparations specified in the Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Transitional measures\nThe preparations specified in the Annex and feed containing them, which are produced and labelled before 4 June 2013 in accordance with the rules applicable before 4 December 2012 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2732.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of fresh material\nCategory of technological additives.
