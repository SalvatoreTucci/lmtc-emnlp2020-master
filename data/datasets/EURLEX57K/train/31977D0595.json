In particular there are grounds for suspecting that there have been and still are agreements or concerted practices between steel-producing undertakings, between steel-distributing undertakings and between steel-producing and distributing undertakings, fixing production and supply quotas, supply channels and prices and sharing out markets.\nIn order to ascertain the facts, the Director-General for Competition has ordered checks to be made at a number of steel-producing or distributing undertakings pursuant to the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty.\nThe investigation at Stahlwerke R\u0e23\u0e16chling-Burbach GmbH, V\u0e23\u0e16lklingen, planned for 7 September 1976, was to have extended to books and papers which were withheld from officials of the Federal Cartel Office during an investigation carried out on 25 August 1976 at the same undertaking, of the grounds that the Federal Cartel Office had no authority in respect of the relevant products. However, Commission investigators discovered during their investigation that the files described by the Federal Cartel Office were no longer kept in the Richardstra\u0e23\u009fe 12 premises.\nThe company's management stated that the books and papers had been destroyed on its instructions.\nThe fact that no written explanation of this behaviour, as required by the Commission and promised by the undertaking, was ever provided, despite a written reminder on 21 September 1976, gives grounds for suspecting that the books and papers in which the Commission is interested are being kept elsewhere. It is accordingly necessary, to require the undertaking by Decision to submit them for inspection.\nThe undertaking must guarantee that the Commission officials carrying out the investigation will be permitted, during normal office hours, to enter its premises, to inspect the books and papers described in Article 1, to take copies and photocopies as they may require, and to call for immediate verbal and written explanations regarding the matter under investigation.\nArticle 47 of the ECSC Treaty, the full text of which is annexed hereto, empowers the Commission to impose fines of up to one per cent of annual turnover, or periodic penalty payments of up to five per cent of average daily turnover for each day's delay on undertakings which evade their obligations under decisions taken in pursuance of that Article, or which knowingly furnish false information,", "main_body": ["Stahlwerke R\u0e23\u0e16chling-Burbach GmbH, V\u0e23\u0e16lklingen, is hereby required to permit checks to be made in its business premises in V\u0e23\u0e16lklingen. It shall, in particular, allow Commission officials empowered to carry out the checks to enter its premises during normal office hours, produce for examination the books and papers demanded by those officials for the period beginning with the last quarter of 1970, particularly those which were in the upper storey of Richardstra\u0e23\u009fe 12 in V\u0e23\u0e16lklingen on 25 August 1976, including:    - the \"forging\" agreement,\n- the structural-steel agreement,\n- the Luxembourg agreement (crude-steel quotas and procedures for fixing them),\n- statistics of the rolled-steel joint-selling agencies, rationalization groups and the German-Luxembourg-Belgian-Dutch Business Association,\n- European market protection agreement,\n- books and papers relating to the agreement between German producers of rolled-steel products made within the Rolled Steel Association, concerning prices to be charged in Germany and other Community countries,\nallow the officials to take copies or photocopies, and give immediate oral and written explanations of matters related to the subject of the checks.
