This requires an amendment to the adjustment coefficient to be applied to the reference quantities for each traditional operator C. Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1121/2001 must therefore be amended.\n(4) It should be recalled that, for the second half of 2001, the reference quantity for each traditional operator is subject to Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["The adjustment coefficient in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1121/2001 to be applied to each traditional operator C is hereby replaced by the adjustment coefficient 0,98339.", "The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the operators concerned of the reference quantity as adjusted pursuant to Article 1 no later than 17 August 2001.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 4 August 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFrederik Bolkestein\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 47, 25.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 31, 2.2.2001, p. 2.\n(3) OJ L 126, 8.5.2001, p. 6.\n(4) OJ L 153, 8.6.2001, p. 12."}
