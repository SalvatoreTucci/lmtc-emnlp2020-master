Those rules apply also to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivision to it and which is established by specific Community provisions, with a view to the application of tariff and other measures relating to trade in goods.\n(3) Pursuant to those general rules, the goods described in column 1 of the table set out in the Annex should be classified under the CN codes indicated in column 2, by virtue of the reasons set out in column 3.\n(4) It is appropriate to provide that binding tariff information which has been issued by the customs authorities of Member States in respect of the classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature but which is not in accordance with this Regulation can, for a period of three months, continue to be invoked by the holder, under Article 12(6) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(5) The classification of \u2018audio-frequency apparatus\u2019 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 955/98 of 29 April 1998 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature\u00a0(3) has led to classifications of so-called \u2018home cinema systems\u2019 under CN code 8543\u00a089\u00a095. Since such classifications are not in accordance with the classification set out in the Annex to this Regulation, they have to be considered as incorrect.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 955/98 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["The goods described in column 1 of the table set out in the Annex shall be classified within the Combined Nomenclature under the CN codes indicated in column 2.", "Binding tariff information issued by the customs authorities of Member States, which is not in accordance with this Regulation, can continue to be invoked for a period of three months under Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.", "Point 2 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 955/98 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.
