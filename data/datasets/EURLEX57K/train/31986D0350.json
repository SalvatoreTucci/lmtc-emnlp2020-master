Duration\nThe programme will cover the four years from the beginning of 1986 until the end of 1989.\n3. Areas concerned\nThe whole of the Portuguese littoral.\n4. Development policy\nFuture activity will be concentrated on species with good market prospects and with well-established rearing technology. Among these species the most important in value are:\n(a) Clams\n(b) Sea bream\n(c) Eel\n5.

Investment requirement\nTo achieve these production targets an investment of about 617 000 ECU would be necessary during the period covered by the programme. National aid to be allocated to these investments may be estimated at 168 000 ECU.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission notes that the programme submitted by the Government of Portugal as a framework for future Community and national financing constitutes an initial measure to guide investments in aquaculture.\n2. In view of the situation on the Community market in trout reared exclusively in fresh water, the Commission cannot approve that part of the programme relating to the establishment of new installations for farming such species. Furthermore, it points out that with regard to projects for modernizing existing fish farms in this field, it will give priority to investments aimed at reducing pollution, and in particular pollution generated by waste water, and investments enabling the mortality rate in ponds to be reduced.\n3. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in the programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n4. The Commission considers that the programme targets and their attainment should be the subject of a more detailed analysis in the light of developments in the structural and economic situation of fish farming in Portugal. Moreover, it reserves the right to reassess its decision in the light of developments in the structural aspects of the common fisheries policy after 1986."}
