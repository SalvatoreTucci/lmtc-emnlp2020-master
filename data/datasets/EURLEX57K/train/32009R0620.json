Article 2 of that Regulation provides that the tariff quota is to be managed by the Commission in accordance with Article 144 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Detailed rules should therefore be adopted for the administration of that quota.\n(2) That quota should be managed using import licences. Therefore, rules should be laid down concerning the submission of applications and the information to be provided in the applications and licences. Where necessary, that can be done by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector\u00a0(4).\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(5) lays down detailed rules concerning the applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued for the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, it is appropriate to sub-divide each import tariff quota period into several sub-periods.\n(5) The release into free circulation of the products imported under the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 should be subject to a presentation of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authority of the exporting third country. The issue of such certificates of authenticity should guarantee that the imported products qualify as high-quality beef as defined in this Regulation. The form and layout of the certificates of authenticity and the procedures for using those certificates should be specified. Certificates should be issued by authorities in third countries affording all the necessary guarantees to ensure that the arrangements concerned are properly applied.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 provides that the import tariff quota is opened from 1 August 2009. Therefore, this Regulation should also apply from the same day.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down rules for the administration of import tariff quota of high-quality beef as provided for in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the tariff quota\u2019.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall apply to high-quality fresh, chilled or frozen beef that fulfils the requirements laid down in Annex I.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, \u2018frozen meat\u2019 means meat with an internal temperature of \u2013\u00a012\u00a0\u00b0C or lower when it enters the customs territory of the Community.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulations (EC) No 1301/2006, (EC) No 376/2008, and (EC) No 382/2008 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "Administration of the tariff quota\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quota shall be administered by applying the simultaneous examination method in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate of the import duty, referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, shall be mentioned in section 24 of the import licence application and the import licence as provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quota year provided for in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 shall be divided into 12 monthly sub-periods.

The heifers and steers that are fed the diet described in point 1 shall be fed, on average, no less than 1,4\u00a0% of live body weight per day on a dry matter basis.\n3. The carcass from which beef cuts are derived are evaluated by an evaluator employed by the national government who bases the evaluation, and a resulting classification of the carcass, on a method approved by the national government. The national government evaluation method, and its classifications, must evaluate expected carcass quality using a combination of carcass maturity and palatability traits of the beef cuts. Such an evaluation method of the carcass shall include, but not be limited to, an evaluation of the maturity characteristics of colour and texture of the longissimus dorsi muscle and bone and cartilage ossification, as well as an evaluation of expected palatability traits, including a combination of the discrete specifications of intramuscular fat and firmness of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n4.
