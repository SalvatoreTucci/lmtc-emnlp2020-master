Producers may benefit, on request, from aid granted by the competent Dutch authorities for sows on their holding which are subject to the ban on insemination introduced from 3 June 1997 by the Dutch regulation \"Regulation banning pig breeding 1997 - Regeling fokverbod varkens 1997\".\n2. The aid shall be ECU 32 per sow per month. It shall be granted for eligible sows kept on the applicant's holding throughout the duration of the ban on insemination and inseminated within four months of the lifting of the ban. Each sow shall remain uncovered for a period at least as long as the ban on insemination. The number of months for which the aid is granted shall be equal to the duration of the ban on insemination. The aid may be paid out six months after the entry into force of the ban on insemination at the earliest.\n3. The Dutch authorities shall adopt all necessary measures to apply the aid referred to in paragraph 1, in particular provisions relating to the definition of eligible animals and their identification.\nAs regards the lodging of applications, inspection measures and penalties, Article 5, Article 6 (1), (3) and (4) and the first subparagraph of Article 6 (5), Article 8, Article 10 (2) and (5) and Articles 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 (*) laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n4.

They shall inform the Commission regularly of the application of the aid scheme set up under this Article.\n5. Seventy per cent of the expenditure on this aid shall be covered by the Community budget, for a total maximum number of 220 000 sows.\nHowever, the Community financial contribution may not exceed the Community expenditure which would have been incurred in granting the aid referred to in Article 1 (4) for the delivery of very young piglets produced by an equal number of sows in a period equal to the duration of the ban on insemination, less 116 days.\nAdvance payments exceeding the definitively eligible amount in accordance with the preceding subparagraph calculated after the lifting of the ban on insemination shall be reimbursed to the EAGGF in the month following the decision fixing that eligible amount.\n(*) OJ No L 391, 31. 12. 1992, p. 36.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 August 1997.\nFor the Commission\nMonika WULF-MATHIES\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 349, 31. 12. 1994, p. 105.\n(3) OJ No L 62, 4. 3. 1997, p. 26.\n(4) OJ No L 202, 30. 7. 1997, p. 40.\n(5) OJ No L 391, 31. 12. 1992, p. 36.\n(6) OJ No L 197, 22. 8. 1995, p. 2."}
