It therefore meets the conditions set out in Article 27 of the sixth VAT Directive.\n(7) The forms of tax evasion or avoidance in question consist mainly of the initial purchase of VAT-exempt investment gold which is then worked to make jewellery or other goods, without VAT being charged on the value of investment gold included in the transaction concerned.\n(8) The derogation is granted until 31 December 2004, so that an assessment can be made as to whether it is appropriate in the light of changes in the practical application of the special system for investment gold established by Directive 98/80/EC(2).\n(9) The derogation has no negative impact on the European Communities' own resources derived from value added tax,", "main_body": ["The French Republic is authorised, by derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the sixth VAT Directive, to include in the taxable amount in respect of the supply of goods or services comprising the working of tax-exempt investment gold the value of the gold contained in the finished product based on the current market value of the investment gold.", "The authorisation granted under Article 1 shall expire on 31 December 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
