These sections or containers must be so designed as to allow them to be cleaned easily and to ensure that melt water cannot remain in contact with the fishery products.\n2. When used, the sections of vessels or the containers reserved for the storage of fishery products must be completely clean and, in particular, must not be capable of being contaminated by the fuel used for the propulsion of the vessel or by bilge water.\n3.

The fishery products shall be handled and stored in such a way as to prevent bruising. The use of spiked instruments shall be tolerated for the moving of large fish or fish which might injure the handler, provided the flesh of these products is not damaged.\n5. Fishery products other than those kept alive must undergo cold treatment as soon as possible after loading. However, in the case of fishing vessels where cooling is not possible from a practicable point of view, the fishery products must not be kept on board for more than eight hours.\n6. Ice used for the chilling of products must be made from drinking water or clean seawater. Before use, it must be stored under conditions which prevent its contamination.\n7. After the fishery products have been unloaded, the containers, equipment and sections of vessels which are directly in contact with the fishery products must be cleaned with drinking water or clean seawater.\n8. Where fish is headed and/or gutted on board, such operations must be carried out hygienically and the products must be washed immediately and thoroughly with drinking water or clean seawater. The viscera and parts which may pose a threat to public health must be removed and set apart from products intended for human consumption. Livers and roes intended for human consumption must be refrigerated or frozen.\n9. Equipment used for gutting, heading and the removal of fins, and containers and equipment in contact with the fishery products, must be made of or coated with a material which is waterproof, resistant to decay, smooth and easy to clean and disinfect.

Fishing vessels must be equippped with holds, tanks or containers for the storage of refrigerated or frozen fishery products at the temperature laid down by Directive 91/493/EEC. These holds shall be separated from the machinery space and the quarters reserved for the crew by partitions which are sufficiently impervious to prevent any contamination of the stored fishery products.\n2. The inside surface of the holds, tanks or containers shall be waterproof and easy to wash and disinfect. It shall consist of a smooth material or, failing that, smooth paint maintained in good condition, not being capable of transmitting to the fishery products substances harmful to human health.\n3. The holds shall be designed to ensure that melt water cannot remain in contact with the fishery products.\n4. Containers used for the storage of products must ensure their preservation under satisfactory conditions of hygiene and, in particular, allow drainage of melt water.

Vessels equipped for chilling of fishery products in cooled seawater, either chilled by ice (CSW) or refrigerated by mechanical means (RSW), shall comply with the following requirements:\n(a) tanks must be equipped with adequate seawater filling and drainage installations and must incorporate devices for achieving uniform temperature throughout the tanks;\n(b) tanks must have a means of recording temperature connected to a temperature sensor positioned in the section of the tank where temperatures are highest;\n(c) the operation of the tank or container system must secure a chilling rate which ensures the mix of fish and seawater reaches 3\u00b0 C at the most six hours after loading and 0\u00b0 C at the most after sixteen hours;\n(d) after each unloading, the tanks, circulation systems and containers must be completely emptied and thoroughly cleaned using drinking water or clean seawater. They should only be filled with clean seawater;\n(e) the date and the number of the tank must be clearly indicated on the temperature recordings which must be kept available for the control authorities.\n9. The competent authority shall keep up to date for control purposes a list of the vessels equipped in accordance with points 7 or 8, with the exception however of vessels equipped with removable containers which, without prejudice to point 5, second sentence of Annex I, are not engaged regularly in preserving fish in chilled seawater.\n10.
