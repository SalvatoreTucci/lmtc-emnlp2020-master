The provisional MRL for that substance set out for bovine and porcine species expires on 1 January 2015.\n(4) An application for the extension of the existing entry to ovine species applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.\n(5) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the extension of the MRL to ovine species and the extrapolation of the MRLs from ovine species to caprine species.\n(6) The entry for tulathromycin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the MRL for ovine and caprine species.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance \u2018tulathromycin\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Tulathromycin (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-2-ethyl-3,4,10,13-tetra-hydroxy-3,5,8,10,12,14-hexamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethy-lamino)-\u00df-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopent-decan-15-one expressed as tulathromycin equivalents Ovine, caprine 450 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption Anti-infectious agents/Antibiotics\u2019\n250 \u03bcg/kg Fat\n5\u00a0400 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n1\u00a0800 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\nBovine 300 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption\n200 \u03bcg/kg Fat\n4\u00a0500 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n3\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Kidney\nPorcine 800 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Provisional MRLs expire on 1 January 2015\n300 \u03bcg/kg Skin and fat in natural proportions\n4\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Liver\n8\u00a0000 \u03bcg/kg Kidney"}
