On 2 April 2004 the EFSA delivered its opinion that from the point of view of consumer health, MON 863 maize and derived products are as safe as grain and derived products from conventional maize lines\u00a0(2). In delivering its opinion the EFSA addressed all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States.\n(5) Article 46(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed\u00a0(3) provides that requests submitted under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 before the date of application of this Regulation shall be processed under the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, notwithstanding Article 38 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, in cases where the additional assessment report required in accordance with Article 6(3) or 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 has been transmitted to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(6) The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), in collaboration with the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL), has validated a method for detection of MON 863 maize. The JRC has carried out a full validation study (ring-trial) following internationally accepted guidelines to test the performance of a quantitative event-specific method to detect and quantify the MON 863 transformation event in maize. The materials needed in the study had been provided by Monsanto. The JRC has considered that the method performance was appropriate for its purpose, taken into account the performance criteria proposed by the ENGL for methods submitted for regulatory compliance as well as the current scientific understanding about satisfactory method performance. Both the method and the results of the validation have been made publicly available.\n(7) Reference material for MON 863 maize has been produced by the JRC.\n(8) Food and food ingredients from MON 863 maize should be labelled in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and should be subject to the traceability requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(4).\n(9) In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004\u00a0(5), a unique identifier has been assigned to the product for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003.\n(10) Information, contained in the Annex, on the identification of foods and food ingredients derived from MON 863 maize, including the validated detection method and the reference material, should be retrievable from the Register referred to in Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n(11) On the basis of the information available, it is established that MON 863 maize complies with criteria laid down in Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(12) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not given an opinion; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 26 July 2005 in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC\u00a0(6), the Council being required to act within three months.\n(13) However, the Council has not acted within the required time limit; a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Foods and food ingredients derived from genetically modified maize line MON 863 (hereinafter referred to as the products), as designated and specified in the Annex, may be placed on the Community market as novel foods or novel food ingredients.", "The products shall be labelled as \u2018genetically modified maize\u2019 or \u2018produced from genetically modified maize\u2019 in accordance with the labelling requirements laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.", "The products and the information included in the Annex shall be entered in the Community Register of genetically modified food and feed.", "This Decision is addressed to Monsanto Europe SA, Belgium, representing Monsanto Company, USA.
