customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters to include cooperation on container security and related matters\n(2004/634/EC)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, in conjunction with Article 300(2), first sentence thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1) The Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters\u00a0(1) (CMAA) provides for the possibility of its expansion with a view to increasing the levels of customs cooperation and supplementing them by means of agreements on specific sectors or matters.\n(2) The Commission has negotiated on behalf of the Community an agreement with the United States of America intensifying and broadening the CMAA to include cooperation on container security and related matters (the Agreement).\n(3) The Agreement expands the customs cooperation between the Community and the United States of America to cover container security and related matters.\u00a0It envisages the prompt and successful expansion of the Container Security Initiative to all ports in the Community that meet relevant requirements.\u00a0The Agreement also sets out a work programme for further implementation measures, including the development of standards for risk management techniques, information required to identify high-risk shipments imported into the Parties, and industry partnership programmes.\n(4) The external coordination of customs control standards with the United States of America is necessary to ensure supply chain security while guaranteeing the continued flow of legitimate trade in containers.\u00a0In particular, it is essential to ensure that all Community ports can participate in the Container Security Initiative on the basis of uniform principles and that comparable standards are promoted in United States (US) ports.\u00a0Thus, the direct aim and content of the Agreement concerns the facilitation of legitimate trade between the Community and the United States of America while ensuring on a reciprocal basis a high level of security by allowing for cooperation in developing actions in specific control areas in respect of which the Community has competence.\n(5) Member States should have the possibility to expand the Container Security Initiative to all Community ports through arrangements with the United States of America identifying Community ports that participate in the Container Security Initiative and providing for the stationing of US customs officials therein or to maintain any such existing declarations of principles to that end, provided these arrangements are in conformity with the Treaty and compatible with the CMAA as expanded by the Agreement.\n(6) It is necessary to ensure close cooperation between the Member States and the Community institutions for the purpose of further intensification and broadening of the customs cooperation under the CMAA as expanded.\n(7) To that end a consultation procedure should be established whereby Member States envisaging to negotiate arrangements with the United States of America on matters covered by the CMAA as expanded would immediately notify such intention and provide the relevant information.\u00a0If so requested by a Member State or the Commission within short time limits the information should be the subject of consultations between the Member States and the Commission.\n(8) The main purpose of the consultations should be to facilitate the exchange of information and to ensure that the arrangements are consistent with the Treaty and with common policies, in particular the common framework of cooperation with the United States of America set out in the CMAA as expanded.\n(9) Where the Commission considers that an arrangement that a Member State wishes to implement with the United States of America is incompatible with the CMAA as expanded or that the subject matter should be addressed in the framework of the CMAA as expanded, it should inform the Member State accordingly.\n(10) The consultation procedure should be without prejudice to the respective competencies of the Member States and the Community to conclude the arrangements envisaged.\n(11) The Agreement should be approved,", "main_body": ["The Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on intensifying and broadening the Agreement on

cooperation can be further improved by, among other things, intensifying the exchange of relevant information and best practices among the US Customs and Border Protection, the European Commission and the customs authorities of Member States of the European Community in order to ensure that general customs controls of international trade take due account of security concerns.\n(7) Acknowledging the importance of extending this cooperation to all modes of international transport and all kinds of goods, initially putting priority on sea-container transport.\n(8) Recognising the high volume of two-way sea-container and other modes of trade between the European Community and the United States of America, and the important role of both the European Community and the United States of America as transport hubs for containers coming from many countries.\n(9) Recognising that global sea containers are imported into, transhipped through, or transiting the United States of America and the European Community.\n(10) Being convinced that there is a need to deter, prevent, and interdict any\u00a0terrorist attempts to disrupt global trade by concealing\u00a0terrorist weapons in global sea-container trade or other shipments, or by using such shipments as weapons.\n(11) Being convinced of the need to increase security for the European Community and the United States of America and at the same time facilitate legitimate trade.\n(12) Noting the importance of developing, to the extent practicable, reciprocal systems for securing and facilitating legitimate trade with due regard to threat assessments.\n(13) Recognising that substantially greater security of legitimate trade can be achieved through a system where the customs authority of the importing country works collaboratively with customs authorities involved in earlier parts of the supply chain to use timely information and inspection technology to target and screen high-risk containers before they are shipped from their ports or places of loading or transhipment.\n(14) Supporting the objectives of the Container Security Initiative (CSI), which is designed to safeguard global maritime trade by enhancing cooperation at seaports world wide in order to identify and examine high-risk containers and ensure their in-transit integrity.\n(15) Recalling Article 5 of the CMAA that determines the relationship between that Agreement and any bilateral agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters that have been or may be concluded between individual Member States of the European Community and the United States of America.\n(16) Recognising that expansion of CSI should occur as quickly as possible for all ports within the European Community where the exchange of
