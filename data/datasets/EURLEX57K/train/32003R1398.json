Directive 92/65/EEC lays down certain rules concerning animals and species susceptible to the notifiable diseases listed in Annex A to that Directive.\n(2) The small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) is an exotic pest affecting honey bees and bumble bees that has spread from Africa to a number of other third countries, creating serious problems to the apiculture industry.\n(3) The small hive beetle is not listed by the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE) and information about the extent of its infestation in third countries is not available.\n(4) No cases have been reported in the Community however the small hive beetle is not a notifiable disease within the European Community under Directive 92/65/EEC.\n(5) If introduced into the Community, the small hive beetle could have devastating consequences on the health status of honey bees, on the apiculture industry and on the production of honey.\n(6) Tropilaelaps (Tropilaelaps spp.) is an exotic parasitic mite affecting honey bees that is mainly found in south-east Asia but which if imported into the Community could have devastating consequences on the health status of honey bees, on the apiculture industry and on the production of honey.\n(7) Tropilaelaps is an OIE notifiable disease. However it is not a notifiable disease within the European Community under Directive 92/65/EEC.\n(8) Ebola virus and monkey pox virus are recorded from time to time in certain third countries and Community measures restricting imports have been taken against Ebola and monkey pox as these zoonotic diseases can affect or be carried by certain animals; it is therefore opportune for transparency and clarity to include these diseases as notifiable under Directive 92/65/EEC.\n(9) Therefore it is necessary to add the small hive beetle, Tropilaelaps spp., Ebola virus, and monkey pox virus to the list of notifiable diseases in Annex A to Directive 92/65/EEC.\n(10) Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex A to Directive 92/65/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 August 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 268, 14.9.1992, p. 54.\n(2) OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX\nAnnex A to Directive 92/65/EEC is replaced by the following:\n\"ANNEX A\nNotifiable diseases in the context of this Directive\n>TABLE>\""}
