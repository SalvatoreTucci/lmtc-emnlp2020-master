When the product includes sludge from sewage treatment plants, the sludge must be in conformity with Annex IB of Directive 86/278/EEC.\nFitness for use\nGeneral Labelling\nThe product packaging must bear the following labelling information:\n- the name and address of the body responsible for marketing,\n- a descriptor identifying the product by type, including the phrase 'soil improver',\n- recommended conditions of storage and the recommended 'use by' date, together with a manufacturing batch code,\n- a description of the purpose for which the product is intended and any limitations to use. The suitability of the product for particular plant groups (e. g. calcifuges or calcicoles) should be stated,\n- the major feedstocks (those over 10 % by volume) from which the product has been manufactured, distinguishing between municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, wastes from agriculture or forestry, industrial and commercial wastes specifying the sector  (e.g. food processing, paper, etc.),\n- a statement on recommended methods of use and rate of application expressed as kilogrammes or litres of product per m\u00b2 of ground per annum,\n- guidelines for safe handling and use.\nProduct performance\nAll products must be supplied in a solid form and contain not less than 25 % dry matter by weight.\nThe minimum rate of application must be stated so as to provide not less than 500g organic matter (dry weight) per m\u00b2 of ground (as measured by loss on ignition).\nProducts must not adversely affect plant emergence or subsequent growth in the defined plant growth test.\nSoil degradation and water pollution\nNo product may contain amounts of the following elements in concentrations greater than the values shown below, measured in terms of dry weight:\n\"\" ID=\"1\">Zn> ID=\"2\">300\"> ID=\"1\">Cu> ID=\"2\">75\"> ID=\"1\">Ni> ID=\"2\">50\"> ID=\"1\">Cd> ID=\"2\">1,5\"> ID=\"1\">Pb> ID=\"2\">140\"> ID=\"1\">Hg> ID=\"2\">1\"> ID=\"1\">Cr> ID=\"2\">140\"> ID=\"1\">Mo (1)()> ID=\"2\">2\"> ID=\"1\">Se (2)()> ID=\"2\">1,5\"> ID=\"1\">As  (3)()> ID=\"2\">7\"> ID=\"1\">F (4)()> ID=\"2\">200\"\">\nProducts must not contain constituents which have been treated with lindane, cypermethrin or promecarb.\nNutrient loadings\nWhen used at the recommended rates of application, products must not exceed maximum nutrient loadings of:\n- 8 g/m\u00b2 total nitrogen,\n- 6 g/m\u00b2 P2O5,\n- 12 g/m\u00b2 K2O.\nNote: Products will be exempt from this requirement if less than 10 % (w/w) of the nutrient content is available for plant growth during the first season of application. Such products (for example, many mulches) are defined as those having a C : N ratio  greater than 30 : 1.\nHealth and Safety\nProducts must not exceed the maximum levels of primary pathogens set out in the Table below:\n\"\" ID=\"1\">Salmonella> ID=\"2\">Absent in 25 g\"> ID=\"1\">E. coli> ID=\"2\">< 1 000 MPN (5)()/g\"\">\nNuisance\nNo product shall give rise to persistent offensive odours after being applied to the soil.\nNo product shall contain any fragments of glass, wire, other metal or hard plastic which may constitute a hazard to human health.\nNo product shall introduce unacceptable numbers of weed seeds or the vegetative reproductive parts of aggressive weeds into the soil.\nTest Methods and Analysis\nTest methods and analysis for heavy metals are to be in accordance with the requirements of Directive 86/278/EEC. In the absence of internationally agreed test methods for physical and microbiological analysis in relation to soil improvers the test  method is the responsibility of Member States.\n(1)() Data relating to the presence of these elements are needed only for products containing material from an industrial process, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge.(2)() MPN: Mean Probable Number."}
