In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) Directive 93/94/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles as replaced by Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles\u00a0(5) and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of two or three-wheel vehicles as regards the space for mounting the rear registration plate. Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to allow for the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(3) The objective of this Directive is not to harmonise the dimensions of registration plates used in the various Member States. The Member States should therefore ensure that protruding registration plates do not constitute a danger for users, without, however, this requiring any modification with regard to vehicle construction.\n(4) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,", "main_body": ["This Directive shall apply to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of all types of motor vehicles as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "The procedure for the granting of EC component type-approval in respect of the space for mounting the rear registration plate for a type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle and the conditions governing the free movement of such vehicles shall be as laid down in Chapters II and III of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "The amendments necessary to adapt to technical progress the requirements of Annex I shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2) of Directive 2002/24/EC.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall not, on grounds relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate:\n\u2014 refuse, in respect of a type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle, to grant EC type-approval,\n\u2014 prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of two or three-wheel motor vehicles,\nif the space for mounting the rear registration plate complies with the requirements of this Directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate if the requirements of this Directive are not fulfilled.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.", "Directive 93/94/EEC, as amended by the Directive listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in Annex III.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2010.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 July 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
