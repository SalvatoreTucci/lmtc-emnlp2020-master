Any extension of that waiver would be of minimal economic and trade importance to the Union.\n(5) The current waiver relating to Canada\u2019s trade preference programme CARIBCAN will expire on 31 December 2011. Any extension of that waiver would be of minimal economic and trade importance to the Union and would also be in line with the Union\u2019s policy to support the economic development of developing countries through trade preferences.\n(6) The current waiver allowing Cuba to derogate from paragraph 6 of Article XV GATT 1994 will expire on 31 December 2011. Any extension of that waiver would be of minimal economic and trade importance to the Union.\n(7) The current waiver allowing countries participating in the Kimberley Process certification scheme to impose certain restrictions on the trade of so-called \u2018blood diamonds\u2019 will expire on 31 December 2011. Any extension of that waiver would be of minimal economic and trade importance to the Union while being of great relevance for its overall trade relations.\n(8) It is appropriate, therefore, to establish the position to be taken by the Union within the WTO General Council concerning those waivers,", "main_body": ["The position to be taken by the European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization is to support the following requests relating to the WTO waivers pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the WTO Agreement:\n(a) requests for granting and/or extending the waivers relating to the introduction of the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) and its amendments from 1992 (\u2018HS92 changes\u2019), 1996 (\u2018HS96 changes\u2019), 2002 (\u2018HS2002 changes\u2019), 2007 (\u2018HS2007 changes\u2019) and 2012 (\u2018HS2012 changes\u2019), as well as future HS amendments, which establish the obligation to introduce these changes to Members\u2019 schedules of concessions;\n(b) requests for extending the waiver allowing Cape Verde to extend the period for the full implementation of Article VII GATT 1994 and of the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation;\n(c) requests for extending the waiver allowing Canada to grant preferential treatment to selected developing countries (CARIBCAN programme);\n(d) requests for extending the waiver allowing Cuba to derogate from paragraph 6 of Article XV GATT 1994;\n(e) requests for extending the waiver relating to the Kimberley Process certification scheme.", "The Commission shall inform the Council via the Trade Policy Committee sufficiently in advance of any meeting of the relevant WTO body at which a decision may be taken on a request covered by this Decision.
