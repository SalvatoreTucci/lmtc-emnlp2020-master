PROCEDURE\n(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 92/2002(2), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of urea originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania and the Ukraine, and exempted a Bulgarian exporting producer from the said duties as an undertaking had been accepted by the Commission from the company concerned.\n(2) Joint Stock Company Achema, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of urea originating, inter alia, in Lithuania offered an acceptable undertaking prior to the publication of the definitive findings but at a stage when it was administratively impossible to include its acceptance in the definitive Regulation.\n(3) The Commission, by Decision No 2002/498/EC(3), accepted the undertaking offer by Joint Stock Company Achema. The reasons for accepting this undertaking are set out in this Decision. The Council recognises that the revisions introduced to the undertaking offer eliminate the injurious effect of dumping and seriously limit any risk of circumvention in the form of cross-compensation with other products.\n(4) In view of the acceptance of the undertaking offer it is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 92/2002 accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 92/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
