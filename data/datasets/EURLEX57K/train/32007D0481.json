These events have a special general resonance in Finland, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events.\n(7) The men\u2019s Ice Hockey World Championships, organised by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), have a special general resonance, as ice hockey is played actively by the Finnish people, and a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the Finnish population in view of the great success of the Finnish team in this international tournament. Because of their specific organisation, the Ice Hockey World Championships should be treated as a single event in which matches between other countries also affect the position of teams against which Finland must or may play and the overall result.\n(8) The Nordic World Ski Championships (cross-country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined), organised by the International Ski Federation (FIS), have a special general resonance and a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the Finnish population as a catalyst of cultural identity, as Nordic skiing enjoys the status of a national sport in Finland.\n(9) The listed athletics events, namely the World Championships in Athletics, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and the European Athletics Championships, organised by the European Athletics Association (EAA), have a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the Finnish population as a catalyst of cultural identity, as the top Finnish athletes representing Finland internationally in a wide range of individual disciplines are among the world elite in their specialities.\n(10) The listed events have traditionally been broadcast on free television and have commanded large television audiences.\n(11) The Finnish measures appear proportionate so as to justify a derogation from the fundamental EC Treaty freedom to provide services on the basis of an overriding reason of public interest, which is to ensure wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society.\n(12) The Finnish measures are compatible with EC competition rules in that the definition of qualified broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events relies on objective criteria that allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of listed events is not disproportionate so as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay-television markets.\n(13) The proportionality of the Finnish measures is reinforced by the fact that they have no retroactive effect and thus have no impact on the exercise of the broadcasting rights to listed events acquired before the date of their entry into force.\n(14) The Commission communicated the measures notified by Finland to the other Member States and presented the results of this verification at the meeting of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC of 15 November 2006. The Committee adopted a favourable opinion at this meeting.\n(15) The Finnish measures were adopted on 22 February 2007 and entered into force on 1 March 2007,", "main_body": ["The measures pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC notified by Finland to the Commission on 22 September 2006 are compatible with Community law.", "The measures, as finally taken by Finland and set out in the Annex to this Decision, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nViviane REDING\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, p. 23.
