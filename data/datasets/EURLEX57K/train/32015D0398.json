Article 9 of that Directive lays down criteria for the approval of compulsory national control programmes for certain contagious diseases, including Aujeszky's disease. In addition, Article 10 of that Directive provides that where a Member State considers its territory or part thereof to be free of such diseases, including Aujeszky's disease, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission.\n(2) Commission Decision 2008/185/EC\u00a0(2) lays down the additional guarantees for movements of pigs between Member States. Those guarantees are linked to the classification of Member States according to their Aujeszky's disease status.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC lists Member States or regions thereof which are free of Aujeszky's disease and where vaccination is prohibited. Annex II to that Decision lists Member States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky's disease are in place.\n(4) Hungary is currently listed in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC, as a Member State or region thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky's disease have been implemented.\n(5) Hungary has submitted documentation in support of its application to declare Hungary free from Aujeszky's disease.\n(6) Following the evaluation of the supporting documentation submitted by Hungary, it is appropriate that Hungary is no longer listed in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC, but instead be listed in Annex I thereto.\n(7) Decision 2008/185/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2008/185/EC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p.\u00a01977/64.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2008/185/EC of 21 February 2008 on additional guarantees in intra-Community trade of pigs relating to Aujeszky's disease and criteria to provide information on this disease (OJ L\u00a059, 4.3.2008, p.\u00a019).\nANNEX\nANNEX I\nMember States or regions thereof free of Aujeszky's disease and where vaccination is prohibited\nISO code Member State Regions\nBE Belgium All regions\nCZ Czech Republic All regions\nDK Denmark All regions\nDE Germany All regions\nIE Ireland All regions\nFR France The departments of Ain, Aisne, Allier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, Ard\u00e8che, Ardennes, Ari\u00e8ge, Aube, Aude, Aveyron, Bas-Rhin, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Calvados, Cantal, Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cher, Corr\u00e8ze, C\u00f4te-d'Or, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, Creuse, Deux-S\u00e8vres, Dordogne, Doubs, Dr\u00f4me, Essonne, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Finist\u00e8re, Gard, Gers, Gironde, Hautes-Alpes, Hauts-de-Seine, Haute Garonne, Haute-Loire, Haute-Marne, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Haut-Rhin, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, Haute-Savoie, Haute-Vienne, H\u00e9rault, Indre, Ille-et-Vilaine, Indre-et-Loire, Is\u00e8re, Jura, Landes, Loire, Loire-Atlantique, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Loz\u00e8re, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Marne, Mayenne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Morbihan, Moselle, Ni\u00e8vre, Nord, Oise, Orne, Paris, Pas-de-Calais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, R\u00e9union, Rh\u00f4ne, Sarthe, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Savoie, Seine-et-Marne, Seine-Maritime, Seine-Saint-Denis, Somme, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne, Territoire de Belfort, Val-de-Marne, Val-d'Oise, Var, Vaucluse, Vend\u00e9e, Vienne, Vosges, Yonne, Yvelines\nIT Italy The province of Bolzano\nCY Cyprus All regions\nLU Luxembourg All regions\nHU Hungary All regions\nNL Netherlands All regions\nAT Austria All regions\nSI Slovenia All regions\nSK Slovakia All regions\nFI Finland All regions\nSE Sweden All regions\nUK United Kingdom All regions\nANNEX II\nMember States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky's disease are in place\nISO code Member State Regions\nES Spain All regions\nPL Poland All regions"}
