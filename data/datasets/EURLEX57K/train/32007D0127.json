As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nBy letters of 19 February 2003, 19 February 2004, 18 February 2005 and 15 February 2006, the European Union informed you of its decisions not to revoke the application of the \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 and to extend the period of application until 20 February 2004, 20 February 2005, 20 February 2006 and 20 February 2007 respectively.\nTwelve months later, the European Union considers that no significant progress has been made in the five areas referred to in the Council Decision of 18 February 2002.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union does not consider that the appropriate measures can be revoked and it has decided to extend their period of application until 20 February 2008.\nThe European Union would once again emphasise that it is not penalising the Zimbabwean people and it will continue its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support of the population, in particular projects in social sectors, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are not affected by these measures.\nThe European Union wishes to recall that the application of appropriate measures within the meaning of Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is no obstacle to political dialogue as defined in the provisions of Article 8 of that same Agreement.\nWith this in mind, the European Union wishes to underline once again the importance that it attaches to future EC-Zimbabwe cooperation. The European Union wishes to confirm its willingness to continue to make use of the opportunity provided by the ongoing 10th EDF programming exercise to carry on the dialogue and, as soon as conditions allow, to make progress towards a situation where the resumption of full cooperation becomes possible.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nJ.M.
