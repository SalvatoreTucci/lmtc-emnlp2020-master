At its meeting of 19 and\u00a020\u00a0March 2009, the European Council agreed on the need to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions within the Union and to use the de Larosi\u00e8re Group\u2019s report as a basis for action.\n(5) In its Communication of 27\u00a0May 2009 entitled \u2018European Financial Supervision\u2019, the Commission set out a series of reforms to the current arrangements for safeguarding financial stability at the level of the Union, notably including the creation of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) responsible for macro-prudential oversight. The Council, on 9\u00a0June 2009, and the European Council, at its meeting of 18 and\u00a019\u00a0June 2009, supported the view of the Commission and welcomed the Commission\u2019s intention to bring forward legislative proposals so that the new framework could be fully established.\n(6) Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) established macro-prudential oversight of the financial system at the level of the Union and a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).\n(7) Given its expertise on macro-prudential issues, the European Central Bank (ECB) can make a significant contribution to the effective macro-prudential oversight of the Union\u2019s financial system.\n(8) The Secretariat of the ESRB (the Secretariat) should be ensured by the ECB and, to this effect, the ECB should provide sufficient human and financial resources. The staff of the Secretariat should therefore be subject to the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the ECB. In particular, according to the preamble of the Decision of the ECB of 9\u00a0June 1998 on the adoption of the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank as amended on 31\u00a0March 1999 (ECB/1998/4)\u00a0(4), the staff of the ECB should be recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis from among nationals of the Member States.\n(9) On 9\u00a0June 2009, the Council concluded that the ECB should provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB. As it is the task of the ESRB to cover all aspects and areas of financial stability, the ECB should involve national central banks and supervisors to provide their specific expertise. The option to confer specific tasks concerning policies relating to prudential supervision upon the ECB provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should therefore be exercised, by conferring on the ECB the task of ensuring the Secretariat to the ESRB.\n(10) The ECB should be entrusted with the task of providing statistical support to the ESRB. The collection and processing of information as set out in this Regulation and as necessary for the performance of the tasks of the ESRB should therefore fall under Article\u00a05 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the ECB, and under Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a02533/98 of 23\u00a0November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank\u00a0(5). Accordingly, confidential statistical information collected by the ECB or the European System of Central Banks should be shared with the ESRB. In addition, this Regulation should be without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\u00a0March 2009 on European statistics\u00a0(6).\n(11) The Secretariat should prepare the meetings of the ESRB and support the work of the General Board, the Steering Committee, the Advisory Technical Committee and the Advisory Scientific Committee of the ESRB. On behalf of the ESRB, the Secretariat should collect all information necessary for the achievement of the tasks of the ESRB,", "main_body": ["Membership\nThe President and Vice-President of the European Central Bank (ECB) shall be Members of the General Board of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) as set up by Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010.", "Support of the ESRB\nThe ECB shall ensure a Secretariat, and thereby provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB.
