project ACROPOLIS has delivered an IT tool accessible to all stakeholders involved in the pesticide risk assessment. The IT tool is based on probabilistic modelling of exposure. The Commission intends to upgrade this project.\nObjective: Upgrading the ACROPOLIS tool, towards specific needs of the Commission, as well as support to risk managers in developing the criteria used in risk management by assessing the possible impact on risk management decisions of different choices of parameters used in the modelling.\nThe initial project was conducted by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM), to whom an additional grant should be awarded in order to upgrade the work and provide the necessary support to the Commission needed for taking the appropiate risk management decisions.\nExpected results: Tool upgraded to the specific needs requested by the Commission and support (test cases and instructions) given to the Commission with a view of taking risk mangement decisions regarding the calculation parameters.\nAdditional grant to OIE for regional seminars in the Animal Welfare area\nCommission Implementing Decision 2014/C 166/05 sets up a direct grant to OIE for actions such as global conferences, regional seminars and regional meetings and activities on animal health and welfare.\nThe Commission intends to award an additional direct grant to OIE for organising additional seminars in the animal welfare area.\nObjective: To increase the awareness on animal welfare issues and the degree of application of OIE animal welfare standards (transport, slaughter, control of stray dogs).\nExpected result: Increased awareness of the standards on animal welfare issues.\nCoordination of the authorisation requests for minor uses of plant protection products\nAs regards minor uses of plant protection products, it is necessary to ensure an effective coordination and information sharing among Member States and stakeholders. This would require a project of setting up a dedicated platform of EU experts on minor uses in the field of plant health. The Commission submitted a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the establishment of a European fund for minor uses in the field of plant protection products\u00a0(1). The report concluded that the Commission is ready to assist and to financially contribute in the short and medium term to the creation of such a project.\nObjective: Co-financing with an action grant of an EU coordination facility run by some Member States or an international organisation with the objective to get a coordinated approach in finding solutions for minor uses gaps in the European Union.\nExpected result: Coordinated activities leading to reduced minor uses gaps in plant protection products, in order to ensure that the European farmer continues to be able to produce high quality crops, by providing sufficient means and methods.\nCoordinated Control Plan to establish the prevalence of fraudulent practices in the marketing of certain foods\nCoordinated Control Plans have a view to establishing the prevalence of fraudulent practices in the marketing of certain foods, through targeted controls including laboratory analysis by Member States. Similar exercises had been carried out for horse meat in 2013 and in 2014.\nObjective: Detecting and quantifying some fraudulent practices.\nExpected result: Harmonized control plans for monitoring food fraud in order to increase consumers confidence. In this respect the European Commission will ask all Member States to implement such plans.\nCoordinated Control Plan for antimicrobial resistance (AMR)\nDirective 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) provides that Member States shall ensure that monitoring provides comparable data on the occurrence of AMR in zoonotic agents and, in so far as they present a threat to public health, other agents. A similar exercise has been carried out in 2014, and it is still ongoing.\nIn 2011, the Commission had introduced a 5 year action plan against AMR\u00a0(3). One of the actions is to strengthen surveillance systems on AMR and antimicrobial consumption on animal medicine.\nObjective: Co-financing of the coordinated control plan for antimicrobial resistance monitoring which will include all the Member States.\nExpected result: Harmonized control plan for monitoring resistance in the food chain in order to increase consumers confidence and assess evolution of resistance in the food chain. In this respect, the Commission will ask all Member States to implement such a plan.\n2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation\nCumulative risk assessment tool for pesticides residues\nImplementation: directly by DG SANCO.\nMaximum EU co-financing rate: 50 % of the eligible costs.\nAward criteria:\nQuality and relevance of the tools proposed;\nOverall quality, coherence and clarity of the proposed objectives.\nAdditional grant to OIE for regional meetings and activities of the Animal Welfare Platform\nImplementation: directly by DG SANCO.\nMaximum EU co-financing rate: 50 % of the eligible costs.\nAward criteria:\nContribution to the achievements of the policy objectives for Animal Welfare;\nQuality of the events proposed.\nCoordination the authorisation requests for minor uses of plant protection products\nImplementation: directly by DG SANCO.\nMaximum EU co-financing rate: 50 % of the eligible costs.\nAward criteria:\nRelevance of the proposal to the objectives of the action;\nConsistency and adequacy of resources allocated.\nEU Coordinated Control Plan to establish the prevalence of fraudulent practices in the marketing of certain foods\nImplementation: directly by DG SANCO.\nMaximum EU co-financing rate: 50 % of the eligible costs.\nAward criteria:\nRelevance of the proposal to the objectives of the action;\nNumber of tests in the proposal compared with the number of tests recommended.\nCoordinated Control Plan for antimicrobial resistance\nImplementation: directly by DG SANCO.\nMaximum EU co-financing rate: 50 % of the eligible costs.\nAward criteria:\nRelevance of the proposal to the objectives of the action;\nNumber of tests in the proposal compared with the number of tests recommended.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCUREMENTS\nThe overall budgetary allocation reserved for procurement contracts:\nin 2014 amounts to EUR 4\u00a0650\u00a0000,\nin 2015 amounts to EUR 1\u00a0205\u00a0000.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal Basis\nArticles 6(5), 34, 35, 43 of Regulation (EU) No 652/2014.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Budget line\nbudget 2014 \u2014 17 04 01 \u2014 4\u00a0600\u00a0000 EUR\nbudget 2014 \u2014 17 04 03 \u2014 50\u00a0000 EUR\nbudget 2015 \u2014 17 04 03 \u2014 1\u00a0205\u00a0000 EUR\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indicative list of envisaged contracts\nAction Type of contracts Estimated nr of contracts Indicative date Amount\nRenewal of stocks of FMD virus antigens in the EU antigen and vaccine bank Call of tender 1 4th Q 2014 4\u00a0600\u00a0000\nAction Type of contracts Estimated nr of contracts Indicative date Amount\nCommunication on eradication programmes Specific/service with existing framework contract 2 4th Q 2014 50\u00a0000\nActions Type of contracts Estimated nr of contracts Indicative date Amount\nStudy \u2014 Risk assessment of quality pests Service/Negotiated procedure 1 1st Q 2015 300\u00a0000\nDevelopment of a prototype instrument for detecting boar taint to be used in slaughterhouses Specific/service with existing framework contract 1 1st Q 2015 170\u00a0000\nEvents as part of EXPO Milan 2015 Specific/service with a future framework contract 15 1st Q 2015 500\u00a0000\nEvaluate criteria options for identifying endocrine disruptors in the context of an Impact Assessment (screening) Specific/service with existing framework contract 1 1st Q 2015 235\u00a0000\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementation\nThe actions will be implemented directly by DG SANCO.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OTHER ACTIONS\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reimbursements of accommodation and travel costs of national experts carrying out audits together with the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO)\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal Basis\nArticle 32 of Regulation (EU) No 652/2014.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Budget line\nbudget 2015 \u2014 17 04 03 \u2014 400\u00a0000 EUR.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indicative list of envisaged other actions\nAction Estimated no of other actions Indicative date Indicative amount\nReimbursements of accommodation and travel costs of experts carrying out audits together with the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) 130 Throughout 2015 400\u00a0000\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0COM(2014) 82 final, Brussels, 18.2.2014.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC (OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 31).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0COM(2011) 748 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, Action plan against the rising threats from Antimicrobial Resistance."}
