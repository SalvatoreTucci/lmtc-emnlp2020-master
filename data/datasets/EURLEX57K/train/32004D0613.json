As the group will be consulted in particular on the Commission's programme of work, it will in practice be essential for it to embrace the representative bodies that are the most capable of protecting, at European level, general interests connected with the food chain and animal and plant health.\n(15) To ensure that the group works efficiently and transparently, its operating procedures should include the possibility of organising working group meetings which would be open to other interested parties or bodies, where necessary.\n(16) In the interests of clarity, Decision 80/1073/EEC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["An advisory group on the food chain and animal and plant health, hereinafter called \u2018the group\u2019, shall be set up and attached to the Commission.", "Tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall consult the group on its programme of work in the following fields:\n\u2014 food and feed safety,\n\u2014 food and feed labelling and presentation,\n\u2014 human nutrition, in relation to food legislation,\n\u2014 animal health and welfare,\n\u2014 matters relating to crop protection, plant protection products and residues thereof, and conditions for the marketing of seed and propagation material, including biodiversity, and including matters pertaining to industrial property.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Commission will be able to consult the group on any measures which the Commission has to take or propose in these fields.", "Composition of the group\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The group shall be composed of no more than 45 representatives of representative European bodies.
