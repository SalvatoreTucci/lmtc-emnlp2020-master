Reference to that Regulation should therefore be inserted in Directive 92/65/EEC which establishes the animal health requirements applicable to trade in those animals.\n(5) Moreover, experience in the application of Directive 92/65/EEC has shown that carrying out the clinical examination of an animal within 24 hours before dispatch is in most cases impracticable. It is therefore appropriate to extend the time limit laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC to 48 hours, as recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health.\n(6) The Commission considers that in this particular case it is not justified to ask Member States to communicate explanatory documents to the Commission in order to explain the relationship between the provisions of this Directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition documents. This Directive provides for a very limited number of amendments to Directive 92/65/EEC, which should make it possible for the Commission to obtain the information regarding transposition without devoting significant resources to that task. Member States should, in any event, transmit the text of the transposed measures to the Commission.\n(7) Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 92/65/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Article 10 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(a) satisfy the conditions set out in Article 6 and, where applicable, in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on the non-commercial movement of pet animals\u00a0(7);\n(b) undergo a clinical examination carried out within 48 hours prior to the time of dispatch of the animals by a veterinarian authorised by the competent authority; and\n(c) be accompanied during transport to the place of destination by a health certificate which:\n(i) corresponds to the specimen in Part 1 of Annex E; and\n(ii) is signed by an official veterinarian who shall attest that the veterinarian authorised by the competent authority has documented in the relevant section of the identification document in the format provided for in Article 21(1) of Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 the clinical examination carried out in accordance with point (b) showing, at the time of the clinical examination, that the animals are fit to be transported for the intended journey in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations\u00a0(8).\n(b) paragraph 3 is deleted;\n(2) in Article 16, the second and third paragraphs are replaced by the following:", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 28 December 2014, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
