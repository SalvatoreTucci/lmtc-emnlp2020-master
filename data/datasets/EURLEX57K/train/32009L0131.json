It is necessary for all the parameters of a vehicle that are to be checked in connection with the authorisation for placing in service and the classification of national rules to be covered by the list of parameters. Therefore parameters of other subsystems that are part of the vehicle should be included.\n(4) Directive 2008/57/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["Section 1 of Annex VII to Directive 2008/57/EC is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed to comply with this Directive by 19\u00a0July 2010.
