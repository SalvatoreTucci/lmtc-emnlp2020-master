The increased taxation as well as the high rise of costs due to the rise of the international price of crude oil had severe negative repercussions on the activities in the road transport sector. The introduction of compensatory measures to avert serious economic and social difficulties for the road sector, which suffers from market fragmentation and from Italy's morphology, was necessary awaiting measures at infrastructural level. No other remedy was adequate.\n(6) The measure is not discriminatory. The fact that some firms or sectors benefit from certain tax measures does not in itself mean that they are in form or substance contrary to the common interest.\n(7) The measure is temporary and will expire on 31 December 2002. With effect from 1 July 2001, the refundable amount has been substantially reduced.\n(8) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the economic and social difficulties of the road transport sector concerned which has arisen, to be compatible with the common market,", "main_body": ["The measures adopted by Italy in accordance with Article 1 of Decision 2000/446/EC and Article 2 of Decision 2001/224/EC shall be considered to be compatible with the common market.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
