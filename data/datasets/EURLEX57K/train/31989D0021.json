The investigation is to take account of movement to and from the infected site of persons, livestock, vehicles, meat and any other material which may carry the African swine fever virus;\n(b) herds identified as possibly infected as a result of the epidemiological investigation are to be declared prohibited immediately and must undergo a clinical, serological and virological examination as appropriate;\n(c) a protection zone with a radius of three kilometres is to be established and signs are to be set up on all major roads to mark the borders of the zone;\nWhereas, in addition, in areas designated as qualifying under a derogation relating to intra-Community trade, the systematic slaughter policy must entail, without prejudice to restrictive measures to be implemented in trade:\n- a surveillance zone for swine with a radius of at least 10 kilometres, taking into account geographical boundaries. The zone must be established for at least 30 days. Swine may not leave the holdings on which they are kept during the first 15 days. Between the 15th day and the 30th day the pigs may not leave the holding except to be transported under official supervision directly to a slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter.

Only swine intended far slaughter, however, must undergo a serological examination, when the serological screening programme referred to in the following indent has been completed on the holding in question without African swine fever antibodies being detected;\n- all herds within the surveillance zone are to be subject to a serological screening programme for African swine fever,\n- meat originating from swine sent to a slaughterhouse in accordance with the provisions in the first indent may only be used in meat products which have undergone in the course of manufacture treatments as referred to in Article 4 (1) (a) of Directive 80/215/EEC,\n- movements of fresh meat and meat products excepting products which have undergone treatments as referred to in Article 4 (1) (a) of Directive 80/215/EEC from the protection zone are to be prohibited for 30 days;\nWhereas, in the light of the commitments referred to in the above recitals, provisions may be made for a derogation from the prohibitions relating to African swine fever for certain parts of the territory of Spain;\nWhereas, provision should be made for a period of time before authorizing the Kingdom of Spain to consign live swine, fresh meat and certain meat products from certain parts of its territory;\nWhereas, where African swine fever breaks out in one or more areas in that part of Spain qualifying under a derogation from prohibitions relating to African swine fever, the Member States are to continue to be able to adopt the necessary protective measures, in particular, under Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC, Article 8 of Directive 72/461/EEC and Article 7 of Directive 80/215/EEC;\nWhereas the Standing Veterinary Committee has not delivered a favourable opinion,", "main_body": ["1.
