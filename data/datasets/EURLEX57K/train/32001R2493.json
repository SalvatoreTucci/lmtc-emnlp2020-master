Financial compensation may be granted provided this requirement as to the disposal of products is met.\n(2) Market stabilisation measures can be fully effective only if the withdrawn products are not reintroduced into the usual distribution network for those products. Any use which could, by substitution, influence the consumption of products which have not been the subject of market stabilisation measures must therefore be ruled out.\n(3) It is therefore necessary to provide for options for disposing of products withdrawn from the market which meet that requirement and to specify the terms on which those options may be used.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83 of 9 June 1983 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been the subject of measures to stabilise the market(2) should therefore be repealed and replaced.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["1.

Disposal options other than those provided for in paragraph 1 may be authorised by the Commission on an ad hoc basis at the request of a Member State.", "1. Disposal of the products for the purposes indicated in Article 1(1)(b), (c), (d) or (e) shall be subject to the condition that the products are:\n(a) rendered unfit for human consumption immediately after their withdrawal from the market;\n(b) offered for sale open to any interested operators in accordance with customary regional and local practice. Purchasers must specify the use to which they undertake to put the products so purchased.\n2. An invoice or receipt shall be issued immediately following the sale referred to in paragraph 1, indicating the identity of the vendor and purchaser, the use to which the products are to be put, the selling price and the quantities concerned. A copy of that invoice or receipt shall be sent by the producer organisation to the competent authorities of the Member State at least every three months.\n3. Where producer organisations have satisfied the Member State concerned that the products have not found a purchaser since the offer for sale as provided for in paragraph 1, the products shall be rendered unusable by the producer organisations under the control of the Member State.
