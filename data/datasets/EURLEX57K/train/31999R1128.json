whereas it is necessary to adopt, on a multiannual basis, for 12-month periods beginning on 1 July, hereinafter called the \"year of import\", detailed rules of application; whereas, to that end, the annual arrangements provided for in the past for that quota should be applied;\n(2) Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantitioes available should be reserved for \"traditional\" importers of live bovine animals; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by traders to this part of the quota; whereas there should be provision to correct any harm caused;\n(3) Whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for traders able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals with third countries; whereas, in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported and/or imported during the 12 months preceding the year of import in question by the traders concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable;\n(4) Whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is registered for VAT purposes;\n(5) Whereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to \"traditional\" traders no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 June preceding the year of import in question;\n(6) Whereas it should be stipulated that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied;\n(7) Whereas, to ensure orderly importation, the issue of the licences should be staggered over the year of import;\n(8) Whereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences; whereas, to this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 168/1999(7), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2648/98(9);\n(9) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["With the exception of imports under the tariff quotas for the importation of 169000 young male bovine animals for fattening and 153000 live bovine animals weighing between 80 and 300 kilograms, imports into the Community of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 21, 0102 90 29, 0102 90 41 and 0102 90 49 and referred to in Article 1(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68(10), originating in the countries listed in Annex I, shall be subject to the management measures laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
