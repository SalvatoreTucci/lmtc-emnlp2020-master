whereas the aid is therefore incompatible with Community rules;\nWhereas, in view of the foregoing, the Commission, by letter of 25 March 1983, initiated the procedure laid down in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the abovementioned measures and gave notice to the Italian Government to submit its comments;\nWhereas the Commission gave notice to the other Member States and to the parties concerned other than Member States to submit their comments;\nIII\nWhereas, in their replies to the letter of notice, the Italian authorities gave no formal assurances that the maximum rates requested by the Commission in the case of the investment aids arising out of the application of Articles 39 and 42 of the Law would be complied with; whereas, furthermore, the Italian authorities gave no information liable to change the position of the Commission wih regard to the aid arising out of Article 51;\nIV\nWhereas, as regards the aids arising out of the application of Articles 39 and 42 of the Law, the Commission has made a clear distinction in previous statements of its position between on the one hand, projects forming part of national or regional programmes approved by the Commission pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3164/82 (2), located in less-favoured areas within the meaning of Council Directive 75/268/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 82/786/EEC (4), for which aid of up to 75 % of the total investment may be granted, and on the other, projects located outside these areas or not forming part of such programmes, which should be subsidized for up to 50 % of the total investment only; whereas these aids of a very high level must nevertheless leave a sufficient share for the recipient of the aid in the financing of the project; whereas a financial participation of 25 % or 50 % should be a minimum below which there is a risk of activities developing which could affect trade to an extent contrary to the common interest, by setting up enterprises which operated at a loss and which could not survive for long without further aid, while producing products which could not necessarily be disposed of without EAGGF intervention;\nWhereas the subsidy for the purchase of durum wheat by millers, arising out of the application of Article 51 of the Law, is an operating aid with no lasting beneficial effect on structures; whereas the abovementioned measure artificially favours Sicilian producers in relation to those in other regions of Italy and other Member States and is therefore liable to affect trade between Member States;\nWhereas it follows from the above that the aids decided upon by the Italian authorities are liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty;\nWhereas Article 92 (1) of the Treaty states that aids of the type mentioned therein are essentially incompatible with the common market;\nWhereas the prohibition contained in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty may not be waived under Article 92 (2), since the exceptions set out therein are clearly not applicable in the present case;\nWhereas the exceptions to incompatibility set out in Article 92 (3) stipulate that the objectives must serve the Community interest and not only that of specific sectors of the national economy; whereas these exceptions must be interpreted strictly when examining any programme of aid for a particular region or sector or any individual case of the application of general aid schemes; whereas exceptions may be granted only in cases where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary for the achievement of one of the objectives set out in those provisions;\nWhereas allowing these exceptions in respect of aids not offering such an offsetting benefit would amount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without justification from the point of view of the Community interest, and would lead to an unfair advantage for certain Member States;\nWhereas, in the case in point, the investment aids, where they exceed the limits prescribed above, and the aid for the purchase of durum wheat by millers, give no evidence of an offsetting benefit; whereas the Italian authorities were unable to provide any justification, and the Commission could find none, showing that the aids in question fulfilled the conditions for allowing one of the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty;\nWhereas none of these measures is liable to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious under-employment, to promote the execution of a project of common European interest, or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the Member State in question, and accordingly Article 92 (3) (a) and (b) of the Treaty is not applicable;\nWhereas enterprises set up as a result of excessive aids may prove not to be viable and to be unable to survive without further aid, while producing products which are in surplus, the disposal of which may increase the financial burden on the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; whereas these aids are therefore liable to affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest;\nWhereas, moreover, the subsidy for the purchase of durum wheat is an operating aid for the recipient enterprises of a purely protective nature; whereas, in general, the Commission has always been opposed to such aids since, as a rule, they do not in themselves fulfil the conditions for eligibility for the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty, as they are not likely to facilitate development as laid down in that provision;\nWhereas, moreover, in view of the comparable economic situation facing enterprises in all Member States, with stagnating or falling incomes and sharply rising production costs, and taking into account the considerable or even fierce intra-Community competition in most agricultural products, these aids are liable to affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest;\nWhereas, accordingly, there is no factor which would enable the Commission to declare that the measures under study are not incompatible, by invoking the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty;\nWhereas, in view of the foregoing, these aid measures do not fulfil the conditions required for eligibility for one of the exceptions under Article 92 (3) of the Treaty;\nWhereas this Decision does not prejudice the consequences the Commission may draw from the payment of the abovementioned aids as regards the financing of the common agricultural policy by the EAGGF,", "main_body": ["1.
