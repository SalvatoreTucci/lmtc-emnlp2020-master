Therefore, Venezuela did not fulfil all the necessary requirements under Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 to be granted the special incentive arrangement. Decision 2008/938/EC should be amended accordingly, while providing for an appropriate transitional period for its application. In accordance with Article 214 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3), any customs debt incurred with the benefit of Decision 2008/938/EC until the date of application of this Decision will therefore not be affected.\n(5) The Generalised Preferences Committee has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chairman; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 2 April 2009 in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC\u00a0(4), the Council being required to act within three months.\n(6) However, the Council has confirmed on 18 May 2009 that there is no qualified majority in favour of or against the proposal, and that the Commission may proceed in accordance with Article 5(6), last subparagraph of Decision 1999/468/EC, therefore a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, this Decision is to be notified to Venezuela,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Decision 2008/938/EC, the words \u2018(VE) Venezuela\u2019 are deleted.", "This decision shall apply from the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nCatherine ASHTON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0211, 6.8.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0334, 12.12.2008, p.\u00a090.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0302, 19.10.1992, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0184, 17.7.1999, p.\u00a023."}
