This may lead to a substantial reduction in the quantities allocated per applicant, thereby reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme. In addition, where the quantities allocated to each operator are very small, experience has shown that there is a risk of an operator in such circumstances being unable to fulfil his obligation to export with the consequent loss of the security.\n(4) In order to deal with that situation, it is appropriate to apply a combination of the three criteria referred to in Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999. In accordance with points (a) and (b) of that Article, licences should be allocated in preference to applicants which have already been engaged in the United States of America whose designated importers are subsidiaries and which have exported quantity of the concerned products to that destination in the past. In addition a reduction coefficient should be applied pursuant to point (c) of the said Article 20(3).\n(5) In the case of product groups and quotas for which the quantities applied for exceed only slightly those available, the application of a combination of the criteria provided for in Article 20(3)(b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is sufficient to allocate economically viable quantities. Therefore preference should be accorded in such circumstances to applicants whose importers are subsidiaries, while applying a reduction coefficient.\n(6) In the case of product groups and quotas for which the applications lodged are for quantities less than those available, it is appropriate, in accordance with Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, to provide for the allocation of the remaining quantities to the applicants in proportion to the quantities applied for. The allocation of such further quantities should be conditional upon the interested operator making a request and lodging a security.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["1.
