Those amounts do not relate to expenditure incurred more than 24 months before the Commission's written notification of the results of the checks to the Member States.\n(7) As regards the cases covered by this Decision, the assessment of the amounts to be excluded on grounds of non-compliance with the Community rules was notified by the Commission to the Member States in a summary report on the subject.\n(8) This Decision is without prejudice to any financial conclusions that the Commission may draw from the judgments of the Court of Justice in cases pending on 31 March 2001 and relating to the subject thereof,", "main_body": ["The expenditure itemised in the Annex that has been incurred by the Member States' accredited paying agencies and declared under the EAGGF Guarantee Section is hereby excluded from Community financing because it does not comply with the Community rules.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 July 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.\n(2) OJ L 125, 8.6.1995, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 158, 8.7.1995, p. 6.\n(4) OJ L 273, 23.10.1999, p. 5.\n(5) OJ L 182, 16.7.1994, p. 45.\n(6) OJ L 272, 25.10.2000, p. 41.\nANNEX\nTOTAL CORRECTIONS\n>TABLE>\nTOTAL CORRECTIONS IN EURO\n>TABLE>"}
