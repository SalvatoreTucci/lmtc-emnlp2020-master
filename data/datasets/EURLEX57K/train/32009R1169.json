The purpose is, as explained in recital 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, to avoid multiple applications in respect of claims which have already been assessed and subject to the authorisation procedure. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify among the modalities of presentation of an application, also the rules on withdrawals of applications as well as the time limits to submit a request for withdrawal.\n(3) The applicant should only be allowed to withdraw an application up to the moment the Authority adopts its opinion pursuant to Article 16(1) or Article 18(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such time limit is necessary in order to preserve the usefulness of the Authority\u2019s evaluation of claims and the effectiveness of the procedure for authorisation and rejection of claims and to avoid the submission of applications on claims which have already been assessed. In this respect, only withdrawals of applications submitted according to the conditions set out in the present Regulation can put an end to the authorisation procedure, which otherwise will continue after the Authority has issued its opinion.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Commission Regulation (EC) No 353/2008\u00a0(2) is amended as follows:\n1. the following Article 7a is inserted after Article 7:\n(i) for applications submitted under Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 the health claim is a health claim concerning the reduction of disease risk claims or referring to children\u2019s development and health;\n(ii) for applications submitted under Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 the health claim is any health claim as referred to in Article 13(5) of that Regulation with the exception of health claims referring to children\u2019s development and health.\u2019;\n2. the following Article 7b is inserted after Article 7a:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 19.4.2008, p. 11."}
