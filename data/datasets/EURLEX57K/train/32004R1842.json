Following Article 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 Germany had to discontinue the use of the unregistered name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 at the latest on 21 June 2001.\n(2) Article 13(5) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, as added by Council Regulation (EC) No 692/2003\u00a0(3), provides for the coexistence of a registered and an unregistered name under very strict conditions and for a limited time period.\n(3) On 1 October 2003 the Commission received a request of the German administration to allow coexistence for fifteen years of the registered name \u2018Munster or Munster-G\u00e9rom\u00e9\u2019 (PDO) and the unregistered name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019.\n(4) M\u00fcnster is a town in Germany and the name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 has been subject to national legislation in Germany since 1934 and no information has been found that the name has not been in legal use consistently and equitably for at least 25 years prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on 26 July 1993.\n(5) Cheese with the name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 has been marketed since 1951 in conformity with German national legislation on cheese qualities. Therefore, the unregistered name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 could not profit from the reputation of the designation of origin \u2018Munster or Munster-G\u00e9rom\u00e9\u2019 which was registered in France in 1969 and under Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 in 1996.\n(6) In order to prevent the public from being misled as to the true origin, the label of the cheese \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 indicates Germany as the country of origin, as agreed in 1973 between Germany and France. The labelling obligation continued under Article 13(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92. No information is found that the public has been or could be misled as to the true origin of the cheese M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se.\n(7) The German authorities raised the problem resulting from the inclusion of identical names by letter of 6 March 1996 to the Commission and, therefore, before the registration of the name \u2018Munster or Munster-G\u00e9rom\u00e9\u2019 (PDO) by Regulation (EC) No 1107/96 on 21 June 1996.\n(8) Therefore, the coexistence of the registered French name \u2018Munster or Munster-G\u00e9rom\u00e9\u2019 (PDO) and the unregistered name M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se designating a place in Germany meets the conditions set in Article 13(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Designations of Origin and Geographical Indications,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019 shall be allowed to coexist with the name \u2018Munster or Munster-G\u00e9rom\u00e9\u2019 registered as a Protected Designation of Origin under Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period of coexistence shall expire fifteen years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, after which the unregistered name shall cease to be used.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Germany as the country of origin shall be clearly and visibly indicated on the label of cheese bearing the name \u2018M\u00fcnster K\u00e4se\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 October 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 208, 24.7.1992, p. 1.
