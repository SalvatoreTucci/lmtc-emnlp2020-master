The justification of their request was that in view of the remoteness of those islands, the economic operators suffer severe economic and commercial disadvantages which have negative effects on demographic trends, employment and social and economic developments.\n(3) The Canary Islands industrial sector, together with construction, has been severely affected by the recent economic crisis. The slump in building depressed all the auxiliary industry that depends on it. Unfavourable financial conditions had a serious impact on many areas of business. In addition, the sharp rise in unemployment in Spain aggravated the slump in domestic demand, including demand for industrial products.\n(4) Unemployment in the Canary Islands has been consistently exceeding the national average for Spain for the last 10 years and, since 2009, the Canary Islands have recorded the highest level throughout the country (Eurostat: Regional statistics \u2014 Unemployment rate, by NUTS 2 regions, 1999-2009). Moreover, more than half of the industrial production of the Canary Islands is consumed there, which is particularly serious since demand there has been hit harder.\n(5) Therefore, with the aim of giving a long-term perspective to investors and enabling economic operators to reach a level of industrial and commercial activities which stabilises the economic and social environment on the Canary Islands, it is appropriate to prolong in full the suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties for certain goods as detailed in Annex II and Annex III to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0704/2002 for a period of 10 years.\n(6) In addition, in the same context the Spanish authorities have requested the suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties for three new products falling within CN codes 3902\u00a010, 3903\u00a011 and 3906\u00a010. This request was accepted as these suspensions would strengthen the economy of the Canary Islands.\n(7) In order to ensure that only economic operators located on the territory of the Canary Islands benefit from those tariff measures, the suspensions should be made conditional on the end-use of the products, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5).\n(8) In case of a deflection of trade and in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission allowing the Commission to temporarily withdraw the suspension. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers\u00a0(6).\n(9) Amendments to the Combined Nomenclature may not give rise to any substantive changes to the nature of the suspension of duties. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should therefore be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of making necessary amendments and technical adaptations to the list of goods for which a suspension applies. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the Council.\n(10) In order to ensure continuity with the measures set out in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0704/2002, it is necessary to apply the measures provided in this Regulation from 1 January 2012,", "main_body": ["From 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021, the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of capital goods for commercial or industrial use falling under the CN codes listed in Annex I shall be suspended in full.\nThose goods shall be used in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 and of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93 for a period of at least 24 months after the release into free circulation by economic operators located in the Canary Islands.", "From 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021, the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of raw materials, parts and components falling under the CN codes listed in Annex II and used for industrial transformation or maintenance in the Canary Islands, shall be suspended in full.", "The suspension of duties referred to in Articles 1 and 2 shall be subject to end-use in accordance with Articles 21 and 82 of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 and to the controls provided for in Articles 291 to 300 of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the Commission has reasons to believe that the suspensions laid down in this Regulation have led to a deflection of trade for a specific product, it may adopt implementing acts, temporarily withdrawing the suspension for a period not longer than 12 months. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 8.\nImport duties for products for which the suspension has been temporarily withdrawn shall be secured by a guarantee, and the release of the products concerned for free circulation in the Canary Islands shall be conditional upon the provision of such guarantee.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Council decides, in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Treaty, within a 12-month period, that the suspension should definitively be withdrawn, the amounts of duties secured by guarantees shall be collected definitively.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no definitive decision has been adopted within the 12-month period in accordance with paragraph 2, the securities shall be released.", "The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 6 concerning amendments and technical adaptations to Annexes I and II as are required as a consequence of amendments to the Combined Nomenclature.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power to adopt the delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power to adopt the delegated acts referred to in Article 5 shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time as from 1 January 2012.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The delegation of power referred to in Article 5 may be revoked at any time by the Council.
