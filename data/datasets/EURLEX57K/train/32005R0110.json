Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should be limited.\n(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 2000, 2001 and 2002 fishing years.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,", "main_body": ["The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be granted for the period from 1 October to 31 December 2003 in respect of the following products:\nProduct Maximum allowance\nYellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each 24", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total quantities on which the allowance for this species is payable shall be:\n\u2014 yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each: 11\u00a0433,536 tonnes.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The allocation of the total quantity among the producer organisations concerned shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 17, 21.1.2000, p. 22.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 351, 28.12.2002, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 293, 10.11.2001, p. 11.\nANNEX\nAllocation among producer organisations of quantities of tuna on which the compensatory allowance is payable for the period from 1 October to 31 December 2003 in accordance with Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, broken down by compensation percentage band\n(tonnes)\nYellowfin (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each Quantity Quantity Total quantity on which compensation is payable\nOPAGAC 1\u00a0880,530 0 1\u00a0880,530\nOPTUC 3\u00a0837,843 445,778 4\u00a0283,621\nOP 42 (CAN.) 0 0 0\nORTHONGEL 4\u00a0720,123 549,262 5\u00a0269,385\nAPASA 0 0 0\nMadeira 0 0 0\nEU \u2014 Total 10\u00a0438,496 995,040 11\u00a0433,536"}
