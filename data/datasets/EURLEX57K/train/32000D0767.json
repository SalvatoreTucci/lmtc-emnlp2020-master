France acting as nominated rapporteur Member State submitted to the Commission on 6 January 1998 the draft assessment report concerned. The submitted report is being reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and in working groups thereof.\n(8) For flumioxazine, the effects on human health and the environment are being assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of the Directive, for the uses proposed by the applicant. France acting as nominated rapporteur Member State submitted to the Commission on 20 January 1998 the draft assessment report concerned. The submitted report is being reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and in working groups thereof.\n(9) It will not be possible to complete the evaluation of the dossiers within three years of the adoption of the decisions on completeness referred to above because the examination of the dossiers after submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member State, France, have been subject to longer time periods than the Community average for new active substance evaluation.\n(10) The evaluation processes for both applications have been examined according to a set of assessment criteria. From this analysis it would appear that the longer time periods for the Community evaluation have been due to factors essentially not due to the two applicants referred to above.\n(11) To enable the assessment of the FOE 5043 (flufenacet) and flumioxazine to continue, and to permit plant-protection products containing these active substances to continue to be made provisionally available for use in agriculture, Member States should therefore be permitted to prolong authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances granted under Article 8(1) of the Directive.\n(12) An extension of 12 months is proposed in both cases, as this should be sufficient to allow the completion of the evaluation and decision making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion.\n(13) Such provisions to extend the possible time limits for provisional authorisations should be seen as a temporary measure. The Commission has already taken steps to improve the efficiency of the evaluation system with a view to complete the evaluation of a new active substance within a period of three years from the date of publication of the completeness.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Member States may extend provisional authorisations already granted for plant-protection products containing FOE 5043 (flufenacet) and flumioxazine for a period not exceeding 12 months from the date of adoption of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2000.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 276, 28.10.2000, p. 41.\n(3) OJ L 152, 11.6.1997, p. 31.\n(4) OJ L 262, 24.9.1997, p. 7."}
