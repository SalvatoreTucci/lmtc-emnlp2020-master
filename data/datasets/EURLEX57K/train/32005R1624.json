Pursuant to those Regulations, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus should ensure through appropriate checks that products covered by this Regulation are not subject to export refunds and intervention measures.\n(5) Since the level of refunds paid for the export from the Community of citrus fruits is low, the risk of fraud under the measures provided for in this Regulation is limited. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus should, nevertheless, ensure that the rule of Community origin as set out in the second indent of Article 35(9) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and in Article 11(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(6) is complied with.\n(6) In accordance with Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1480/2004 of 10 August 2004 laying down specific rules concerning goods arriving from the areas not under the effective control of the Government of Cyprus in the areas in which the Government exercises effective control\u00a0(7), the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce and the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus have to communicate to the Commission the information enabling the Commission to monitor the trade flows across the \u2018green line\u2019.\n(7) Accordingly, it does not appear necessary to establish further conditions for the duty-free access of citrus fruits obtained in the areas not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 866/2004, citrus fruit crossing the line within the meaning of that Regulation falling within CN code 0805 shall not be subject to customs duties or charges having equivalent effect.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 161, 30.4.2004, p. 128.
