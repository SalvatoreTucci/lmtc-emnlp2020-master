Discarding fish before they have reproduced reduces the potential yield for future years and thus threatens the sustainability of the stocks.\n(4) Both the fleets targeting Norway lobster and the fleets using bottom trawls and seines to target mixed finfish have high levels of haddock and whiting discards due to the poor selectivity of the gears used. ICES also states that the cod stock is highly dependent on recruitment of fish, and that technical measures should be encouraged to reduce discards. With recent high recruitment in both haddock and whiting stocks in the Celtic Sea, discarding is expected to get worse this year. Consequently, ICES advises that technical measures should be introduced urgently to increase selectivity and reduce discards of haddock, whiting and cod.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to introduce the use of square-meshed panels to improve the size selectivity of the gears used and protect the juvenile fish entering the stock, whilst maintaining as much of the catches of target species as possible. Square-meshed panels have been shown to reduce fishing mortality significantly by allowing fish to escape and are an effective measure that can be introduced immediately.\n(6) In October 2011 the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council (NWWRAC) issued advice that the current technical measures in the Celtic Sea should be improved to reduce discards, especially of haddock and whiting, by requiring the use of an appropriately positioned square-meshed panel of a specified size depending on the gear type and engine power of the vessel.\n(7) Therefore, the conservation of haddock and whiting stocks in the Celtic Sea require immediate action.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall apply to fishing vessels operating with bottom trawls or seines in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions VIIf, VIIg and the part of VIIj that lies north of latitude 50\u00b0 N and east of 11\u00b0 W (hereinafter the \u2018Celtic Sea\u2019), where:\n(a) bottom trawls and seines are of single mesh size equal to or larger than 100 millimetres (hereinafter \u2018TR1 vessels\u2019);\n(b) bottom trawls and seines are of single mesh size equal or larger than 70 millimetres and less than 100 millimetres (hereinafter \u2018TR2 vessels\u2019); or\n(c) where the vessel using bottom trawls or seines has an engine power of less than 112 kilowatts (hereinafter \u2018low-powered vessels\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fishing vessels operating with beam trawls.", "Technical measures\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from point (a) of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/98, the following technical measures shall apply for vessels as referred to in Article 1:\n(a) TR1 and low-powered vessels shall use a square-meshed panel of a mesh size of at least 100 millimetres;\n(b) TR2 vessels shall use a square-meshed panel of a mesh size of at least 110 millimetres.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from point (a) of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 850/98, the square-meshed panel as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be placed into the top panel of the codend.
