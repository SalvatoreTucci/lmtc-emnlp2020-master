whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has assessed the measures needed in the whole Community in order to implement the recommendations of the abovementioned group of experts;\n(7) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has concluded that the rendering procedure using 133 \u00c2\u00b0C at 3 bar for 20 minutes is the most important factor to assure the safety of meat-and-bone meal, but that this system cannot completely guarantee the complete removal of a TSE agent present in the material to be rendered if the system is challenged with material with high infectivity;\n(8) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has stated that several Member States including the United Kingdom have reported scrapie in native-born sheep, that the presence of scrapie cannot be excluded in any Member State where sheep are present and that only a thorough epidemiological investigation conducted to common standards will give the necessary information about the scrapie status of each country;\n(9) Whereas measures must be implemented in order to protect ruminants from scrapie pending a proper epidemiological evaluation of the situation in the Community;\n(10) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has therefore recommended that specified risk materials, defined as brain, spinal cords and eyes from cattle, sheep and goats over one year of age and spleens from sheep and goats over six months of age, should be removed from all food and feed chains in countries or regions where a potential risk is identified, and that, in the case of fallen cattle, sheep and goats either the specified risk materials should be removed so that they do not enter any food or feed chain, or the whole carcase should be destroyed;\n(11) Whereas it is necessary for practical reasons to exclude the use of spleens from sheep and goats, irrespective of age, and mechanically recovered meat from the vertebral column of cattle, sheep and goats;\n(12) Whereas certain Member States have already excluded certain material from the food and feed chains; whereas the United Kingdom has prohibited tissues in addition to those recommended by the Scientific Veterinary Committee; whereas Article 3.2.13.12 of the Animal Health Code of the International Office of Epizootics recommends that bovine brains, eyes, spinal cord, tonsils, thymus, spleen and distal ileum (tissues under study) and protein products derived from them from cattle over six months of age originating from countries with a high incidence of BSE should not be traded between countries;\n(13) Whereas the United Kingdom is considered to be a country with a high incidence of BSE; whereas the tissues included on the list of specified bovine materials of the United Kingdom are in conformity with the list of the abovementioned Article of the Animal Health Code; whereas, therefore, the United Kingdom should be authorized to keep the existing national measures in respect of the removal of specified bovine material in force;\n(14) Whereas a risk analysis based on accepted scientific methodology may show that there is a significantly higher risk of exposure of animals or humans to TSEs in certain Member States; whereas those Member States may take action in respect of the removal of additional risk material of animals slaughtered on their territory;\n(15) Whereas although the situation as regards TSEs may vary between Member States, uniform rules throughout the Community should be adopted in order to ensure a high level of health protection and to avoid distortion of trade;\n(16) Whereas equivalent guarantees are required for imports from third countries; whereas the situation as regards TSEs may vary between countries and the import requirements may therefore be adapted to the particular situation of the country of origin;\n(17) Whereas Commission Directive 97/1/EC of 10 January 1997 adapting to technical progress Annexes II, III, VI and VII of Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (11) bans provisionally the marketing of cosmetic products containing bovine, ovine and caprine tissues and fluids from the encephalon, the spinal cord and the eyes, and the ingredients derived therefrom;\n(18) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision further contribute to the safe sourcing, processing and use of ruminant material for food, feed, medical and pharmaceutical products and cosmetic products;\n(19) Whereas there are no effective controls or tests which can determine whether or not particular tissues have been used in the manufacturing of products; whereas, therefore, in order to ensure that the tissues and fluids in question have not been used in the manufacture of products which are marketed in the Community, it is essential to ensure that those tissues are removed and stained at the point of production, and subsequently destroyed by incineration, following rendering where necessary; whereas such measures will also ensure that those tissues are excluded from food, feed, medical and pharmaceutical products and cosmetic products;\n(20) Whereas it is appropriate to provide for derogations to permit the use of materials covered by this Decision for teaching and research purposes and, under certain conditions, for feeding fur animals;\n(21) Whereas the Council, at its meeting of 17 December 1996, rejected by a simple majority the Commission's proposal on removal of specified risk materials;\n(22) Whereas inspections were carried out in Member States in 1996 to check the implementation of Community measures on BSE; whereas the results of those inspections are now available; whereas those inspections have revealed certain deficiencies, in particular in surveillance and implementation of the ban on use of mammalian protein in ruminant feed;\n(23) Whereas in view of previous trade in certain products, in particular meat and bone meal and live animals, the possible presence of TSE agents cannot be ruled out in any of the Member States; whereas on the basis of the results of the inspections, no Member State can therefore be considered to be free from a potential risk from TSEs;\n(24) Whereas this Decision will be reviewed in the light of new scientific information with regard to risk of exposure to TSEs resulting from infectivity in other animal species, age categories, tissues or materials, not yet covered by this Decision;\n(25) Whereas the Commission will make proposals to set up an effective TSE surveillance in the Member States;\n(26) Whereas the Standing Veterinary Committee has not delivered an opinion; whereas the Commission therefore proposed these measures to the Council on 17 July 1997 in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 89/662/EEC, the Council being required to adopt measures within 15 days;\n(27) Whereas, however, the Council has not acted within the prescribed period; whereas the Council has not decided against the proposed measures by simple majority within the prescribed period; whereas these measures should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision 'specified risk material` shall be defined as follows:\n(a) the skull, including the brain and eyes, tonsils and spinal cord of:\n- bovine animals aged over 12 months,\n- ovine and caprine animals which are aged over 12 months or have a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum;\n(b) the spleens of ovine and caprine animals.", "The use of specified risk material for any purpose shall be prohibited.", "The use of the vertebral column of bovine, ovine and caprine animals for the production of mechanically recovered meat shall be prohibited.", "1.
