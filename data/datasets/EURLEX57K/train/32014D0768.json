BAT conclusions 57 and 58 established by that Decision enable Member States to make use of an integrated emission management technique for emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from certain technical units.\n(2) Mineral oil and gas refineries are significant sources of emissions of air pollutants, in particular sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. If refineries would use an integrated emission management technique, it would become the main determining factor for the environmental performance of those refineries.\n(3) It is necessary to establish specific reporting requirements to allow the Commission to assess the correct application of BAT 57 and BAT 58 and more in particular to verify that the integrated emission management technique is designed, implemented and operated in such a way as to comply with the principles of equivalent environmental outcome as set out in those BAT conclusions.\n(4) The type of information to be made available by the Member States in relation to the implementation of integrated emission management techniques described in BAT 57 and BAT 58 should be determined and this should include the description of the significant design features of the techniques implemented, the associated emission limit values established, as well as the associated monitoring system and its results.\n(5) Under Article 72(1) of Directive 2010/75/EU, Member States are to make the information on the application of best available techniques available in an electronic format. To ensure the consistency and coherence of the information made available by the Member States, they should use the electronic reporting format developed for that purpose by the Commission as assisted by the European Environment Agency.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 75(1) of Directive 2010/75/EU,", "main_body": ["Reporting by Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall make available to the Commission the information on the implementation of the integrated emission management techniques set out in BAT 57 and BAT 58 adopted by Implementing Decision 2014/738/EU.\nThe information referred to in the first subparagraph shall be made available in accordance with the Annex and shall cover the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.
