However, no exception is provided for organic poultry.\n(3) In the light of current concerns about the spread of avian influenza, it is necessary to take account of precautionary measures which may require poultry to remain indoors. For the sake of coherence and clarity and in order to guarantee the continuity of the organic poultry production system, it is also necessary to allow producers to keep their poultry indoors without losing organic status, where restrictions, including veterinary restrictions, which are taken on the basis of Community law for the purpose of protecting public or animal health, prevent poultry from having access to the open-air or to grazing areas.\n(4) Restricting access to outdoor runs for poultry used to permanent outdoor access may compromise their welfare. In order to reduce the negative impact of such measures the animals shall have permanent access to sufficient quantities of roughage and suitable material allowing each bird to take up roughage, scratch and dust bath according to its needs.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) There is an urgent need for the measures provided for in this Regulation, considering that restrictions are already being applied in certain Member States. This Regulation should therefore enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["In part B of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 the following point 8.4.7 is added:\n\u20188.4.7.
