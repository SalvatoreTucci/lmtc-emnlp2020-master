Community demand for the products to which that Regulation applies should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose, new Community tariff quotas should be opened at zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.\n(2) The quota amounts for two autonomous Community tariff quotas are insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry. Consequently, those quota amounts should be increased.\n(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant a Community tariff quota from 1 July 2007 for one product, on which duties have been suspended until that date. The product in question should therefore be removed from the table in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(6) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 July 2007, it should enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the tariff quotas for the products set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall be inserted;\n2. the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2603, 09.2727 and 09.2977 shall be replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n3. the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2970 shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall apply from 1 July 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 25 June 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
