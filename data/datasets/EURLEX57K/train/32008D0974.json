The Hague Code of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation (hereinafter \u2018the Code\u2019 or \u2018HCoC\u2019 is an integral part of that system. It aims at preventing and curbing the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction and related technologies.\n(3) On 17 November 2003, the Council adopted Common Position 2003/805/CFSP\u00a0(1) on the universalisation and reinforcement of multilateral agreements in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of delivery. That Common Position calls, inter alia, for the promotion of the subscription of as many countries as possible to the Code, especially those with ballistic missile capabilities, as well as for the further development and implementation of the Code, especially its confidence building measures, and for the promotion of a closer relationship between the Code and the UN multilateral non-proliferation system.\n(4) On 23 May 2007, the Council decided to take action to promote the universality of the Code and compliance with its principles. To that end, a workshop was organised in the margins of the 2007 Annual Meeting of Subscribing States which brought together States with major ballistic missile capabilities, including those which did not subscribe to the Code. It is a priority of the EU to continue this dialogue among subscribing and non-subscribing States with the aim of further promoting the universality of the Code as well as its better implementation and enhancement. This Decision should contribute to this process,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of ensuring the continuous and practical implementation of certain elements of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, the EU shall support the activities of subscribing States to the Code in order to further the following objectives:\n(a) promoting the universality of the Code, and in particular the subscription to the Code by all States with ballistic missile capabilities;\n(b) supporting the implementation of the Code;\n(c) promoting further enhancement of the Code.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, the projects to be supported by the European Union shall cover the following specific activities:\n(a) providing means for the organisation of targeted outreach, for example in the form of a workshop, aiming at the promotion of new subscriptions to the Code for the region with the lowest level of subscription to the Code;\n(b) providing financial and technical means to facilitate, on the one hand, the exchange of information among subscribing States, and, on the other, a visit by international observers to Space Launch Vehicles (SLV) testing launching sites, which subscribing States have resolved to consider on a voluntary basis under Article 4a (ii) of the Code;\n(c) providing means to pursue a debate among subscribing States on how to preserve the relevance and the viability of the Code.

BARNIER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 20.11.2003, p. 34.\nANNEX\nEU support to the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objectives\nThe European Union has strongly supported the Code from its inception. The European Union considers the Code as an important multilateral instrument which aims at curbing the proliferation of ballistic missiles systems and related technologies through transparency and confidence building measures. All the European Union Member States have subscribed to the Code and are implementing the Code in good faith.\nIn the past, the European Union tried to overcome remaining loopholes in the implementation of the Code and its universality by organising a workshop of subscribing and non-subscribing States to the Code in the margins of the 2007 Annual Meeting. Encouraged by the outcome of the workshop, the European Union wishes to pursue this initiative and support three aspects of the Code as follows:\n\u2014 Universality of the Code,\n\u2014 Implementation of the Code,\n\u2014 Enhancement and improved functioning of the Code.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the projects\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 1: Promotion of the universality of the Code\n2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the project\nWhile the number of subscribing States has attained the level of two thirds of all UN Member States, more needs to be done to achieve universality of the Code. At the Annual Meetings, the subscribing States noted that the reasons behind the reluctance of non-subscribing States to subscribe to the Code vary extensively, from general lack of awareness and understanding of the Code to more political reasons.\n2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the project\n\u2014 increase awareness about, understanding and support of the Code,\n\u2014 enhance interaction among subscribing and non-subscribing States to the Code,\n\u2014 increase the number of subscribing States to the Code.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\nThe project provides for the organisation of two workshops:\n\u2014 an awareness raising workshop for the region with the greatest number of non-subscribing States.\n\u2014 a general workshop, following the model of the workshop that was organised in the margins of the 2007 Annual Meeting of subscribing States with focused and structured exchanges on technical and politico-security considerations related to ballistic missile proliferation and the relevance of the Code.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 2: Support for the implementation of the Code among subscribing States\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the project\nWhile the Code represents an important instrument for curbing the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies through confidence-building and transparency measures, more needs to be done to promote better exchanges among subscribing States. The project will focus on those aspects of exchanges where tangible results can be achieved.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the project\n\u2014 creation of a prototype of a secure internet-based information and communication mechanism (e-ICC), which could enable faster, easier and securitized exchange of information among subscribing States and provide for the electronic distribution of documents,\n\u2014 in the event that the subscribing States decide to establish an e-ICC at their Annual Meeting, such a prototype could be made operational,\n\u2014 greater support for a visit by observers to SLV testing launch sites.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\nThe project provides for two types of measures:\n(a) Facilitation of the exchange of information and communication among subscribing States through the creation of an e-ICC. The experience of France with the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) e-POC system is of particular relevance to this project.\n(b) Providing financial means for a visit of international observers to SLVs' testing launch sites of the EU Member States.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 3: Promotion of the further enhancement and improved functioning of the Code\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the project\nThe security environment is evolving constantly, including in the area of proliferation of the means capable to deliver Weapons of Mass Destruction. The subscribing States meet annually and assess the implementation of the Code as well as the new trends in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies.\nThe project will promote more in-depth discussion among subscribing States, and, when appropriate, include non-subscribing States in a more informal setting and will provide for access to technical expertise concerning ballistic missile proliferation outside governmental circles. The outcomes of the project could be submitted as a food-for-thought paper at the Annual Meeting of subscribing States.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the project\n\u2014 better understanding of current trends in ballistic missile proliferation and SLV programmes with recommendations for the subscribing States,\n\u2014 analysis of options how to motivate the subscribing States to undergo the Ballistic Missile and SLV programmes,\n\u2014 better understanding of the interface between the Code, the MTCR and bilateral and regional arrangements concerning confidence building measures in pursuit of the goal of missile non-proliferation and a definition of policy recommendations,\n\u2014 working papers or other forms of documentation from the workshops, which could be submitted by the EU to the HCoC Annual Meeting.\n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\nThe project will provide for two types of activities:\n(a) Financing of a study on the current trends in ballistic missiles and the dynamics in their proliferation, as well as SLV programmes, which could be submitted as a food-for-thought paper at the Annual Meeting of the subscribing States. In conducting this study, FRS will ensure that there is no duplication of work with the UN Group of Governmental Experts;\n(b) Financing of workshops of experts from the subscribing and non-subscribing States, both from the governmental and non-governmental sectors. The workshops could be organised in the margins of the Annual Meetings. The outcomes could be submitted as a working paper to the Annual Meeting of the subscribing States. The workshops will address the following issues:\n\u2014 The interface between the Code, the MTCR and bilateral and regional confidence building measure arrangements in pursuit of the goal of missile non-proliferation as well as between the Code and the UN system (UNGA),\n\u2014 How to motivate the subscribing States to undergo the ballistic missile and SLV programmes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Duration\nThe total estimated duration of the implementation of the projects is 24 months.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beneficiaries\nThe beneficiaries of the projects in this Decision are both subscribing and non-subscribing States to the Code.\nThe final choice of the beneficiary States will be made in consultation between the implementing entity and the Presidency, assisted by the SG/HR in close consultation with Member States and the Commission in the framework of the competent Council Working Party. The final decision will be based on proposals by the implementing entity in accordance with Article 2(2).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementing entity\nFRS will be entrusted with the technical implementation of the projects. The projects will be implemented directly by staff of the FRS or of its cooperative partners, the Institute of Peace Research and Security Policy of Hamburg University and the Polish Space Research Centre in Warsaw.\nThe implementing entity will prepare:\n(a) Quarterly reports on the implementation of the projects;\n(b) A final report not later than one month after the end of the implementation of the projects.\nReports will be sent to the Presidency, assisted by the SG/HR.\nThe FRS will ensure the visibility of the EU contribution, appropriate to its size.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third party participants\nThe projects will be financed in their entirety by the Decision. Experts from subscribing States to the Code or non-subscribing States may be considered as third party participants. They will work in accordance with the standard rules of the FRS."}
