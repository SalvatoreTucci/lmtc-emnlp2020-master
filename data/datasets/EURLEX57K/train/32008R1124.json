the varieties of hemp must have a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content not exceeding 0,2\u00a0% and Member States have to establish a system for verification of THC content in hemp.\n(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 795/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01782/2003 establishing

on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (common catalogue)\u00a0(5) the Commission has, on the basis of the information supplied by the Member States, to publish a list of all varieties of which the seed and propagating material are not subject to any marketing restrictions as regards variety.\n(4) Under Article 18 of Directive 2002/53/EC Member States may be authorised to prohibit the marketing of the seeds or propagating material of the variety in all or part of its territory if it is established that the cultivation of such variety could present a risk for human health.\n(5) Based on the Member States communications and the annual results of verification of THC content in hemp, with exception of two varieties, all the other varieties listed in common catalogue can be considered as not exceeding THC content of 0,2\u00a0% in accordance with Article 52 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n(6) In order to simplify the procedures, it is appropriate to use common catalogue as a reference tool for the hemp varieties eligible for direct payments and to establish a procedure under which it will be the responsibility of each Member State to evaluate annual analyses of THC content in hemp and adopt appropriate measures.\n(7) Regulations (EC) No 795/2004, (EC) No 796/2004 and (EC) No 1973/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures
