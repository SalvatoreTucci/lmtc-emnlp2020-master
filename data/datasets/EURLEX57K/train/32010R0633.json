The aim of the amendments to IFRIC 14 is to remove an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14 in cases where an entity subject to a minimum funding requirement makes an early payment of contributions where under certain circumstances the entity making such a prepayment would be required to recognise an expense. In the case where a defined benefit plan is subject to a minimum funding requirement the amendment to IFRIC 14 prescribes to treat this prepayment, like any other prepayment, as an asset.\n(3) The consultation with the Technical Expert Group (TEG) of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) confirms that amendments to IFRIC 14 meets the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. In accordance with Commission Decision 2006/505/EC of 14 July 2006 setting up a Standards Advice Review Group to advise the Commission on the objectivity and neutrality of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAG\u2019s) opinions\u00a0(3), the Standards Advice Review Group considered EFRAG's opinion on endorsement and advised the Commission that it is well-balanced and objective.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Accounting Regulatory Committee,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee's (IFRIC) Interpretation 14 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Each company shall apply the amendments to IFRIC 14, as set out in the Annex to this Regulation, at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting after 31 December 2010.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 320, 29.11.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 199, 21.7.2006, p. 33.\nANNEX\nINTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIFRIC 14 Amendments to IFRIC Interpretation 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement\n\u2018Reproduction allowed within the European Economic Area.

The future service cost to the entity excludes amounts that will be borne by employees.\n17 An entity shall determine the future service costs using assumptions consistent with those used to determine the defined benefit obligation and with the situation that exists at the end of the reporting period as determined by IAS 19. Therefore, an entity shall assume no change to the benefits to be provided by a plan in the future until the plan is amended and shall assume a stable workforce in the future unless the entity is demonstrably committed at the end of the reporting period to make a reduction in the number of employees covered by the plan. In the latter case, the assumption about the future workforce shall include the reduction.\nThe effect of a minimum funding requirement on the economic benefit available as a reduction in future contributions\n18 An entity shall analyse any minimum funding requirement at a given date into contributions that are required to cover (a) any existing shortfall for past service on the minimum funding basis and (b) future service.\n20 If there is a minimum funding requirement for contributions relating to future service, the economic benefit available as a reduction in future contributions is the sum of:\n(a) any amount that reduces future minimum funding requirement contributions for future service because the entity made a prepayment (ie paid the amount before being required to do so); and\n(b) the estimated future service cost in each period in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 17, less the estimated minimum funding requirement contributions that would be required for future service in those periods if there were no prepayment as described in (a).\n21 An entity shall estimate the future minimum funding requirement contributions for future service taking into account the effect of any existing surplus determined using the minimum funding basis but excluding the prepayment described in paragraph 20(a). An entity shall use assumptions consistent with the minimum funding basis and, for any factors not specified by that basis, assumptions consistent with those used to determine the defined benefit obligation and with the situation that exists at the end of the reporting period as determined by IAS 19. The\u00a0estimate shall include any changes expected as a result of the entity paying the minimum contributions when they are due. However, the estimate shall not include the effect of expected changes in the terms and conditions of the minimum funding basis that are not substantively enacted or contractually agreed at the end of the reporting period.\n22 When an entity determines the amount described in paragraph 20(b), if the future minimum funding requirement contributions for future service exceed the future IAS 19 service cost in any given period, that excess reduces the amount of the economic benefit available as a reduction in future contributions However, the amount described in paragraph 20(b) can never be less than zero.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\n27B Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement added paragraph 3A and amended paragraphs 16-18 and 20-22. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.\nTRANSITION\n29 An entity shall apply the amendments in paragraphs 3A, 16\u201318 and 20\u201322 from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the first financial statements in which the entity applies this Interpretation. If the entity had previously applied this Interpretation before it applies the amendments, it shall recognise the adjustment resulting from the application of the amendments in retained earnings at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented."}
