Furthermore, national provisions are allowed to exist alongside Union provisions.\n(4) While Council Directive 76/766/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to alcohol tables\u00a0(12) provides for a total harmonisation, most of its content is included in the Union regulations on alcohol measurement of wines and spirit drinks, namely Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 of 17 September 1990 determining Community methods for the analysis of wines\u00a0(13) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2870/2000 of 19 December 2000 laying down Community reference methods for the analysis of spirit drinks\u00a0(14). The international standards for alcohol tables are identical to those provided for in Directive 76/766/EEC and they can continue to be the basis for national regulation.\n(5) Technical progress and innovation with regard to measuring instruments covered by the Directives being repealed will be ensured in practice either by the voluntary application of the international and European standards which have been developed or by the application of national provisions laying down technical specifications based on such standards or, in line with the principles of better law-making, by including additional provisions in Directive 2004/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on measuring instruments\u00a0(15). Furthermore, the free movement within the internal market of all products concerned by the Directives being repealed is ensured by the satisfactory application of Articles 34, 35 and 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and of the mutual recognition principle.\n(6) Nevertheless, with a view to the forthcoming review of Directive 2004/22/EC, it is appropriate to set the date of repeal for seven of the Directives sufficiently far in advance to enable the European Parliament and the Council to take a different view in the context of any revision of Directive 2004/22/EC.\n(7) Directive 71/349/EEC should be repealed.\n(8) While Directives 71/317/EEC, 71/347/EEC, 74/148/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC and 86/217/EEC should also be repealed as soon as possible, they should be repealed only after an assessment as to whether the measuring instruments falling within the scope of those Directives should be included within the scope of Directive 2004/22/EC. The Commission should carry out such an assessment in parallel with its report on the implementation of Directive 2004/22/EC. In the context of that assessment, the date set for the repeal of those Directives could be brought forward, with a view to ensuring consistency in the legislative action of the Union in the field of measuring instruments. In any event, repeal of those Directives should take effect not later than 1 December 2015.\n(9) The repeal of the Directives should not lead to any new barriers to the free movement of goods or to additional administrative burdens.\n(10) The repeal of the Directives should not affect existing EC pattern approvals and EC pattern approval certificates until the end of their validity.\n(11) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(16), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,", "main_body": ["Without prejudice to Article 6(1), Directive 71/349/EEC is repealed with effect from 1 July 2011.", "Subject to Article 4 and without prejudice to Article 6(2), Directives 71/347/EEC, 75/33/EEC, 76/765/EEC, 76/766/EEC and 86/217/EEC are repealed with effect from 1 December 2015.", "Subject to Article 4 and without prejudice to Article 6(3), Directives 71/317/EEC and 74/148/EEC are repealed with effect from 1 December 2015.", "By 30 April 2011, the Commission shall, on the basis of reports provided by the Member States, evaluate whether the measuring instruments falling within the scope of the Directives referred to in Articles 2 and 3 need to be included in the scope of Directive 2004/22/EC and whether the transitional measures and date set for repeal of those Directives need to be adjusted accordingly.
