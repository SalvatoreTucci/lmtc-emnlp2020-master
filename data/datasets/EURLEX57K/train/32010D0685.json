The aggregation of single final customers and of production facilities, excluded from the definition of relevant points as described under 3.2(1)(a), shall for the application of this Annex be considered as one relevant point.\n(3) Where points between two or more transmission operators are managed solely by the transmission operators concerned, with no contractual or operational involvement of system users whatsoever, or where points connect a transmission system to a distribution system and there is no contractual congestion at these points, transmission system operators shall be exempted for these points from the obligation to publish the requirements under paragraph 3.3 of this Annex. The national regulatory authority may require the transmission system operators to publish the requirements under paragraph 3.3 of this Annex for groups or all of the exempted points. In such case, the information, if available to the TSO, shall be published in an aggregated form at a meaningful level, at least per balancing zone. This aggregation of these points shall for the application of this annex be considered as one relevant point.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information to be published at all relevant points and the time schedule according to which this information should be published\n(1) At all relevant points, transmission system operators shall publish the information as listed in paragraphs (a) to (g), for all services and ancillary services provided (in particular information on blending, ballasting and conversion). This information shall be published on a numerical basis, in hourly or daily periods, equal to the smallest reference period for capacity booking and (re-)nomination and the smallest settlement period for which imbalance charges are calculated. If the smallest reference period is different from a daily period, information as listed in paragraphs (a) to (g) shall be made available also for the daily period. This information and updates shall be published as soon as available to the system operator (\u201cnear real time\u201d).\n(a) the technical capacity for flows in both directions;\n(b) the total contracted firm and interruptible capacity in both directions;\n(c) the nominations and re-nominations in both directions;\n(d) the available firm and interruptible capacity in both directions;\n(e) actual physical flows;\n(f) planned and actual interruption of interruptible capacity;\n(g) planned and unplanned interruptions to firm services as well as the information on restoration of the firm services (in particular, maintenance of the system and the likely duration of any interruption due to maintenance). Planned interruptions shall be published at least 42 days in advance.\n(2) At all relevant points, the information under paragraph 3.3(1)(a), (b) and (d) shall be published for a period of at least 18 months ahead.\n(3) At all relevant points, transmission system operators shall publish historical information on the requirements of paragraph 3.3(1)(a) to (g) for the past 5 years on a rolling basis.\n(4) Transmission system operators shall publish measured values of the gross calorific value or the Wobbe index at all relevant points, on a daily basis. Preliminary figures shall be published at the latest 3 days following the respective gas day. Final figures shall be published within 3 months after the end of the respective month.\n(5) For all relevant points, transmission system operators shall publish available capacities, booked and technical capacities, on an annual basis over all years where capacity is contracted plus 1 year, and at least for the next 10 years. This information shall be updated at least every month or more frequently, if new information becomes available. The publication shall reflect the period for which capacity is offered to the market.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information to be published regarding the transmission system and the time schedule according to which this information should be published\n(1) Transmission system operators shall ensure the publication on a daily basis and updated every day the aggregated amounts of capacities offered, and contracted on the secondary market (i.e. sold from one network user to another network user), where the information is available to the TSO. This information shall include the following specifications:\n(a) interconnection point where the capacity is sold;\n(b) type of capacity, i.e. entry, exit, firm, interruptible;\n(c) quantity and duration of the capacity usage rights;\n(d) type of sale, e.g. transfer or assignment;\n(e) the total number of trades/transfers;\n(f) any other conditions known to the transmission system operator as mentioned in 3.3.\n(2) Transmission system operators shall publish harmonised conditions under which capacity transactions (e.g. transfers and assignments) will be accepted by them. These conditions must at least include:\n(a) a description of standardised products which can be sold on the secondary market;\n(b) lead time for the implementation/acceptation/registration of secondary trades. In case of delays the reasons have to be published;\n(c) the notification to the transmission system operator by the seller or the third party as referred to under 3.4(1) about name of seller and buyer and capacity specifications as outlined in 3.4(1).\n(3) Regarding the balancing service of its system, each transmission system operator shall provide to each network user, for each balancing period, its specific preliminary imbalance volumes and cost data per individual network user, at the latest 1 month after the end of the balancing period. Final data of customers supplied according to standardised load profiles may be provided up to 14 months later. In so far such information is provided by a third party, transmission system operators shall be exempted from this provision. The provision of this information shall respect confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n(4) Where flexibility services, other than tolerances, are offered for third party access, transmission system operators shall publish daily forecasts on a day-ahead basis of the maximum amount of flexibility, the booked level of flexibility and the availability of flexibility for the market for the next gas day. The transmission system operator shall also publish ex-post information on the aggregate utilisation of every flexibility service at the end of each gas day. If the national regulatory authority is satisfied that such information could give room to potential abuse by network users, it may decide to exempt the transmission system operator from this obligation.\n(5) Transmission system operators shall publish, per balancing zone, the amount of gas in the transmission system at the start of each gas day and the forecast of the amount of gas in the transmission system at the end of each gas day. The forecast amount of gas for the end of the gas day shall be updated on an hourly basis throughout the gas day. If imbalance charges are calculated on an hourly basis, the transmission system operator shall publish the amount of gas in the transmission system on an hourly basis. Alternatively, transmission system operators shall publish, per balancing zone, the aggregate imbalance position of all users at the start of each balancing period and the forecast of the aggregated imbalance position of all users at the end of each gas day. If the national regulatory authority is satisfied that such information could give room to potential abuse by network users, it may decide to exempt the transmission system operator from this obligation.\n(6) Transmission system operators shall provide user-friendly instruments for calculating tariffs.\n(7) Transmission system operators shall keep at the disposal of the relevant national authorities, for at least 5 years, effective records of all capacity contracts and all other relevant information in relation to calculating and providing access to available capacities, in particular individual nominations and interruptions. Transmission system operators must keep documentation of all relevant information under point 3.3(4) and (5) for at least 5 years and make them available to the regulatory authority upon request. Both parties shall respect commercial confidentiality.\u2019"}
