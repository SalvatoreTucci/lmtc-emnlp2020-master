The specific plan for SPAI SpA was subsequently revoked on 11 October 1994.\n(10) The interventions referred to in recitals 6, 7 and 8 are, in terms of objectives and results, essentially the same as the previous interventions under the general restructuring plans approved by the Commission. These interventions are necessary with a view to the completion of the restructuring process in this sector, and failure to approve them would compromise the reorganisation of the sector and jeopardise the economic equilibrium of several thousand smallholdings operating in the different beet production areas.\n(11) The amount of aid granted over the period 1984 to 1992 to the sugar-producing undertakings referred to in recitals 6, 7 and 8 totals EUR 66,9 million, with an annual average impact of approximately 0,5 % of the intervention price for sugar, the effect on competition and intra-Community trade being quite negligible.\n(12) The aid granted concerns nearly all industrial groups operating in the sector, which represents an agricultural area of some 265000 hectares and some 65000 holdings in sugar beet production zones.\n(13) The SPAI SpA is currently in liquidation and the RIBS has made itself a party to the bankruptcy proceedings.\n(14) There are therefore exceptional circumstances which make it possible to classify the aid granted by the Italian Government as compatible with the common market under the conditions provided for by this Decision,", "main_body": ["1.
