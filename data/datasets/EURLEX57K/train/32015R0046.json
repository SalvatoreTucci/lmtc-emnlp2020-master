That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of diclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, for turkeys for fattening and for guinea fowl for fattening and breeding, to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostas\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 21 May 2014\u00a0(2), 22 May 2014\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, diclazuril does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and it is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and guinea fowl for fattening and breeding. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of diclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nDiclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostas\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(6):3728.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(6):3729, EFSA Journal 2014; 12(6):3730.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\n51775 Huvepharma NV.
