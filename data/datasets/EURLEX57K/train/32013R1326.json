Different rates of customs duty were associated with those articles. This led to a complex tariff system of classification.\n(2) In 2012, a single heading 961900 was created in the Harmonised System to cover those sanitary articles. However, the same complex tariff system of classification was kept under the new heading, which was divided into twelve subheadings according to the constituent material, each corresponding to a different conventional rate of duty.\n(3) That complex system has been found to lead to unnecessary difficulties and burdens in the application of the Combined Nomenclature. In the interest of legislative simplification and to avoid unnecessary difficulties in applying the Combined Nomenclature, it is therefore appropriate to simplify both the Combined Nomenclature and the tariff structure for those sanitary articles, in order to implement four categories of products (instead of eight), each of them associated with a single autonomous rate of duty.\n(4) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87\u00a0(1) should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
