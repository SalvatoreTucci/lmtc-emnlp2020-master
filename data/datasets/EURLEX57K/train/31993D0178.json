Member States shall carry out a serological screening of pigs for antibodies to swine vesicular disease virus, in accordance with the requirements of the Annex. The results obtained from the serological screening shall be submitted every  two weeks to the Commission. The screening shall be submitted every two weeks to the Commission. The screening shall be completed by 1 August 1993.\n2. The Commission will analyse the results obtained from the screening for antibodies referred to in paragraph 1 and may amend this Decision in the light of developments.\n3. All Member States shall:\n- arrange that all parts of the transportation network including assembly points, engaged in transport of pigs are undergoing thorough and repeated cleaning and disinfection,\n- arrange in case of outbreaks of swine vesicular disease that the control and eradication measures applied are those laid down in Articles 4, 5 and 10 and points 4, 7 and 8 of Chapter 1, Annex II of Council Directive 92/119/EEC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 March 1993.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 29.\n(2) OJ No L 62, 15. 3. 1993, p. 49.\n(3) OJ No L 50, 2. 3. 1993, p. 29.\n(4) OJ No L 62, 15. 3. 1993, p. 69.\nANNEX\nSerological screening for antibodies to swine vesicular disease virus  I. General screening - All Member States\nMember States shall, during a three month period, carry out a screening programme which is based on testing of samples collected from, at least:\n- 50 % of breeding boars slaughtered, chosen randomly,\n- 5 % of breeding sows slaughtered, chosen randomly,\n- pigs on holdings linked to pigs which have been imported from the Netherlands or Italy, during the period June 1992 to 26 February 1993.\nAs an alternative the Member States may, however, carry out screening of pigs other than the breeding boars and breeding sows referred to above. The screening programme shall be agreed with the Commission as soon as possible.\nII. Screening in three km zones\nWhere not yet done serological screening shall be carried out on pigs kept on all holdings situated within a distance of three km of outbreaks recorded since 1 March 1992 and of pigs kept on holdings, which have been repopulated following outbreaks  since the same date. The results shall be forwarded to the Commission.\nThe screening to be carried out in accordance with Annex IV, points 1 and 2 of Council Directive 80/217/EEC (1).\nIII. Serological tests to be used in a Community surveillance programme\n1. National Laboratories participating in a surveillance programme should use:\neither,\n(a) Serum Neutralization Test (SNT), or\n(b) Liquid Phase Blocking Elisa or Competitive Blocking Elisa or Indirect Trapping Elisa or any Elisa which demonstrates reproducibility and has the ability to score the reference serum positive (doubtful or positiv sera to be confrmed using the SNT).\n2. Laboratories with limited experience of swine vesicular disease tests may send doubtful and positive sera to one of the experienced laboratories, preferably to Pirbright, for confirmation.\n3. A serum with a low positive reaction (2), provided by the Pirbright Laboratory will serve as reference serum, which must score positive in national laboratories.\n4. Laboratories setting up tests should check the sensitivity of their tests regimes using the reference positive serum referred to in paragraph 3 above, distributed by the Pirbright Laboratory together with the protocol of the test as performed in  Pirbright.\n5. Laboratories should use the UK 72 strain virus or equivalent as the test virus.\n(1) OJ No L 47, 21. 2. 1980, p. 11.\n(2) A low positive serum will, when tested in SNT at the Pirbright Laboratory, have a title within the range 1/64-1/128 (final dilution) using the Pirbright protocol, which will be supplied to participating laboratories."}
