Article 9 is amended as follows:\n(a) The following text is added to paragraph 1:\n'Delivery must be made either directly to the place where the tobacco is to be processed or, if authorized by the Member State, to an approved purchase centre. The competent control authority shall approve the delivery centres which must have  appropriate facilities, weighing equipment, instruments for determining moisture content and premises.\nDelivery must be checked by the competent control authority. Checks must include verification that the competent control authority has given prior written authorization for the delivery, of which it must have been given advance written notice to enable  it to identify the date of delivery.\nAfter the check has been carried out, unprocessed tobacco may leave the purchasing centre only for transport to the processing plant. After the checks have been made, the tobacco must be placed in numbered batches of specified weight and moisture  content. Transport of batches to the processing plant must be authorized in writing by the competent control authority which must have received prior notification enabling it to precisely identify the means of transport used, the route, the time of  departure and arrival and the batches of tobacco transported.\nOn arrival of the tobacco at the processing plant, the competent control authority shall verify, in particular by weighing them, that the batches delivered are the same batches checked in the purchasing centres.\nThe competent control authority shall determine the specific conditions it considers necessary for checks on the operations concerned.'\n(b) The following text is added to paragraph 3:\n'If the competent control authority finds that unprocessed tobacco has not been delivered to the places referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 or that, for transfer of the batches of tobacco checked from the purchasing centre to the  processing plant, the transporter does not have a transport authorization as referred to in the fourth sub-paragraph of Article 9 (1), the processing undertaking which has accepted the tobacco in infringement of the rules shall pay the Member State a  sum equal to the premiums payable for the quantity of tobacco concerned. That sum shall be credited to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF).'\n2.
