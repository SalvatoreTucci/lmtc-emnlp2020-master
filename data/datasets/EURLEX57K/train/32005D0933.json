That Decision suspends the importation of birds, other than poultry, from Russia and of unprocessed feathers and unprocessed parts of feathers from those regions of Russia listed in Annex I to that Decision.\n(3) Outbreaks of avian influenza continue to occur in certain parts of Russia and it is therefore necessary to prolong the measures provided for in Decision 2005/693/EC. The Decision can however be reviewed before this date depending on information supplied by the competent veterinary authorities of Russia.\n(4) The outbreaks in the European part of Russia have all occurred in the central area and no outbreaks have occurred in the northern regions. It is therefore no longer necessary to continue the suspension of imports of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers from the latter.\n(5) Decision 2005/693/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/693/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 3 \u201831 December 2005\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 March 2006\u2019.\n2.
