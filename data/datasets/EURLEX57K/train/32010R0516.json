This application is therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) was provisionally authorised for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1458/2005\u00a0(3). It was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005\u00a0(4) and for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1284/2006\u00a0(5).\n(6) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation for laying hens.\n(7) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in the Annex, is authorised without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 June 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0233, 9.9.2005, p.\u00a03.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a057, 3.3.2005, p.\u00a03.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0235, 30.8.2006, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nEC No Additive Chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff\nEnzymes\nE 1621 Endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase Preparation of:\nendo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus\nendo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum\nalpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\nendo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride\nEndo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase: 10\u00a0000\u00a0U\u00a0(1)/g,\nEndo-1,4-beta-glucanase: 120\u00a0000\u00a0U\u00a0(2)/g,\nalpha-amylase: 400\u00a0U\u00a0(3)/g,\nEndo-1,4-beta-xylanase: 210\u00a0000\u00a0U\u00a0(4)/g.\n1.
