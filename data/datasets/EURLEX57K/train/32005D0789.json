These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. Belgium, France and the Netherlands have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant-health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97\u00a0(2).\n(3) The technical information provided for by Belgium, France and the Netherlands has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution, as laid down in particular in Article 23 of Directive 2000/29/EC, have been met. Accordingly, it is appropriate to provide a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure on these programmes.\n(4) The Community financial contribution may cover up to 50\u00a0% of eligible expenditure. However, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 23(5) of the Directive, the rate of the Community financial contribution for the programme presented by Belgium should be reduced, as the programme notified by this Member State has already been the subject of Community funding under Commission Decision 2004/772/EC\u00a0(3).\n(5) In accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2000/29/EC the Commission shall ascertain whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and adopt the measures required by the findings from its verification.\n(6) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999\u00a0(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Financial control of these measures comes under Articles 8 and 9 of the above Regulation, without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 and paragraphs 8 and 9 of Article 23 of the Directive.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The allocation of a Community financial contribution for 2005 to cover expenditure incurred by Belgium, France and the Netherlands relating to necessary measures as specified in Article 23(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC and taken for the purpose of combating the organisms concerned by the eradication programmes listed in the Annex is hereby approved.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total amount of the financial contribution referred to in Article 1 is EUR\u00a0689\u00a0449.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The maximum amounts of the Community financial contribution for each of the programmes shall be as indicated in the Annex.", "The Community financial contribution as set out in the Annex shall be paid on the following conditions:\n(a) evidence of the measures taken has been given in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002;\n(b) a request for payment has been submitted by the Member State concerned to the Commission, in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002.\nThe payment of the financial contribution is without prejudice of the verifications by the Commission in accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2000/29/EC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
