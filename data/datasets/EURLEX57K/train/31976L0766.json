of the European Parliament\u00a0(1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee\u00a0(2),\nWhereas, in several Member States there are laws concerning the determination of the alcoholic strength of a mixture of water and ethanol, and whereas these laws differ from one Member State to another, thus creating obstacles to trade; whereas, Community harmonization in this field and the establishment of a common definition are therefore necessary;\nWhereas, in its resolution of 17 December 1973\u00a0(3) on industrial policy, the Council invited the Commission to forward to it before 1 December 1974 a proposal for a Directive on alcoholometry and alcoholometers;\nWhereas harmonization of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the method for determining alcoholic strength from the results of measurements taken is essential also as a complement to the Directive on the harmonization of alcoholometers and alcohol hydrometers, in order to remove all risk of ambiguity or dispute,", "main_body": ["This Directive defines the method of expressing alcoholic strength, by volume or by mass, as defined in the Annex, and gives a formula to

derived from the alcoholometric tables drawn up on the basis of the formula shown in the Annex, and from measurements taken with alcoholometers or alcohol hydrometers bearing the EEC marks and signs

by volume\u2019 of a mixture of water and ethanol is the ratio of the volume of pure alcohol present in the mixture at 20 oC to the total volume of the mixture at the same temperature.\nThe \u2018alcoholic strength by mass\u2019 of a mixture of water and ethanol is the ratio of the mass of alcohol present in this mixture to the total mass of the mixture.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXPRESSION OF ALCOHOLIC STRENGTH\nThe alcoholic strength is expressed as the parts of alcohol per hundred parts of the mixture.\nThe relevant symbols are:\n\u2018% vol\u2019 for the alcoholic strength by volume,\n\u2018% mas\u2019 for the alcoholic strength by mass.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DETERMINATION OF ALCOHOLIC STRENGTH\nThe procedures to be carried out to determine the alcoholic strength by means of the instruments provided for in the Council Directive of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to alcoholometers and alcohol hydrometers\u00a0(1) shall be as follows:\n\u2014 the reading of an alcoholometer or alcohol hydrometer, at the temperature of the mixture,\n\u2014 the measurement of the temperature of the mixture.\nThe results shall be obtained from the international alcohol tables.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FORMULA FOR THE CALCULATION OF INTERNATIONAL ALCOHOL TABLES FOR MIXTURES OF WATER AND ETHANOL\nThe density \u2018\u03c1\u2019, expressed in kilogrammes per cubic metre (kg/m3), of a mixture of water and ethanol at a temperature (t), expressed in degrees Celsius, is given by the following formula as a function of:\n\u2014 the proportion by mass \u2018p\u2019, expressed as a decimal number\u00a0(2),\n\u2014 the temperature \u2018t\u2019, expressed in degrees Celsius (IPTS-68),\n\u2014 the numerical coefficients given below.\nThis formula is valid for temperatures in the range \u201420 to +40 oC.\n.\nn = 5\nm1 = 11\nm2 = 10\nm3 = 9\nm4 = 4\nm5 = 2\nNUMERICAL COEFFICIENTS IN THE FORMULA\nA\nk B\nk\nk kg/m3\n1 9,982 012 300 \u0387 102
