whereas, therefore, any nematodes discovered in traces of growing media adhering to harvested fresh cultivated mushrooms should normally no longer be pathogenic;\nWhereas, should there be live nematodes present in association with fresh cultivated mushrooms, these mushrooms are intended for marketing for direct human consumption and the presence of such nematodes would therefore, although detrimental to the quality of those mushrooms, not in itself present a risk to the cultivation of mushrooms in Italy;\nWhereas scientific knowledge indicates that the nematodes Aphelenchoides composticola and Ditylenchus myceliophagus have been reported to be present in most mushroom-growing countries in temperate areas; whereas the ubiquity and commonness of the abovementioned nematodes is a consequence of their wide host range among soil funghi; whereas no information is available to indicate that the abovementioned nematodes are not present in Italy too;\nWhereas, although the capacity of Aphelenchoides composticola and Ditylenchus myceliophagus to be potentially damaging to the cultivation of mushrooms and their ubiquity and commonness have been well known for many years, it was not considered appropriate to make specific provisions in relation to them in the Community plant health regime at the time of the adoption of Directive 77/93/EEC; whereas the inclusion of the abovementioned nematodes within the scope of the protective measures against the introduction into the Member States of organisms harmful to plants or plant products has also subsequently not been considered necessary;\nWhereas it can therefore be established that the potential presence of the nematodes concerned in consignments of fresh cultivated mushrooms imported into Italy does not constitute an imminent danger within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Directive 77/93/EEC;\nWhereas Italy should therefore rescind immediately the further measures impeding imports of fresh cultivated mushrooms;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Italy shall immediately rescind the 'Decreto ministeriale 28 ottobre 1987: misure fitosanitarie per l'importazione di funghi coltivati freschi'.", "This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 June 1988.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 26, 31. 1. 1977, p. 20.\n(2) OJ No L 116, 4. 5. 1988, p. 19.\n(3) Gazzetta ufficiale della Repubblica italiana No 124,\n30. 5. 1987, p. 9.\n(4) OJ No L 208, 30. 7. 1987, p. 40."}
