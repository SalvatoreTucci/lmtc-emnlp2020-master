That Regulation provides that those commodities are only to be imported into the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in Part 1 of Annex I thereto.\n(4) Due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in South Africa, Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No\u00a0798/2008 were amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0536/2011\u00a0(6), in order to prescribe specific treatments for imports from South Africa of meat products, treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption obtained from meat of farmed ratites and of biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products consisting of, or containing meat of farmed feathered game, ratites and wild game birds which are sufficient to eliminate animal health risks linked to these commodities and to prohibit imports of breeding and productive ratites and of day-old chicks, hatching eggs and meat of ratites. from the whole territory of South Africa covered by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0798/2008.\n(5) South Africa has submitted information to the Commission on the control measures taken in relation to the recent HPAI outbreaks. The Commission has evaluated that information and the epidemiological situation following those outbreaks in South Africa.\n(6) In addition, the Union\u2019s Veterinary Emergency Team carried out a mission to South Africa to assess the situation and give recommendations to improve disease control.\n(7) South Africa has implemented a stamping-out policy in order to control the disease and limit its spread. South Africa is carrying out surveillance activities for avian influenza which appear to meet the requirements laid down in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0798/2008.\n(8) The positive outcome of the evaluation of the disease situation and the epidemiological investigations carried out by South Africa allow limiting the restrictions on imports of ratite meat into the Union to the disease-affected part of the territory of South Africa, placed under restrictions by South Africa. However, the restrictions on imports of live ratites and their hatching eggs should be maintained for the whole territory of South Africa owing to the higher risk for a possible virus introduction into the Union.\n(9) With respect to the treatments laid down in Decision 2007/777/EC for imports of certain meat products, treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption as well as for biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products, the treatments applied before the occurrence of the HPAI outbreaks should again be applied for those commodities originating from the disease-free part of the territory of South Africa.\n(10) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC lists the territories or parts of territories of third countries to which regionalisation for animal health reasons applies. South Africa\u2019s entry should be amended to take account of the new disease situation as regards HPAI in that third country and the resulting consequences for the restrictions on imports of affected commodities into the Union.\n(11) Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0798/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 74.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 312, 30.11.2007, p. 49.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 226, 23.8.2008, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 2.6.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Decision 2007/777/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Part 1, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018South Africa ZA 01/2005 Whole country\nZA-1 01/2005 The whole country except:\nZA-2 01/2011 The whole country except:\n\u2014 to the North: Swart Berg Mountain range,\n\u2014 to the South: Outeniqua Mountain range,\n\u2014 to the East: R339 road linking the Swartberg Mountain range with the Outeniqua Mountain range, from Barandas through Uniondale,\n\u2014 to the West: Gamka Mountains linking the Swartenberg Mountain range with the Gamka river in a southerly direction towards the Outeniqua Mountains.\u2019\n(2) in Part 2, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA-0 South Africa (1) C C C A D D A C C A A D XXX\nZA-2 South Africa ZA-2 (1) XXX XXX XXX XXX D A XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX D XXX\u2019\n(3) in Part 3, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA South Africa XXX XXX XXX XXX D D A XXX XXX A A D XXX\nSouth Africa ZA-1 E E XXX XXX XXX XXX A E XXX A A XXX XXX\nSouth Africa ZA-2 XXX XXX XXX XXX E E XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX E XXX\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0798/2008, the entry for South Africa is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ZA \u2014 South Africa ZA-0 Whole country SPF\nEP, E       S4\u2019\nBPR I P2 9.4.2011  A\nDOR II\nHER III\nZA-1 Whole country excluding ZA-2 RAT VII   9.10.2011\nZA-2 Part of the territory within the following boundaries:\n\u2014 to the North: Swart Berg Mountain range,\n\u2014 to the South: Outeniqua Mountain range,\n\u2014 to the East: R339 road linking the Swartberg Mountain range with the Outeniqua Mountain range, from Barandas through Uniondale,\n\u2014 to the West: Gamka Mountains linking the Swartenberg Mountain range with the Gamka river in a southerly direction towards the Outeniqua Mountains."}
