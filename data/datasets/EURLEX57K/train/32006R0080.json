In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(6) In view of the significant financial interests at stake, the amount of the security required from the tenderers should be set at a sufficiently high level, with a consequent derogation from Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\n(7) It is also important for the German intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission to maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(8) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The German intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 50\u00a0000 tonnes of rye held by it.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding\n(a) Article 13(1) of that Regulation, tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) Article 5 of that Regulation, the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.", "Notwithstanding the second subparagraph of Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security shall be set at EUR\u00a010 per tonne.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 25 January 2006.\nThe time-limit for submitting tenders under subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be 15.00 (Brussels\u00a0time) each Wednesday thereafter, with the exception of 12 April 2006 and 24 May 2006, there being no invitation to tender in the weeks concerned.\nThe closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial invitation to tender shall be 28 June 2006 at 15.00 (Brussels time).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders must be lodged with the German intervention agency at the following address:\nBundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und Ern\u00e4hrung (BLE),\nDeichmannsaue 29\nD-53179 Bonn\nFax 1 (49)\u00a0228\u00a068\u00a045\u00a039\u00a085\nFax 2 (49)\u00a0228\u00a068\u00a045\u00a032\u00a076.", "The German intervention agency shall send the Commission the tenders received, no later than two hours after expiry of the time-limit for submitting tenders.
