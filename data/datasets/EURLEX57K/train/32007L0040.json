Following the results of the relevant surveys carried out in Denmark, Denmark has submitted information showing that an adequate phytosanitary protection of Denmark against Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr does not require maintaining the status of Denmark as a protected zone against that organism and requested its protected zone status against Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr be withdrawn. Denmark should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(3) From information supplied by the Czech Republic, France and Italy, the Czech Republic, the regions of Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine and Alsace in France and the region of Basilicata in Italy should be recognised as protected zones in respect of Grapevine flavescence dor\u00e9e MLO, because this pathogen is not present there.\n(4) Directive 2001/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 2001/32/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in point (c)(01) \u2018Denmark\u2019 is deleted.\n2. the following point (d)(4) is added:\n\u20184.
