It should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2) Decision ECB/2010/29 of 13 December 2010 on the issue of euro banknotes\u00a0(3) establishes the allocation of euro banknotes in circulation to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the ECB\u2019s capital. Article 4 of Decision ECB/2010/29 and the Annex to that Decision allocates to the ECB 8\u00a0% of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation. The ECB holds intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key, for a value equivalent to the value of euro banknotes that it issues.\n(3) Under Article 2(2) of Decision ECB/2010/23 of 25 November 2010 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro\u00a0(4), the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation are remunerated at the reference rate. Under Article 2(3) of Decision ECB/2010/23, this remuneration is settled by TARGET2 payments.\n(4) Recital 7 to Decision ECB/2010/23 states that the income accruing to the ECB on the remuneration of its intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs related to its share of euro banknotes in circulation should in principle be distributed to the NCBs in accordance with the decisions of the Governing Council, in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key in the same financial year it accrues.\n(5) In the same manner the ECB\u2019s income arising from securities purchased under the securities markets programme (SMP) should in principle be distributed to the NCBs in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key in the same financial year it accrues.\n(6) In distributing the ECB\u2019s income on euro banknotes in circulation and the ECB\u2019s income arising from SMP securities, the ECB should take into account an estimate of its financial result for the year that makes due allowance for the need to allocate funds to a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks, and for the availability of provisions that may be released to offset anticipated expenses.\n(7) In determining the amount of the ECB\u2019s net profit to be transferred to the general reserve fund pursuant to Article 33.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council should consider that any part of that profit which corresponds to income on euro banknotes in circulation and income arising from SMP securities should be distributed to the NCBs in full,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n(a) \u2018NCB\u2019 means the national central bank of a Member State whose currency is the euro;\n(b) \u2018intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation\u2019 means the claims and liabilities arising between an NCB and the ECB and between an NCB and the other NCBs as a result of the application of Article 4 of Decision ECB/2010/29;\n(c) \u2018ECB\u2019s income on euro banknotes in circulation\u2019 means the income accruing to the ECB on the remuneration of its intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs related to its share of euro banknotes in circulation as a result of the application of Article 2 of Decision ECB/2010/23;\n(d) \u2018ECB\u2019s income arising from SMP securities\u2019 means the net income arising from securities purchased by the ECB under the SMP in accordance with Decision ECB/2010/5.", "Interim distribution of the ECB\u2019s income on euro banknotes in circulation and the ECB\u2019s income arising from SMP securities\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ECB\u2019s income on euro banknotes in circulation and the ECB\u2019s income arising from SMP securities shall be due in full to the NCBs in the same financial year it accrues and shall be distributed to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the subscribed capital of the ECB.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ECB shall distribute to the NCBs its income on euro banknotes in circulation accrued each financial year on the second working day of the following year.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ECB shall distribute to the NCBs its income arising from SMP securities earned in each financial year on the last working day in January of the following year.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of the ECB\u2019s income on euro banknotes in circulation may be reduced in accordance with any decision by the Governing Council on the basis of the Statute of the ESCB in respect of expenses incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro banknotes.", "Derogation from Article 2\nIn derogation from Article 2:\n1.
