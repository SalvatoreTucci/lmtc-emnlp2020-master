Data on the physical aspects of European agriculture\nThis is a continuation of the work done in previous years. The aim is to improve the following:\n(a) data on areas, production and use of crops, and particularly the balances;\n(b) data on livestock populations, production and use of animal products, and particularly the meat balances;\n(c) feed balances (either for an initial calculation of the feed balance - often after improvement of the supply balances - or for enhancing the initial calculation on the basis of surveys of resources and uses of agricultural products or more detailed analyses of the data available). We must also seek to establish consistency between the supply balances and the feed balance;\n(d) other work following on from activities already launched with a view to improving figures on stocks or internal use, including use on the farm, and work on establishing technical coefficients.\n2. The environmental aspects of agricultural accounting\nThe main aim is to introduce into the methodology used for the economic accounts for agriculture (EAC) and forestry (EAF) concepts and definitions that enable certain elements that are relevant to the environment to be dealt with - as services in total production or a distribution operation in the form of subsidies or taxes, for example.\nThese new definitions will then be applied.\nThe interest to the Community lies in the production of consistent series to complement the economic accounts for agriculture and forestry.\n3. The agri-environmental indicators\nThe Commission wishes to encourage projects permitting the improvement of the existing indicators such as, in particular, regional-level information on yields of certain crops, data on the sale or consumption of mineral fertilisers etc. It also supports the establishment of landscape indicators such as the lengths of hedges or walls or the areas used at regional level outside the utilised agricultural area (pasture, alpine meadow etc.); the effects of structural characteristics on the operation of holdings; data on cultivation practices.\n4. The use of pesticides\nOther aims of this activity are to continue collecting and processing data on the use of pesticides and to improve quality and speed of transmission by using a variety of methods and sources. Crops must be selected by the Member States on the basis of their importance in terms of areas under cultivation or amounts of pesticides used. Another aim is to obtain information on the use of specific active substances.\n5. Rural development\nThis new departure in agricultural statistics will involve a more detailed territorial breakdown of information normally collected at national level and territorial breakdowns that frequently differ from the breakdowns of administrative regions used for the production of most regional statistics. A wider range of subjects will also be covered, including non-agricultural income of farms and families, particularly from activities that are complementary to agricultural activity and community services provided by farmers, and living conditions in rural regions, agriculture's contribution as a support to other economic and cultural activities, etc.\nTABLE\nTECHNICAL ACTION PLAN 2002\nmaximum Community contribution to costs incurred\nby Member State (EUR 1000)\n>TABLE>"}
