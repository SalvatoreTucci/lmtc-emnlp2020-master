It is therefore necessary to establish maximum concentration limits for these persistent organic pollutants without undue delay in order to ensure a uniform application of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 and to avoid a continuous release of those substances into the environment.\n(5) At its 27th session from 14 to 18 December 2009, the Executive Body of the Protocol decided to add hexachlorobutadiene, polychlorinated naphthalenes, and short-chain chlorinated paraffins to the Protocol.\n(6) At its fifth meeting from 25 to 29 April 2011, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed to add endosulfan to the list of persistent organic pollutants to be eliminated worldwide, with some exemptions.\n(7) In view of the decisions taken by the Executive Body of the Protocol and the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, it is necessary to update Annexes IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 in order to include those substances.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) In order to allow companies and competent authorities sufficient time to adapt to the new requirements, this Regulation should apply from 18 June 2015.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4),",
