Community demand for the products to which that Regulation applies should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose from 1\u00a0January 2008 certain existing tariff quota volumes should be increased or reduced and some new Community tariff quotas should be opened at zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, while avoiding any disturbance of the markets for those products.\n(2) The quota volume for two Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of Community industry for the current quota period ending at 31\u00a0December 2007. Consequently those volumes should be increased with effect from 1\u00a0January 2007.\n(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2008 for certain products on which duties were suspended in 2007. These products should therefore be removed from the table in Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96.\n(4) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96 to be replaced in its entirety.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point\u00a01,3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community.\n(7) Since quota periods start on 1\u00a0January 2008, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96 shall be replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "For the quota period from 1\u00a0January to\u00a031\u00a0December 2007, in Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96:\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2603 is fixed at 6\u00a0500\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2950 is fixed at 12\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes.", "With effect from 1\u00a0January 2008 in Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96:\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2030 is fixed at 1\u00a0500\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2603 is fixed at 6\u00a0500\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2624 is fixed at 600\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2907 is fixed at 2\u00a0500\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2914 is fixed at 5\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number\u00a009.2950 is fixed at 12\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes.", "In Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a02505/96, tariff quotas for order numbers\u00a009.2763, 09.2806, 09.2808, 09.2810, 09.2812, 09.2814, 09.2816 and\u00a009.2818 shall be inserted with effect from 1\u00a0January 2008.", "Tariff quotas for order numbers\u00a009.2610, 09.2612, 09.2625, 09.2627, 09.2809, 09.2882, 09.2904, 09.2919, 09.2920, 09.2979 and\u00a009.2995 shall be closed with effect from 1\u00a0January 2008.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1\u00a0January 2008.\nHowever, Article\u00a02 shall apply from 1\u00a0January 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17\u00a0December 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
