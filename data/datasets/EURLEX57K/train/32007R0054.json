Article 6(7) of the Act of Accession provides that the quantitative restrictions applied by the Community on imports of textile and clothing products are to be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the Community. The quantitative restrictions applicable to imports of certain textile products from third countries into the enlarged Community should consequently be adjusted so as to cover imports into the two new Member States. This necessitates amendments to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries\u00a0(1).\n(2) In order to prevent the enlargement of the Community from having restrictive effects on trade, it is appropriate, when amending the quantities, to use a methodology which takes into account, for the purpose of adjusting the new quota levels, the traditional imports into the new Member States. A formula consisting of the average of the last three years' imports into the two new Member States originating in third countries, provides an adequate measurement of those historical flows. A growth rate has been added. The years 2003 to 2005 have been selected as the most significant, as they represent the latest available information about the two new Member States' imports in textiles and clothing.\n(3) Accordingly, Annexes V and VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be amended to list quota levels applicable from the date of the enlargement, namely 1 January 2007.\n(4) All provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be adapted so as to apply to imports into the new Member States. Consequently, the initials of the new Member States should be inserted in Annex III.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 5, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n3. in Annex III, the second indent of Article 28(6) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 two letters identifying the intended Member State of destination, or group of such Member States, as follows:\nAT = Austria\nBG = Bulgaria\nBL = Benelux\nCY = Cyprus\nCZ = Czech Republic\nDE = Federal Republic of Germany\nDK = Denmark\nEE = Estonia\nGR = Greece\nES = Spain\nFI = Finland\nFR = France\nGB = United Kingdom\nHU = Hungary\nIE = Ireland\nIT = Italy\nLT = Lithuania\nLV = Latvia\nMT = Malta\nPL = Poland\nPT = Portugal\nRO = Romania\nSE = Sweden\nSI = Slovenia\nSK = Slovakia\u2019;\n4.
