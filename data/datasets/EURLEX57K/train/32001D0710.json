The measure is sought on environmental grounds - the benefits in terms of protection of groundwater are known.\n(8) This Decision does not prejudice any future conclusions of the evaluation of MTBE-related risks carried out under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances(2).\n(9) The measure envisaged by Denmark complies with the minimum rates of excise duty referred to in Articles 3 and 4 of Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils(3).\n(10) It is appropriate that the Council should have the opportunity to review this Council Decision, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, no later than 31 December 2004, when the authorisation granted by this Decision expires,", "main_body": ["In accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC, Denmark is hereby authorised to apply a reduction in the rate of excise duty of a maximum of DKK 0,03 per litre on petrol distributed by petrol stations meeting more stringent standards of equipment and operation designed to reduce leakage of MTBE into groundwater.", "The reduced rates of excise duty referred to in Article 1 must comply with the requirements of Directive 92/82/EEC, and in particular the minimum rates laid down in Articles 3 and 4 thereof.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2004.\nBefore that date, the Council may review this Decision on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 September 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
