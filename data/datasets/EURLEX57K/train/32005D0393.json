It also sets out the conditions for exempting certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban).\n(2) Following the evolution of the outbreak or new invasions of bluetongue in the Community from third countries, Decision 2003/828/EC has been amended several times to adapt the demarcation of those zones to new animal health conditions.\n(3) For the sake of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/828/EC and to replace it by this Decision.\n(4) Pursuant to Directive 2000/75/EC, the demarcation of protection and surveillance zones must take account of geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors connected with bluetongue and of the control arrangements. Taking account of those factors and arrangements as well as the information submitted by the Member States, it is appropriate to maintain the zones as set out in Decision 2003/828/EC, except in the case of Greece and Portugal.\n(5) According to the latest scientific information available, movements of vaccinated animals may be considered safe irrespective of the virus circulation at the place of origin or the vectors activity at the place of destination. Therefore, exemptions from the exit ban for domestic movements as set out in Decision 2003/828/EC should be amended to take account of that scientific information.\n(6) Decision 2003/828/EC includes Greece in the global geographical areas where restricted zones are to be established. Greece has submitted a duly substantiated request to the Commission in accordance with Directive 2000/75/EC requesting that Greece be deleted from the list of global geographical areas set out in Decision 2003/828/EC. Accordingly, it is appropriate to delete Greece from that list.\n(7) Portugal has submitted a duly substantiated request to change the demarcation of the restricted zones set out in Decision 2003/828/EC as regards that Member State. Taking into account the geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors connected with bluetongue in the areas concerned in Portugal, the demarcation of those zones should be amended.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe purpose of this Decision is to demarcate the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) shall be established by the Member States as provided for in Article 8(1) of Directive 2000/75/EC.\nThe purpose of this Decision is also to set out the conditions for exempting from the exit ban laid down in Article 9(1)(c) and Article 10(1) of Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban) certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos, from those restricted zones and through those restricted zones (transit).\nThis Decision shall not apply to movements inside the restricted zones referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2, except as provided for in other Articles.", "Demarcation of restricted zones\nRestricted zones shall be demarcated within the global geographical areas listed for zones A, B, C, D and E in Annex I.\nExemptions from the exit ban for those restricted zones shall only take place in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6.\nIn the case of restricted zone E, movements of live animals of ruminant species between Spain and Portugal shall be subject to authorisation by the competent authorities concerned on the base of a bilateral agreement.", "Exemption from the exit ban for domestic movements\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Domestic movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos, from a restricted zone shall be exempted from the exit ban provided that the animals, their sperm, ova and embryos comply with the conditions set out in Annex II or that they comply with paragraphs 2 or 3 of this Article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Domestic movements as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be exempted from the exit ban by the competent authority if:\n(a) the animals originate from a herd vaccinated according to a vaccination programme adopted by the competent authority;\n(b) the animals have been vaccinated more than 30 days but less than 12 months before the date of the movement against the serotype(s) present or possibly present in an epidemiologically relevant area of origin.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where in an epidemiological relevant area of the restricted zones more than 40 days have elapsed from the date when the vector ceased to be active, the competent authority may grant exemptions from the exit ban for domestic movements of the following:\n(a) animals which are destined for holdings registered for this purpose by the competent authority of the holding of destination and which may only be moved from such holdings for direct slaughter;\n(b) animals which are serologically (ELISA or AGID*) negative or serologically positive but virologically (PCR*) negative;
