One outbreak has been reported in wild fish. Another outbreak has been reported in farmed fish where, according to the epidemiological report, the most likely source of infection is wild fish. Consequently, the coastal areas of Sweden no longer meet the requirements for disease-free status for IPN, laid down in Annex I to that Decision. The continental parts of the territory, however, remain disease-free.\n(4) Those two outbreaks should not prevent Sweden from maintaining its IPN programme in its coastal areas and introducing eradication measures if IPN is diagnosed in farmed or wild fish, in accordance with the programme submitted to the Commission before the adoption of Decision 2004/453/EC.\n(5) Decision 2004/453/EC requires targeted surveillance to be maintained in the areas declared free from disease in Member States where only parts of the territory are declared disease-free. When adopted, this requirement did not anticipate the special situation where Ireland and Northern Ireland were declared free from the same disease or diseases, while parts of the United Kingdom were not declared free from those diseases.\n(6) It is appropriate to allow the United Kingdom to discontinue targeted surveillance for certain diseases for which Northern Ireland is declared free, provided Ireland is also declared free from the same diseases.\n(7) Decision 2004/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and V to Decision 2004/453/EC are amended as follows:\n1.
