whereas therefore the quantitative restrictions introduced by this Regulation represent a temporary measure pending the resumption and conclusion of these negotiations;\nWhereas given the economic situation of the Community textile and clothing industry and the development of trade on textiles and clothing products between the Community and the Russian Federation it does not appear to be necessary to reintroduce some of the existing quantitative limits;\nWhereas, as far as the quantitative limits introduced for three months by this Regulation are concerned the amounts foreseen are equivalent to 25 % of those agreed for 1996 increased for an important number of categories by a significant uplift;\nWhereas the importation of products shipped from the Russian Federation before the entry into force of the present Regulation is governed by the provisions of the Agreement in force in 1996 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2315/96 (5);\nWhereas the reduced number of quantitative restrictions in comparison with those existing in the Agreement as well as the increased levels provided for in this Regulation are introduced on the basis that the Russian Federation will not adopt, during the validity of this Regulation, measures in the textiles and clothing sector concerning quantitative restrictions, or increased tariffs or non-tariff barriers such as certification or other import requirements applicable to import of products originating in the Community, other than those measures in force in the Russian Federation at the date of 1 January 1996; whereas the introduction of any such measure will therefore entail a review of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas these measures are in conformity with the opinion expressed by the committee established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["1.
