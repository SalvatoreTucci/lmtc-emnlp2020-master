The reference of that standard was published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 7(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC, first on 14 December 2005\u00a0(3) and again on 8 June 2006\u00a0(4).\n(2) Italy and the Commission have raised formal objections in respect of standard EN 10080:2005.\n(3) The Italian formal objection was lodged on the grounds that EN 10080:2005 does not satisfy the essential requirement of mechanical resistance and stability in Annex I to Directive 89/106/EEC as it does not differentiate clearly the intended use of the reinforcing steels, i.e. the reinforcing steel with specific performance required for use in seismic areas which is an important safety issue of works regulated in Italy.\n(4) The Commission\u2019s formal objection was lodged on the grounds that the Annex ZA to EN 10080:2005 foresees the indication of the performance characteristics according to technical classes, while the standard itself neither defines the technical classes nor the corresponding technical performance characteristics.\n(5) In the light of the results of the examination of the objections raised against the reference of standard EN 10080:2005 \u2018Steel for the reinforcement of concrete \u2014 Weldable reinforcing steel \u2014 General\u2019, the reference of standard EN 10080:2005 should be withdrawn from the list of harmonised standards in the Official Journal of the European Union with the result that compliance with relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standard EN 10080:2005 no longer confers the presumption of fitness for use and of conformity to the relevant provisions of Directive 89/106/EEC,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 10080:2005 \u2018Steel for the reinforcement of concrete \u2014 Weldable reinforcing steel \u2014 General\u2019, is withdrawn from the list of harmonised standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.
