In order to respond to market needs, it is appropriate to make these stocks available on the internal market.\n(3) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.\n(4) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(5) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards the buying in and sale of sugar by intervention agencies\u00a0(3) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender on the Community internal market a total quantity of 1\u00a0370\u00a0636,672 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for sale on the internal market.
