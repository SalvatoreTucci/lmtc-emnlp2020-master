The text of Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 685/69 is amended to read as follows:\n\"2. Such aid may be paid in instalments. No instalment may be paid unless the storer has provided security in an equivalent amount.\nIn no case may the amount of any instalment exceed the amount as calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 due on the date of payment thereof, account being taken of any variation in the aid as a result of the operation of Article 29.\n\"\n2. However, for the storage period as defined in Article 28 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 685/69 ending on 15 September 1975, Member States may provide that the effect of Article 29 of the said Regulation shall not be taken into account in determining the maximum amount of an instalment.\nWhere an instalment paid during the abovementioned storage period exceeds the amount due pursuant to Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 685/69 the excess shall be refunded to the intervention agency by 30 November 1975.\nIn the event that such refund is not made within the time limit stipulated above, the corresponding amount of the security shall be retained and forfeited in satisfaction of the amount due by way of refund.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
