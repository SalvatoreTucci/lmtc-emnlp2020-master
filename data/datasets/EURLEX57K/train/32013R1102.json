This derogation expired on 30 June 2013.\n(2) By letter dated 27 May 2013, Guatemala submitted a request for the extension of the derogation. The request is for the extension until 31 December 2013 with respect to 987,5 tonnes of cooked, frozen and vacuum-packed tuna fillets known as \u2018loins\u2019 (hereafter \u2018tuna loins\u2019) of CN code 1604\u00a014\u00a016. By letters dated 17 and 29 July 2013, Guatemala submitted additional information in support of that request.\n(3) The request demonstrates that the time covered by the said derogation was insufficient for Guatemala to secure adequate flows of originating tuna to the country.\n(4) The extension of the derogation is therefore required in order to give Guatemala sufficient time to prepare its fish processing industry to comply with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin of fish.\n(5) In order to ensure that the temporary derogation is limited to the time needed for Guatemala to achieve compliance with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin of tuna loins, the derogation should be granted from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013.\n(6) In order to ensure the continuity of exports of the fish eligible for preferential tariff treatment from Guatemala to the Union, the derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 July 2013.\n(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1044/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1044/2012 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(2) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1044/2012 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1044/2012 of 8 November 2012 on a derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as regards the rules of origin used for the purposes of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences to take account of the special situation of Guatemala regarding exports of certain fisheries products to the Union (OJ L 310, 9.11.2012, p. 28).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Periods Quantity (in tonnes net weight)\n09.1627 ex\u00a01604\u00a014\u00a016 Cooked, frozen and vacuum-packed tuna fillets known as \u201cloins\u201d 1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012 1\u00a0975 tonnes\n09.1627 ex\u00a01604\u00a014\u00a016 Cooked, frozen and vacuum-packed tuna fillets known as \u201cloins\u201d 1.1.2013 to 30.6.2013 987,5 tonnes\n09.1627 ex\u00a01604\u00a014\u00a016 Cooked, frozen and vacuum-packed tuna fillets known as \u201cloins\u201d 1.7.2013 to 31.12.2013 987,5 tonnes\u2019"}
