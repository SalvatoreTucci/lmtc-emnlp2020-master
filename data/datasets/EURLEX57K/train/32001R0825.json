The situation thus created has affected export opportunities under the conditions laid down by Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to limit these harmful effects by adopting special measures and extending certain time limits laid down in Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000 in respect of export procedures which could not be completed because of the aforementioned circumstances. In particular, the time limit provided for by Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should be extended to enable operators who have already completed the relevant customs export formalities or placed the goods in question under customs control to benefit from the extension of the validity of certificates.\n(6) The benefit of these derogations should be reserved for operators who can prove, in particular on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(14), that they were prevented from carrying out export operations within the specified period by the aformentioned circumstances.\n(7) In view of current developments, the present Regulation should come into force immediately.\n(8) The measures provided for by this Regulation are in conformity with the opinion of the Management Committee for Horizontal Questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not covered by Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["1. The provisions of this Regulation shall apply to the agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, in so far as the exporter concerned can satisfy the competent authorities that he was unable to carry out export operations as a result of measures adopted under Community legislation or of health measures taken by the authorities of the third countries of destination following the confirmation of cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the Community.\nIn making their appraisal, the competent authorities shall rely, in particular, on the commercial documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89.\n2.

On application by the exporter, and by way of derogation from Articles 7(1) and 34(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, the 60-day time limit for leaving the customs territory of the Community shall be extended to 150 days in the case of products for which customs export formalities were completed by 29 March 2001 at the latest.\n4.
