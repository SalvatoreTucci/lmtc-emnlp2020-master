The prohibition on the introduction into the Community of the pelts of the animal species listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 and of the other goods listed in Annex II to that Regulation, shall enter into force on 1  January 1996.\n2. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91, determine before 1 September 1995:\n(a) which countries meet the condition of Article 3 (1) of that Regulation and\n(b) the appropriate forms for certification referred to in Article 4 thereof.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 1994.\nFor the Commission\nYannis PALEOKRASSAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 308, 9. 11. 1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 348, 31. 12. 1982, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 151, 23. 6. 1993, p. 22."}
