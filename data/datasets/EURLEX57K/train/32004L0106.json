These provisions apply in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums. Since the Directive 77/799/EEC will not apply to excise duties, pursuant to this Directive, as from 1 July 2005, it is not appropriate that Member States be required to adopt provisions which are bound to cease to apply within a short time. Therefore, it is necessary to allow Member States not to adopt the provisions necessary to comply with Directive 2004/56/EC concerning excise duties, without prejudice to the obligation to adopt such provisions in respect of other taxes to which Directive 77/799/EC applies.\n(4) Directives 77/799/EEC and 92/12/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 77/799/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the title shall be replaced by the following title:\n2. paragraph 1 of Article 1 shall be replaced by the following:", "Directive 92/12/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
