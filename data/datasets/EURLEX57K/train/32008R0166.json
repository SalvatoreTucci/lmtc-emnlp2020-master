That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the microorganism preparation Bacillus cereus var. toyoi NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012 (Toyocerin) for turkeys for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that microorganism preparation was permanently authorised for piglets under 2 months and sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 256/2002\u00a0(2), piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1453/2004\u00a0(3), cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 255/2005\u00a0(4) and rabbits for fattening and chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(5).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for turkeys for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 19 September 2007 that the microorganism preparation Bacillus cereus var. toyoi NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012 (Toyocerin) does not have an adverse effect on consumers, users or the environment\u00a0(6). According to that opinion, the use of that preparation does not have an adverse effect on this additional animal category and it is efficacious in improving weight gain, feed intake and feed utilisation. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
