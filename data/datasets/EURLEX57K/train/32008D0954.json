As a result of these cases, Sweden informed the Commission on 18 September 2008 on the additional measures that it was taking to prevent the introduction into and spread within its territory of PWN.\n(3) Spain informed the Commission on 12, 14 and 18 November 2008 about cases where susceptible wood and wood products, including wood packaging material, had been moved recently from Portugal to Spain though the requirements laid down in Decision 2006/133/EC were not fulfilled. In some of those cases PWN was detected.\n(4) Portugal has adopted a ministerial decree Portaria n.o 1339-A/2008 on 20 November 2008, including the application of the measures in FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 15 on wood packaging material originating in continental Portugal and destined for intra-Community trade or export.\n(5) In view of this information, it is necessary that all susceptible wood, originating in the demarcated areas in the form of packing cases, boxes, crates, drums and similar packings, pallets, box pallets and other load boards, pallet collars, dunnage, spacers and bearers, including that which has not kept its natural round surface, is treated and marked before it is moved out of the demarcated area, instead of only the newly produced material.\n(6) This information also indicates that the existing requirements for movements of all types of susceptible wood other than those referred to in recital 5 and originating in the demarcated areas are not fully applied. Under those circumstances it is appropriate to introduce a general prohibition for movements of such wood out of the demarcated areas. Exceptions from the general prohibition should be provided for as regards movements of susceptible wood from authorised processing plants. Those plants should be authorised and inspected by the responsible official body to ensure that an effective treatment is carried out. They should be included in a list established and updated by the Commission. Traceability should be guaranteed by a plant passport or by a mark as set out in the applicable FAO Standard.\n(7) Member States should have the possibility to take measures to ascertain whether the susceptible wood, bark or plants, moving from demarcated areas into their territory is free from PWN.\n(8) Decision 2006/133/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The text of Article 3 to Decision 2006/133/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 3\nMember States of destination other than Portugal may:\n(a) subject consignments of susceptible wood, bark and plants, coming from Portugal and moved into their territory, to testing for the presence of PWN;\n(b) take further appropriate steps to carry out official monitoring in respect of such consignments and to ascertain whether they comply with the relevant conditions specified in the Annex.
