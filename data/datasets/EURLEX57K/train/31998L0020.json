whereas the relevant provisions of the said Directive should therefore be clarified to that effect;\n(6) Whereas an exemption granted for an aeroplane from a developing nation should benefit only that nation;\n(7) Whereas it is necessary to clarify the scope for exemptions granted on economic grounds;\n(8) Whereas it should be made clear that a Member State can only establish a timetable for the gradual withdrawal of non-compliant aeroplanes in respect of aeroplanes which are on the register of that Member State;\n(9) Whereas some Member States have agreements with third country carriers allowing them an exemption for phasing out Chapter 2 aeroplanes similar to that granted to Community air carriers; whereas it is appropriate that these agreements should not be revoked;\n(10) Whereas it is essential that the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC be kept up to date and amended in a timely manner; whereas, therefore, amendments should be drawn up by the Commission assisted by a committee of a regulatory nature;\n(11) Whereas Article 3 of Directive 92/14/EEC provides for exemptions for aeroplanes on the registers of developing nations and whereas the aeroplanes so exempted were listed in the Annex to that Directive;\n(12) Whereas it is necessary to amend the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC so as to add certain aeroplanes which qualify for an exemption and were not included when that Directive was adopted; whereas it is also necessary to delete all mention of certain aeroplanes that have been withdrawn from service, destroyed or otherwise no longer qualify for the exemption;\n(13) Whereas it is essential to prevent wrong usage of registrations; whereas the Annex to this Directive contains, for each aeroplane, reference to the manufacturers' serial number for the individual aeroplane;\n(14) Whereas it is important to ensure that infringements of Community law are penalised under conditions which make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive;\n(15) Whereas under the 1994 Act of Accession Austria has to comply with the provisions of Directive 92/14/EEC as from 1 April 2002,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDirective 92/14/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following paragraph shall be added to Article 1:\n\u201cair carrier\u201d means an air transport undertaking with a valid operating licence;\n\u201coperating licence\u201d means an authorisation granted to an undertaking permitting it to carry out carriage by air of passengers, mail and/or cargo for remuneration and/or hire;\n\u201cCommunity air carrier\u201d means an air carrier with a valid operating licence granted by a Member State in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers\u00a0(6)\n\u201ctotal civil subsonic jet fleet\u201d means the total aircraft fleet of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes at the disposal of the air carrier, through ownership or any form of lease agreement of not less than one year.\n2. the following paragraph shall be added to Article 2:\n3.
