The European Union expressed its willingness to continue to provide financial assistance up to 2006 as an extension of the pre-accession aid planned under the Phare programme in support of Slovakia\u2019s decommissioning efforts.\n(2) Protocol No 9 on Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant in Slovakia, as annexed to the 2003 Act of Accession, reiterates Slovakia\u2019s commitment to close the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant and, to this end, establishes an assistance programme with a budget of EUR 90 million for the period 2004 to 2006.\n(3) In Protocol No 9 the Union also recognised that decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant will have to continue beyond the Financial Perspectives 2002 to 2006 and that this effort represents a significant financial burden for Slovakia. Decisions on the continuation of assistance from the Union in this field after 2006 will take account of this situation.\n(4) International decommissioning funds managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have been in place for a number of years. Through the Phare programme in particular, the Community is the main contributor to these funds.\n(5) Consequently, provision should be made for a sum of EUR 423 million\u00a0(4) from the general budget of the European Union to fund the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant over the period from 2007 to 2013.\n(6) The appropriations of the general budget of the European Union for decommissioning should not lead to distortions of competition in relation to power supply companies on the energy market in the Union. These appropriations should also be used to finance measures to compensate the loss of production capacity in line with the acquis.\n(7) The financial assistance may be made available as a Community contribution to the Bohunice International Decommissioning Support Fund managed by the EBRD.\n(8) The tasks of the EBRD include managing the public funds allocated to the programmes for decommissioning nuclear power plants and monitoring the financial management of these programmes so as to optimise the use of public money. In addition, the EBRD carries out the budget tasks entrusted to it by the Commission in line with the requirements of Article 53(7) of the Financial Regulation.\n(9) Protocol No 9 leaves open the possibility of the establishment of different implementation routes for assistance to meet the purpose mentioned in Article 2, including a nationally administered accredited channel. The Commission and Slovakia could develop the implementing modalities in line with the relevant sections of the Financial Regulation.\n(10) In order to ensure the highest possible efficiency, the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant should be carried out with recourse to the best available technical expertise, and with due regard to the nature and technological specifications of the units to be shut down.\n(11) The decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant should be carried out in line with the legislation on the environment, particularly Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment\u00a0(5).\n(12) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of Point 38 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management\u00a0(6), is inserted in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority as defined by the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(13) For the adoption of measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation the Commission should be assisted by a committee,", "main_body": ["This Regulation establishes the programme laying down detailed rules for implementation of the Community\u2019s financial contribution provided for in Protocol No 9 annexed to the 2003 Act of Accession.", "The Community contribution to the programme under this Regulation shall be granted for the purpose of providing financial support for measures connected with the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant, measures for environmental upgrading in line with the acquis and for modernising conventional production capacity to replace the production capacity of the two reactors at the Bohunice V1 power plant and other measures which stem from the decision to close and decommission this plant and which contribute to the necessary restructuring, upgrading of the environment and modernisation of the energy production, transmission and distribution sectors in Slovakia as well as to enhancing security of supply and energy efficiency in Slovakia.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial reference amount necessary for implementation of the programme provided for in Article 2 for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 shall be EUR 423 million\u00a0(7).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budget authority within the limits of the financial framework.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of the appropriations allocated to the programme may be reviewed in the course of the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 to take account of the progress made with implementation of the programme and ensure that the programming and allocation of the resources are based on actual payment needs and absorption capacity.", "The contribution for certain measures may amount to up to 100\u00a0% of the total expenditure.
