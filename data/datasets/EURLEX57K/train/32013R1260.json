Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, the territorial units should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification.\n(4) In accordance with the second paragraph of Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission is to submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every three years on the progress made towards achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion. Annual regional data at NUTS 3 regional level is necessary for the preparation of those reports and for the regular monitoring of demographic developments and of possible future demographic challenges in the Union regions, including different types of regions such as border regions, metropolitan regions, rural regions and mountain and island regions. Since demographic ageing exhibits strong regional differences, Eurostat is required to prepare regional projections on a regular basis in order to complement the demographic picture of the NUTS 2 regions in the Union.\n(5) In accordance with Article 159 TFEU, the Commission is to draw up a report each year on progress in achieving the objectives of Article 151 TFEU, including the demographic situation in the Union.\n(6) The Commission in its Communication of 20 October 2009 entitled \u2018Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities in the EU\u2019 supported the further development and collection of data, and the further development of health indicators, by age, sex, socioeconomic status and geographic dimensions.\n(7) The Sustainable Development Strategy of the Union, launched by the European Council in Gothenburg in 2001 and renewed in June 2006, has as its objective the continuous improvement of the quality of life for current and future generations. The Commission (Eurostat) monitoring report, which is published every two years, provides an objective statistical picture of progress, based on a Union set of sustainable development indicators.\n(8) Annual demographic statistics are fundamental for the study and definition of a wide range of policies, with particular regard to social and economic issues, at national and regional level. Statistics on population are an important denominator for a wide range of policy indicators.\n(9) The strategic objective H.3. of Chapter IV of the Beijing Platform for Action (1995) provides a reference framework for the generation and dissemination of gender-disaggregated data and information for planning and policy evaluation reasons.\n(10) Demographic statistics constitute an essential component for the estimation of total population in the framework of the European System of Accounts. It is important to update and revise data when establishing statistics at European level.\n(11) In order to ensure the quality, and in particular the comparability, of the data provided by the Member States, and in order for reliable overviews to be drawn up at Union level, the data used should be based on the same concepts, and should refer to the same reference date or period.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) provides a reference framework for European demographic statistics. In particular, it requires compliance with the principles of professional independence, impartiality, objectivity, reliability, statistical confidentiality and cost effectiveness.\n(13) The information on demography should be consistent with the relevant information collected pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) and Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5). To this end, scientifically-based and well-documented statistical estimation methods should be evaluated, and their use should be encouraged.\n(14) When developing, producing and disseminating European statistics, the national and European statistical authorities, and, where applicable, other relevant national and regional authorities, should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, as reviewed and updated by the European Statistical System Committee on 28 September 2011.\n(15) This Regulation guarantees the right to respect for private and family life and to the protection of personal data, as set out in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(16) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(7) apply with regard to the processing of personal data in the context of this Regulation.\n(17) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of European demographic statistics in the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(18) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(8),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics on population and vital events.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(a) \u2018national\u2019 refers to the territory of a Member State within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 applicable at the reference time;\n(b) \u2018regional\u2019 means NUTS level 1, NUTS level 2 or NUTS level 3 within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 applicable at the reference time; where this term is used in connection with countries that are not members of the Union, \u2018regional\u2019 means the statistical regions at level 1, 2 or 3, as agreed between those countries and the Commission (Eurostat), at the reference time;\n(c) \u2018usually resident population\u2019 means all persons having their usual residence in a Member State at the reference time;\n(d) \u2018usual residence\u2019 means the place where a person normally spends the daily period of rest, regardless of temporary absences for purposes of recreation, holidays, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage.
