These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. They have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in the Directive and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant-health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97\u00a0(2) (hereinafter \u2018the Regulation\u2019).\n(3) The expenditure which Belgium and Portugal have incurred, and which is taken into account in this Decision, relates directly to the matters specified in Article 23(2)(a) and (b) of the Directive.\n(4) The technical information provided for by Belgium and Portugal has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively; the information has also been considered by the Standing Committee on Plant Health.

An extension of the period in which eradication measures have to take place, as foreseen in the third subparagraph of Article 23(5) of the Directive, has been granted to this existing programme, as the examination of the situation has lead to the conclusion that the objective of these eradication measures is likely to be achieved within a reasonable period. The Community financial contribution for this programme, has been progressively reduced in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 23(5).\n(8) The contribution referred to in Article 2 of this Decision is without prejudice to further actions taken or to be taken and necessary for the achievement of the objective of eradication or control of the relevant harmful organisms.\n(9) The present Decision is without prejudice to the outcome of the verification by the Commission under Article 24 of the Directive on whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and the consequences of such verification.\n(10) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999\u00a0(6), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.
