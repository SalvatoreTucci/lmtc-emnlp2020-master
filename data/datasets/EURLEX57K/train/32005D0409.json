That programme has been assessed by the Commission, and found to provide the necessary guarantees for export of live molluscs for further growth, fattening or relaying into the Community.\n(6) Croatia is not authorised for export of live molluscs for human consumption, pursuant to Commission Decision 97/20/EC of 17 December 1996 establishing the list of third countries fulfilling the equivalence conditions for the production and placing on the market of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods\u00a0(4). Accordingly, imports of such mollusc from that country should not be authorised under Decision 2003/804/EC.\n(7) It is also appropriate to simplify the table in Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC.\n(8) Therefore Decision 2003/804/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 1.
