Subject to the provisions laid down in Council Directive 69/208/EEC (5) and to the conditions outlined in paragraph 2, the authorities of the United Kingdom shall consent to the placing on the market of the following product, notified by Plant Genetic Systems (Reference C/UK/94/M1/1), under Article 13 of Directive 90/220/EEC.\nThe product comprises of living seeds of a hybrid swede-rape (Brassica napus L. oleifera Metzq.) derived using:\n(a) the progeny of the male sterile swede-rape line MS1Bn (B91-4) cultivar Drakkar containing the barnase gene from bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease, the bar gene from streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from nicotiana tabacum; and\n(b) the progeny of the fertility restoration swede-rape line RF1BN (B93-101) cultivar drakkar containing the barstar gene from bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease inhibitor, the bar gene from streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from nicotiana tabacum.\n2. The conditions of the consent are as follows:\n(a) The consent covers the seeds of all hybrids between non-genetically modified swede-rape and the genetically modified swede-rape described in paragraph 1 but does not cover the seeds of any hybrids resulting from a combination of any genetically modified plants other than those described in paragraph 1.\n(b) The consent only covers the notified use of the product for growing for obtaining seed, but does not extend to the use for human food or animal feed, without prejudice to any future assessment of the product for such use.\n(c) In addition to any other labelling, it will be indicated on the label of each package of seeds that the product is tolerant to the herbicide glufosinateammonium; and that the product is to be used only for obtaining seed and not for human food or animal feed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 1996.\nFor the Commission\nRitt BJERREGAARD\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 117, 8. 5. 1990, p. 15.\n(2) OJ No L 103, 22. 4. 1994, p. 20.\n(3) OJ No L 230, 19. 8. 1991, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 227, 1. 9. 1994, p. 31.\n(5) OJ No L 169, 10. 7. 1969, p. 3."}
