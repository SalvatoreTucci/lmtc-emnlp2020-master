Given the lack of experience of Bulgaria and Romania in implementing the Leader approach and\u00a0in order to build sufficient local capacity to apply Leader, the average financial contribution of 2,5\u00a0% for the Leader axis should be applied for the period 2010 to\u00a02013 for those countries.\n(4) With a view to allowing Bulgaria and Romania to benefit until\u00a02013 from the transitional measures concerning the support to semi-subsistence agricultural holdings and the setting-up of producer groups, Bulgaria and Romania should be added to the list of countries benefiting from these measures.\n(5) Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01698/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a01698/2005 shall be amended as follows:\n1. the following subparagraph shall be added to Article\u00a017(2):\n2. the introductory words in Article\u00a020(d) shall be replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1\u00a0January\u00a02007 subject to the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 19\u00a0June\u00a02006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
