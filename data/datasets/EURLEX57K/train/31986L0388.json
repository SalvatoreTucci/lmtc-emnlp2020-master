whereas it has not yet been possible to identify the foodstuffs or ingredients most likely to be affected by this migration; whereas, furthermore, it appears that sources other than regenerated cellulose packaging, which have not yet been identified with any certainty, contribute to the presence of these two softeners in foodstuffs;\nWhereas, in the light of these observations, the possibility of a risk to human health cannot be ruled out;\nWhereas, however, a total and immediate prohibition of the two substances as envisaged by the Federal Republic of Germany would be a measure disproportionate to the possible risk; whereas, as a preventive measure, it is more appropriate to establish a maximum amount of such substances in foodstuffs in contact with regenerated cellulose film;\nWhereas this amount must be calculated on the basis of toxicological data and be consistent with the principle of the inertia of materials embodied in the second indent of Article 2 of Directive 76/893/EEC;\nWhereas this restriction should be regarded as a temporary measure until such time as the research on migration of these two substances to different types of foodstuffs has been completed;\nWhereas, in any case, it can be concluded that use of the two substances in regenerated cellulose film does not constitute any immediate danger to human health; whereas, therefore, provision can be made for a deadline for implementation of the preventive measure contained in this Directive which will allow stocks of both packages and foodstuffs that have already been packaged to be run down;\nWhereas the Member States should be left to determine the deadline for implementation in the light of both the levels of contamination observed and the dietary habits of their consumers in relation to those levels; whereas, however, a maximum deadline of 31 March 1987 is in any case adequate;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["In the First Part of Annex II, heading B.1, the text opposite the first two indents, in the column entitled 'Restrictions' in Directive 83/229/EEC is replaced by the following:\n'Only for films intended to be glazed and then used for foodstuffs which are not moist, i.e. which do not contain water which is physically free at the surface.\nThe total amount of bis (2-hydroxyethyl) ether and ethanediol present in a foodstuff in contact with films of this type may not exceed 50 mg/kg of the foodstuff'.", "Member States shall amend their laws, regulations and administrative provisions in order to apply the limit laid down in Article 1 as from 1 April 1987 at the latest.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 1986.\nFor the Commission\nCOCKFIELD\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 340, 9. 12. 1976, p. 19.\n(2) OJ No L 123, 11. 5. 1983, p. 31."}
