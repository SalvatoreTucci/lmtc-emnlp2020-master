Despite the adoption of a high number of scientific opinions per year, the Panel faces difficulties in managing its workload.\n(3) It is expected that the number of mandates received by the Panel will increase in the future with the adoption of new vertical legislation in the area of vitamins and minerals added to foods and on food additives, flavourings, and food enzymes.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to replace that Panel by two new Panels named respectively \u2018the Panel on food additives and nutrient sources added to food\u2019 and \u2018the Panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids\u2019.\n(5) The division of responsibilities between the two new Panels should aim at ensuring that the expertise of each Panel corresponds to their respective field of competence and contributes to a better balance of the work. The procedures governing the EFSA Scientific Committee and Panels should guarantee flexible coordination and harmonised methods.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 the first subparagraph is amended as follows:\n1. point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) the Panel on food additives and nutrient sources added to food;\u2019\n2. the following new point (j) is added:\n\u2018(j) the Panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings, and processing aids\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.
