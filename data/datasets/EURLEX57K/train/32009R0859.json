This would result in banning those lamps from the internal market from 1 September 2009.\n(2) The phasing out of G9 and R7s cap lamps is considered only in a longer term, as they are widely used and there is presently no suitable replacement available that would fit into the luminaires designed for such lamps. Recital 21 of Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 states that the requirements of the measure allow halogen lamps of socket G9 and R7s to remain on the market for a limited period of time. There is no indication in the Regulation of the length of this time period, however it was not the intention to ban these lamps on 1 September 2009 on the basis of UVC radiation, in case they comply with the other requirements of the Regulation.\n(3) Article 15 of Directive 2005/32/EC requires that the ecodesign requirements should not affect functionality from the user\u2019s perspective, should not entail excessive costs, should not have a significant negative impact on industry\u2019s competitiveness, and should be established taking into account relevant Community legislation.\n(4) It is important to ensure that lamps placed on the EU market are safe for use. Directive 2006/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits\u00a0(3) (Low Voltage Directive) regulates the radiation of electrical equipment designed for use with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1\u00a0000\u00a0V for alternating current and between 75 and 1\u00a0500\u00a0V for direct current. UV radiation limits are set in related harmonised standards for both mains voltage and extra low voltage (such as 12\u00a0V and 24\u00a0V) tungsten halogen lamps, but not for compact fluorescent lamps. More fundamentally, Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety\u00a0(4) requires that products placed on the market are safe.\n(5) It is necessary to ensure coherence between Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 and other Community legislation affecting the UV radiation of non-directional household lamps. Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2005/32/EC,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 244/2009\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the first day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndris PIEBALGS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0191, 22.7.2005, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a076, 24.3.2009, p.\u00a03.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0374, 27.12.2006, p.\u00a010.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a011, 15.1.2002, p.\u00a04.\nANNEX\nEcodesign requirements for non-directional household lamps\nTable 5 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\nTable 5\nFunctionality requirements for lamps excluding compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps\nFunctionality parameter Stage 1 Stage 5\nRated lamp lifetime \u2265\u00a01\u00a0000\u00a0h \u2265\u00a02\u00a0000\u00a0h\nLumen maintenance \u2265\u00a085\u00a0% at 75\u00a0% of rated average lifetime \u2265\u00a085\u00a0% at 75\u00a0% of rated average lifetime\nNumber of switching cycles \u2265 four times the rated lamp life expressed in hours \u2265 four times the rated lamp life expressed in hours\nStarting time <\u00a00,2\u00a0s <\u00a00,2\u00a0s\nLamp warm-up time to 60\u00a0%\u00a0\u03a6 \u2264\u00a01,0\u00a0s \u2264\u00a01,0\u00a0s\nPremature failure rate \u2264\u00a05,0\u00a0% at 100\u00a0h \u2264\u00a05,0\u00a0% at 200\u00a0h\nLamp power factor \u2265\u00a00,95 \u2265\u00a00,95\u2019"}
