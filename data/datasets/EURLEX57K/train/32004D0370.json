An examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for using the new formulae are fulfilled.\n(4) Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 lays down that Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation defined in the same Article where commercial practice or technical requirements warrant such a derogation.\n(5) In the United Kingdom commercial practice does not require that the tongue is removed from the pig carcase; this should be taken into account in adjusting the weight for standard presentation.\n(6) In accordance with Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 and by way of derogation from Article 2(1) and (2) thereof, the weight of the cold carcase may be calculated by reference to pre-determined scales of absolute weight reductions if the reductions for individual weight classes correspond, as far as possible, to the reductions calculated in percentage terms; the United Kingdom has notified the determination of such a scale to the Commission.\n(7) No modification of the apparata or grading methods may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained; for this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.\n(8) For the sake of clarity, a new Decision should be adopted and Decision 88/234/EEC should therefore be repealed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is hereby authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in the United Kingdom, excluding Northern Ireland:\n- the apparatus termed \"Intrascope (Optical Probe)\" and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of Annex I,\n- the apparatus termed \"Fat-O-Meater (FOM)\" and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of Annex 1,\n- the apparatus termed \"Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\" and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of Annex I,\n- the apparatus termed \"CSB Ultra-Meater\" and the assessment method related thereto, details of which are given in Part 4 of Annex I,\n- the apparatus termed \"Fully automatic ultrasonic carcass grading\" (Autofom) and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 5 of Annex I.\nAs regards the apparatus \"CSB Ultra-Meater\" it is laid down that after the end of the measurement procedure it must be possible to verify on the carcase that the apparatus measured the values of measurement x1 and x2 on the site provided for in Annex I, Part 4, point 3.
