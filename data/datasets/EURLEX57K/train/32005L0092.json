It is nonetheless important to prevent a growing divergence in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States from leading to structural imbalances within the Community and distortions of competition in some sectors of activity.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to maintain the minimum standard rate at 15\u00a0% for a further period long enough to cover the ongoing implementation of the strategy to simplify and modernise current Community legislation on VAT.\n(4) Directive 77/388/EEC should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The first and second subparagraphs of Article 12(3)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018The standard rate of value added tax shall be fixed by each Member State as a percentage of the taxable amount and shall be the same for the supply of goods and for the supply of services.
