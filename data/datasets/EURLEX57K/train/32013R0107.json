Cans with the same coating are used for the canning of food and in accordance with the European Food Safety Authority\u2019s (EFSA) a scientific opinion on melamine in food and feed\u00a0(2), a specific migration limit (SML) of 2,5\u00a0mg/kg for the canned food as such has been established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 of 14 January 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food\u00a0(3) as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1282/2011\u00a0(4).\n(3) The Codex Alimentarius Commission has established maximum levels for melamine in feed and food\u00a0(5) which are to apply to feed as sold, while the maximum levels established in Directive 2002/32/EC concern feed with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%.\n(4) Recently provided information has demonstrated that melamine can migrate in wet pet food from the can coating at a level above 2,5\u00a0mg/kg relative to a feed with a moisture content of 12\u00a0% but below the SML of 2,5\u00a0mg/kg in the wet pet food. In the light of this development in scientific and technical knowledge, it is appropriate to establish the maximum level of 2,5\u00a0mg/kg for melamine for canned wet pet food on a \u2018as sold\u2019 basis and this in line with what is foreseen for canned food.\n(5) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 140, 30.5.2002, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) and EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF); Scientific Opinion on Melamine in Food and Feed.
