This Regulation contains those measures.\n(4) The appropriate measures should be incorporated in Regulation (EC) No\u00a06/2002 through the inclusion of a new title on \u2018International registration of designs\u2019.\n(5) The rules and procedures relating to international registrations designating the Community should, in principle, be the same as the rules and procedures which apply to Community designs applications. According to this principle, an international registration designating the Community should be subject to the examination as to the grounds for non-registrability before it takes the same effect as a registered Community design. Likewise, an international registration having the same effect as a registered Community design should be subject to the same rules on invalidation as a registered Community design.\n(6) Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a06/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The accession of the Community to the Geneva Act will create a new source of revenues for the Office for the Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and\u00a0Designs).
