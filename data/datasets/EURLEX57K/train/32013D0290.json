The necessary adaptations are not provided for in the Act of Accession for Croatia\u00a0(4) and thus need to be adopted before accession with this Decision so as to be applicable as from accession.\n(3) The process of enlargement will result in significant modification of the land border of the new Union with neighbouring third countries, with the extension of the coastal border to include more sea coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and with the addition of one international airport.\n(4) The proposed locations put forward as border inspection posts with third countries in Croatia have been the subject of audits by the Commission audit service (formerly referred to as Commission inspection service), the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO). It is considered that these locations will be completed to Union requirements by accession. Therefore the proposed locations in Croatia should be added to the list of approved border inspection posts in Member States set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(5) At the same time as a result of the accession of Croatia, certain Member States notably Hungary and Slovenia will cease to have borders with third countries. As a result certain land border inspection posts in these Member States will become redundant. Therefore the list of approved border inspection posts in these two Member States set out in Annex I to Decision 2009/821/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) Furthermore, the process of enlargement will result in the addition of local veterinary units in Croatia for the use of Traces. Therefore these local veterinary units must be added to the list of local units in Traces for Member States, laid down in Annex II to Decision 2009/821/EC.\n(7) Decision 2009/821/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "The amendments set out in the Annex shall enter into force subject to, and as from the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Croatia.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 12.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 112, 24.4.2012, p. 21.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 2009/821/EC are amended as follows:\n(1) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(a) in the part after France, the following part for Croatia has to be added:\nBajakovo HR VUK 3 R  HC (2), NHC(2)\nKarasovi\u0107i HR KRS 3 R  HC (2), NHC(2)\nNova Sela HR MET 3 R  HC(2), NHC(2) E, O\nPlo\u010de HR PLE 1 P  HC, NHC\nRijeka HR RJK 1 P  HC, NHC\nStara Gradi\u0161ka HR SGS 3 R  HC, NHC U, E, O\nZagreb HR ZAG 4 A  HC (2), NHC(2) O\u2019\n(b) in the part concerning Hungary, the entries for the rail at Gy\u00e9k\u00e9nyes and for the road at Letenye are deleted;\n(c) in the part concerning Slovenia, the entries for the rail at Dobova, for the road at Gru\u0161kovje, Jel\u0161ane and Obre\u017eje are deleted;\n(2) in Annex II in the part after France, the following part for Croatia has to be added:\nHR00001 BJELOVAR\nHR00007 GRAD ZAGREB\nHR00002 OSIJEK\nHR00003 RIJEKA\nHR00009 \u0160IBENIK\nHR00008 SLAVONSKI BROD\nHR00004 SPLIT\nHR00005 VARA\u017dDIN\nHR00006 ZAGREB\u2019"}
