In order to respond to market needs, it is appropriate to open a standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available for export.\n(3) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans.\n(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a maximum export refund for each partial invitation to tender.\n(5) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 42(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, the price to be paid by the successful tenderer should be determined by the invitation to tender.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to determine the period of validity of the export licences.\n(8) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States to the Commission on the quantities actually sold and exported.\n(9) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards the buying-in and sale of sugar by intervention agencies\u00a0(3) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar pursuant to this Regulation.\n(10) The quantities available for a Member State that can be awarded when the Commission fixes the maximum export refund should take into account the quantities awarded pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1039/2006 of 7 July 2006 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden\u00a0(4).\n(11) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden shall offer for sale by standing invitation to tender for export to all destinations excluding Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro a total quantity of 852\u00a0681 tonnes of sugar accepted into intervention and available for export.
