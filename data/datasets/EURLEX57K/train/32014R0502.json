Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides for an adjustment of direct payments for reasons of financial discipline. Provision should be made to ensure an optimal application of those reductions in 2014.\n(2) In the interest of transparency and predictability, it is appropriate that the method of calculation of both reductions in the process of calculating the amount of the payments to be made to farmers in respect of 2014 corresponds to the method for calculating the linear reduction of direct payments due to the application of Article\u00a08(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and the reduction due to financial discipline under Article 11 of that Regulation as provided for in Article 79(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009\u00a0(4) and under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 635/2013\u00a0(5).\n(3) Article 29(5) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, as amended by point (1) of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01310/2013, provides for the possibility for Member States to pay, from 16 October 2014, advances to farmers in respect of applications made in 2014. To ensure consistency with the rules applicable in 2013 in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 946/2013\u00a0(6) providing that advances may be paid without taking into account the adjustment due to financial discipline under Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, it is appropriate to foresee that, also in 2014, advances may be paid without taking into account the reductions due to financial discipline provided for in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013\u00a0(7) and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013.
