Therefore the spatial data services need to be further documented with additional metadata. To a lesser degree, it also concerns the harmonisation of the content of the service contrary to the spatial data sets implementing rules.\n(3) For the development of the implementing rules mandated by Directive 2007/2/EC the emphasis was first put on the core services, i.e., the network services, with Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009\u00a0(3), and on the interoperability of the spatial data sets, in Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010. Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 should therefore now be amended to contain the implementing rules for the spatial data services.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 22 of Directive 2007/2/EC,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Article 2 the following points 31 to 38 are added:\n\u201831. \u201cend point\u201d means the internet address used to directly call an operation provided by a spatial data service,\n32. \u201caccess point\u201d means an internet address containing a detailed description of a spatial data service, including a list of end points to allow its execution,\n33. \u201cInvocable spatial data service\u201d means all of the following:\n(a) a spatial data service with metadata which fulfils the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008\u00a0(5),\n(b) a spatial data service with at least one resource locator that is an access point,\n(c) a spatial data service in conformity with a documented and publicly available set of technical specifications providing the information necessary for its execution,\n34. \u201cinteroperable spatial data service\u201d means an invocable spatial data service which fulfils the requirements of Annex VI,\n35. \u201charmonised spatial data service\u201d means an interoperable spatial data service which fulfils the requirements of Annex VII,\n36. \u201cconformant spatial data set\u201d means a spatial data set which fulfils the requirements of this Regulation,\n37. \u201coperation\u201d means an action supported by a spatial data service,\n38. \u201cinterface\u201d means the named set of operations that characterise the behaviour of an entity as defined by ISO 19119:2005.\n(3) Article 6 is amended as follows:\n(a) the title is replaced by the following:\n(b) in paragraph 1, the introductory sentence is replaced by the following:\n(4) in Article 8, the following paragraph 3 is added:\n(5) after Article 14, the following Articles are inserted:\n(6) Annex V, as set out in the Annex I to this Regulation, is added;\n(7) Annex VI, as set out in the Annex II to this Regulation, is added;\n(8) Annex VII, as set out in the Annex III to this Regulation, is added.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 25.4.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services (OJ L\u00a0323, 8.12.2010, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 of 19 October 2009 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the Network Services (OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 of 19 October 2009 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the Network Services (OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9).\u2019\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 of 3 December 2008 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata (OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12)\u2019\nANNEX I\n\u2018ANNEX V\nIMPLEMENTING RULES FOR INVOCABLE SPATIAL DATA SERVICES\nPART A\nWriting Conventions\nSimilar to the Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008, the following writing conventions are used for the spatial data service metadata.\nWhere specified in the description of the metadata elements, the value domains shall be used with the multiplicity expressed in the relevant tables.
