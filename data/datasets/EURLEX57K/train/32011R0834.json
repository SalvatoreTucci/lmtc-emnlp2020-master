The addition of guazatine to Annex\u00a0I was suspended due to a new application for inclusion in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC submitted pursuant to Article\u00a013 of Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a033/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(6). This new application has been withdrawn by the applicant with the effect that the reason for suspending the addition to Annex\u00a0I disappeared. Therefore, the substance guazatine should be added to the lists of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008.\n(5) The substance 1,3-dichloropropene has not been included as an active substance in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC, with the effect that 1,3-dichloropropene is banned for pesticide use and thus should be added to the lists of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008. The addition of 1,3-dichloropropene to Part\u00a02 of Annex\u00a0I was suspended due to a new application for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC submitted pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008. This new application resulted again in the decision not to include the substance 1,3-dichloropropene as an active substance in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 91/414/EEC with the effect that 1,3-dichloropropene remains banned for pesticide use and that the reason for suspending the addition to Part 2 of Annex\u00a0I disappeared. Therefore, the substance 1,3-dichloropropene should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008.\n(6) The substance haloxyfop-P has been included as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, with the effect that haloxyfop-P is no longer banned for pesticide use. Consequently the active substance, as referred to as haloxyfop-R, should be deleted from Part\u00a01 of Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008.\n(7) Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) In order to allow enough time for Member States and industry to take the measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation, its application should be deferred.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article\u00a0133 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01907/2006,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 31.7.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, p. 27.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 18.1.2008, p. 5.\nANNEX\nAnnex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0689/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Part\u00a01 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following entries are added:\nChemical CAS No Einecs No CN code Subcategory (*) Use limitation (**) Countries for which no notification is required\n\u2018Ethalfluralin + 55283-68-6 259-564-3 2921\u00a043\u00a000 p(1) b\nGuazatine + 108173-90-6 236-855-3 3808\u00a099\u00a090 p(1)-p(2) b-b\nIndolylacetic acid + 87-51-4 201-748-2 2933\u00a099\u00a080 p(1) b\nThiobencarb + 28249-77-6 248-924-5 2930\u00a020\u00a000 p(1) b\u2019\n(b) the following entry is deleted:\nChemical CAS No Einecs No CN code Subcategory (*) Use limitation (**) Countries for which no notification is required\n\u2018Haloxyfop-R + 95977-29-0 n.a. 2933\u00a039\u00a099 p(1) b\u2019\n(2) in Part\u00a02 the following entries are added:\nChemical CAS RN Einecs No CN code Category (*) Use limitation (**)\n\u20181,3-dichloropropene 542-75-6 208-826-5 2903\u00a029\u00a000 p b\nEthalfluralin 55283-68-6 259-564-3 2921\u00a043\u00a000 p b\nGuazatine 108173-90-6 236-855-3 3808\u00a099\u00a090 p b\nIndolylacetic acid 87-51-4 201-748-2 2933\u00a099\u00a080 p b\nThiobencarb 28249-77-6 248-924-5 2930\u00a020\u00a000 p b\u2019"}
