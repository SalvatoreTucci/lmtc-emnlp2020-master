This has called for major installation work which could not be completed in time. This situation makes it impossible for distillers to meet the delivery date for the alcohol, i.e. 30 November 2001. That date should therefore be extended by one month and this amendment made to apply from 1 December 2001.\n(2) Under Article 62(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2047/2001(4), the date in question concerns by-products.
