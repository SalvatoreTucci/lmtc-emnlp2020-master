Pursuant to Article 19(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, where the applicable ex ante conditionalities are not fulfilled, the programme shall contain a description of the action to be taken, including the measures to be financed,\n\u2014 implementation of data validation systems as provided for in Article 109 of the Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009, and in particular projects aiming at establishing interoperability between Member States' respective systems, as a complete and reliable catch and effort reporting system is a cornerstone in the management of the Union fisheries resources,\n\u2014 enforcement and control of the obligation to land all catches as provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5). This new obligation is a very important addition to the new Common Fishery Policy made in order to contribute to the sustainability of the exploitation of fisheries stocks. The implementation of this new obligation will create adaptations in Member States' control system which will include new expenditures,\n\u2014 enforcement and control of the catch certification scheme for the importation and exportation of fishery products as provided for in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008; The implementation of the catch certification scheme is the cornerstone of the fight against the IUU activity,\n\u2014 effective actions aiming at enforcing fleet capacity limitations. In order to ensure the balance between the fishing opportunities and the fishing capacity, the Member States have to ensure the respect of the capacity limitation and they should implement projects aiming at certification, verification and measurement of engine power requiring funding,\n\u2014 implementation of the Specific Control and Inspection Programmes (SCIPs) or of control coordination in relation to a fishery or an area not covered by a SCIP, pursuant to Article 95(4) of the Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009 and Article 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005\u00a0(6). These types of action contribute to the development of the culture of compliance, the reinforcement of the cooperation between the Member States and create synergy between the different control tools,\n\u2014 enforcement and control of traceability requirements as set out in Article 58 of the Regulation (EC) No\u00a01224/2009 and Article 67(6) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011\u00a0(7). Article 58 of the Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 requires that all lots of fisheries and aquaculture products be traceable at all stages of production, processing and distribution, from catching or harvesting to retail stage. Article\u00a067(6) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 requires operators to affix the information on fisheries and aquaculture products referred to in Article 58(5) of the Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 by way of an identification tool such as a code, barcode, electronic chip or a similar device or marking system; that requirement applies from 1 January 2013, to products from fisheries subject to a multiannual plan, and as from 1\u00a0January 2015, to other fisheries and aquaculture products. Enforcement and control of traceability requirements should be a Union priority. The implementation of the traceability system is the cornerstone of the control fisheries policy in order to ensure the transparency of the origin of the fisheries products.\n(4) The Union priorities should be applied in a flexible manner depending upon the strengths and weaknesses of the enforcement and control policy in each Member State. If a Member State has already addressed certain priorities, that Member State should in principle address other priorities.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 20(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the priorities of the Union for enforcement and control policy may be amended every two years by the way of implementing acts in order to adapt them to the evolving needs of control,\n(6) In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Decision, this Decision should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["The priorities of the Union for enforcement and control policy, as referred to in Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0508/2014, shall be the following:\n(a)
