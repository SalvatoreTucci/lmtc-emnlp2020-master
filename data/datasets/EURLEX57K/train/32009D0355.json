Particular attention should be given to the collection of data regarding the levels of lycopene in breakfast cereals. However, this requirement under the present Decision, applies to the use of lycopene as a novel food ingredient and not to the use of lycopene as a food colour, that falls within the scope of Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption\u00a0(2).\n(7) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes, hereinafter called the product, as specified in Annex I, may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient to be used in the foods listed in Annex II.", "The designation of the novel food ingredient authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes\u2019.", "The company LycoRed shall establish a monitoring programme accompanying the marketing of the product.
