Therefore, plants of Vitis L., other than fruits, originating in Switzerland should be allowed to enter the Community.\n(4) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, the introduction into the areas within the Community recognised as protected zones as regards Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. of the host plants, other than fruit and seeds, of this harmful organism, originating in third countries other than those recognised as being free from this harmful organism, or in which pest free areas have been established in relation to this harmful organism, is prohibited.\n(5) From information supplied by Switzerland, it appears that the measures Switzerland applies as regards the introduction into and movement within its territory of host plants of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al., other than fruits and seeds, are largely equivalent to the measures laid down in Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore, host plants of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al., other than fruits and seeds, and other than plants of Cotoneaster Ehrh. and Photinia davidiana (Dcne.) Cardot, originating in Switzerland should be allowed to enter the Community.\n(6) From information supplied by Italy based on surveys, it appears that some areas in Italy should not longer be recognised as \"protected zones\" in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al.\n(7) Due to a clerical error in the preparation of Directive 2003/116/EC, current point 21.1 of Part B of Annex IV to Directive 2000/29/EC was erroneously numbered.\n(8) The current provisions against Tilletia indica Mitra should be amended to take into account the updated information on the presence of this harmful organism in Iran.\n(9) Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II, III, IV and V to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
