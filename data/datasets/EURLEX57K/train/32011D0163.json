Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and animal products covered by that Directive are subject to the submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances listed in that Annex. Those plans are to be updated at the request of the Commission, particularly when certain checks render it necessary.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\u00a0(2) approves the plans provided for in Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC (the plans) submitted by certain third countries listed in the Annex thereto for the animals and animal products indicated in that list.\n(3) In the light of the recent plans submitted by certain third countries and additional information obtained by the Commission, it is necessary to update the list of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import certain animals and animal products, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC and currently listed in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC (the list).\n(4) The United Arab Emirates has submitted a plan for camel milk to the Commission. That plan provides sufficient guarantees and should be approved. Therefore, camel milk should be included in the entry for the United Arab Emirates in the list.\n(5) Brunei has submitted a plan for aquaculture to the Commission. That plan provides sufficient guarantees and should be approved. Therefore, Brunei should be included in the list as regards aquaculture.\n(6) The Commission requested that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provide information on the implementation of its plan for equidae for slaughter. In the absence of a reply from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia there are not sufficient guarantees for approval. The entry for that third country concerning equidae for slaughter should therefore be deleted from the list. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been informed accordingly.\n(7) The entry for Malaysia in the list includes poultry but the plan provided by Malaysia and the additional information obtained by the Commission do not provide sufficient guarantees in respect of poultry. However, the only establishment processing such raw material currently approved in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(3) imports all its raw material from a Member State. In order to permit the continuation of that activity, the entry for Malaysia should include poultry but it should be restricted to raw material imported from other third countries included in the list for such material or from Member States. Malaysia has been informed accordingly. A footnote setting out this limitation should be included in the list for that third country.\n(8) The Commission requested that Russia provide information on the implementation of its plan for equidae for slaughter. In the absence of a reply from Russia there are not sufficient guarantees for approval. The entry for that third country concerning equidae for slaughter should be deleted from the list. Russia has been informed accordingly.\n(9) The Commission requested that Ukraine provide information on the implementation of its plan for equine animals and products. In the absence of a reply from Ukraine there are not sufficient guarantees for approval. The entry for that third country concerning equine animals and products should be deleted from the list. Ukraine has been informed accordingly.\n(10) The United States has been asked to provide information on the implementation of its plan for equine animals and products. However, the United States did not provide the respective guarantees as the slaughter of equidae for export to the Union has ceased in that third country. The entry for that that third country concerning equine animals and products should therefore be deleted from the list. The United States has been informed accordingly.\n(11) A Commission inspection to Uruguay has revealed serious shortcomings concerning the implementation of the plan for rabbit and farmed game. For rabbit, there was no residue monitoring plan in place and for farmed game, no sampling or testing was possible because of a cessation in production. The entries for Uruguay concerning rabbit and farmed game should therefore be deleted from the list. Uruguay has been informed accordingly.\n(12) Certain third countries export animal products derived from raw material originating from Member States or from other third countries that comply with the provisions of Directive 96/23/EC for such materials and which are therefore included in the list. In order to ensure that animal products imported into the Union are covered by an approved plan, third countries that import such raw material for subsequent export to the Union should include a statement in their plan to that effect.\n(13) In order to avoid any disruption to trade, a transitional period should be laid down to cover the relevant consignments from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Russia, Ukraine and Uruguay, which were dispatched to the Union before the date of application of this Decision.\n(14) Decision 2004/432/EC has been amended several times. In the interests of clarity of Union legislation, it should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The plans provided for in Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC submitted to the Commission by the third countries listed in the
