General\n1.1. Fund assistance will be concentrated on operations to further employment in:\n1.1.1. the absolute priority regions as defined in Article 7 (3) of Council Decision 83/516/EEC;\n1.1.2. areas of industrial and sectoral restructuring made up of zones assisted or proposed by the Commission to be assisted from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund or assisted under Article 56 of the ECSC Treaty (see attached list);\n1.1.3. areas of high and long-term unemployment drawn up by reference to unemployment rates and gross domestic product (see attached list).\n1.2. Priority operations limited to the absolute priority regions are indicated by the letters 'AR'; those limited to these regions and the regions listed in the Appendix are marked 'R'; priority operations without regional limitation are marked 'N'.\n1.3. Persons unemployed for more than 12 months are considered to be long-term unemployed.\n1.4. Priority will be given to vocational training operations which:\n1.4.1. equip trainees with the skills required for one or more specific types of job;\n1.4.2. have a minimum duration of 200 hours apart from whatever preparatory training which may be included;\n1.4.3. include 40 hours devoted to training broadly related to new technologies, which are counted in the calculation of the minimum duration of training; this will not apply to operations for the mentally disabled;\n1.4.4. in the case of operations intended to further employment in Greece and Portugal, and in Spain for 1987, the minimum duration laid down in 1.4.2 shall be reduced to 100 hours and the requirement related to new technologies in 1.4.3 shall not apply.\n1.5. Priority will be given to theoretical instruction forming part of apprenticeship training only in the absolute priority regions or elsewhere where it concerns the disabled and the members of the families of migrant workers.\n1.6. Priority will not be given to assist the salary costs of public agents in the case of operations for instructors, vocational guidance or placement experts or development agents.\n1.7. Applications will be approved by budget item. Where appropriations are insufficient to cover priority operations, a linear reduction will be applied, calculated in proportion to the financial volume of remaining applications by each Member State. This system will also apply to a surplus of non-priority operations. In the application of the reduction, preference will be given to:\n1.7.1. operations forming part of an integrated programme involving assistance from two or more Community financial instruments, in particular Integrated Mediterranean Programmes (N);\n1.7.2. operations of vocational training leading directly to specific jobs in enterprises employing less than 500 persons and linked with the application of new technology which is the subject of Community Programmes of Research and Development (N);\n1.7.3. operations particularly dependent on Fund assistance for their implementation (N).\n1.8. Decisions on applications for assistance will be consistent with Community policies and will take account of compliance with Community rules.\n1.9. When implementing the Guidelines, the Commission shall have regard to the adjustment problems of Spain and Portugal, especially as far as national legislation is concerned; in particular, it shall take account of the economic and social situation of Portugal. 2. Priority operations for young people under 25\n2.1. Vocational training for persons under 18 years of at least 800 hours duration including work experrience of at least 200 hours but not exceeding 400 hours and offering substantial prospects of employment (R); for operations intended to further employment in Greece and Portugal, and in Spain for 1987, the minmum work experience required shall be 100 hours.\n2.2. Vocational training for persons whose qualifications have through experence proved to be inadequate or inappropriate preparing them for skilled jobs requiring the use of new technology (N) or in occupations offering substantial prospects of employment (AR). The requirement for new technology shall not apply in 1987 for Spain.\n2.3. Recruitment to or setting up of additional jobs of indeterminate duration (R) or to additional jobs of at least six month duration which fulfil a public need (AR).\n2.4. Vocational training, recruitment to or setting up of additional jobs through employment initiatives taken by local groups, with the assistance, as appropriate, of local or regional authorities, and in the context of a local expansion of employment opportunities (N).\n3. Priority operations for persons over 25\n3.1. Vocational training of the long-term unemployed geared to their needs and including motivation and guidance and offering substantial prospects of employment (R).\n3.2.

Recruitment or setting up of the long-term unemployed to additional jobs of indeterminate duration or to additional jobs of at least six months duration which fulfil a public need (AR).\n3.4.

Vocational training linked to operations to restructure industrial undertakings because of technological modernization or fundamental changes in demand in the sector concerned; the restructuring must substantially affect the skills requirements and affect at least 15 % of the workforce within a period of two years. The training may relate to workers being retrained for continued employment in the undertaking, or those becoming redundant and needing jobs elsewhere (R). Priority will be given outside the priority regions where the restructuring affects the skills requirements of at least 25 % of the workforce and is located in an area of particularly high unemployment or where the public authorities have introduced exceptional measures to support vocational training or job creation (N).\n4.4. Operations of vocational training leading directly to specific jobs in enterprises employing less than 500 persons and linked with the application of new technology which is the subject of Community Programmes of Research and Development (N).\n4.5. Recruitment to additional full-time or part-time jobs linked to the reorganization or redistribution of work, as agreed between the social partners (N).\n4.6. Vocational training, recruitment to or setting up of additional jobs for women in occupations in which they are under-represented (N).\n4.7.
