Therefore, dinotefuran should be considered as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 10(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 for the purpose of authorising products in accordance with Article 23 of that Regulation.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to approve dinotefuran for use in biocidal products for product-type 18 subject to compliance with certain specifications and conditions.\n(8) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials in accordance with Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(9) Since the conditions of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 are met, the provisions of that Regulation should apply. Dinotefuran should be approved for a period not exceeding 7 years in accordance with Article 10(4) of that Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Dinotefuran shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 18, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0167, 27.6.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L\u00a0396, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nDinotefuran IUPAC Name: 991 g/kg 1 June 2015 31 May 2022 18 Dinotefuran is considered a candidate for substitution in accordance with Article 10(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The purity indicated in this column was the minimum degree of purity of the active substance used for the evaluation made in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
