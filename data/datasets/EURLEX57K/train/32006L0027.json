EC type-approval procedure laid down by Directive 2002/24/EC.\n(2) It is necessary to introduce the last amendment to United Nations ECE Regulation No 78 into the European type approval requirements in order to maintain equivalence between the requirements laid down in Directive 93/14/EEC and those laid down in United Nations ECE Regulation No 78.\n(3) The requirements on statutory markings and maximum speed for two- and three-wheel motor vehicles as laid down in Directives 93/34/EEC and 95/1/EC can be simplified for reasons of better regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure the proper functioning of the type-approval system as a whole, it is necessary to clarify which provisions concerning external projections, safety belt anchorages and safety belts shall apply to bodied vehicles and to unbodied vehicles.\n(5) In Directive 97/24/EC, the requirements for marking of original catalytic converters and original silencers need to be clarified and completed.\n(6) Directives 93/14/EEC, 93/34/EEC, 95/1/EC and 97/24/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to

Brake linings shall not contain asbestos.\u2019;\n(2) Appendix 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) Sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 are replaced by the following:\n\u20181.1.1. The performance prescribed for braking devices shall be based on the stopping distance and/or the mean fully developed deceleration. The performance of a braking device shall be determined by measuring the stopping distance in relation to the initial speed of the vehicle and/or measuring the mean fully developed deceleration during the test.\n1.1.2. The stopping distance shall be the distance covered by the vehicle from the moment when the driver begins to actuate the control of the braking system until the moment when the vehicle stops; the initial vehicle speed, v1, shall be the speed at the moment when the driver begins to actuate the control of the braking system; the initial speed shall not be less than 98\u00a0% of the prescribed speed for the test in question. The mean fully developed deceleration, (dm), shall be calculated as the deceleration averaged with respect to distance over the interval vb to ve according to the following formula:\ndm = means fully developed deceleration\nv1 = as defined above\nvb = vehicle speed at 0,8 v1 in km/h\nve = vehicle speed at 0,1 v1 in km/h\nsb = distance travelled between v1 and vb in metres\nse = distance travelled between v1 and ve in metres\n(b) In Section 1.1.3, the word \u2018component\u2019 is replaced by \u2018vehicle\u2019;\n(c) Section 1.2.1.1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.2.1.1.

The second part consists of six characters (letters or digits) for the purpose of describing the general characteristics of the vehicle (type, variant, and in the case of mopeds, version); each characteristic may be represented by several characters. If its manufacturer does not use one or more of those characters the unused spaces must be filled by alphabetical or numerical characters, the choice being left to the manufacturer;\u2019.\nANNEX III\nAnnex I to Directive 95/1/EC is amended as follows:\nSection 7 is replaced by the following:\n\u20187.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MAXIMUM SPEED\nThe maximum speed of the vehicle is expressed in kilometres per hour by the figure corresponding to the closest whole number to the arithmetical mean of the values for the speeds measured during the two consecutive tests, which must not diverge by more than 3\u00a0%. When this arithmetical mean lies exactly between two whole numbers it is rounded up to the next highest number. In the case of vehicles where the maximum speed is not limited by the relevant definition given in Article 1, sections 2 and 3 of Directive 2002/24/EC, no type-approval test is needed and the maximum speed shall be accepted as being that declared by the vehicle manufacturer in the information document given in Annex II to Directive 2002/24/EC.\u2019.\nANNEX IV\nDirective 97/24/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) In section II.1 of Appendix 2 to Annex III to Chapter 1, the fifth indent is deleted.\n(2) Chapter 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) Annex I is amended as follows:\n(i) The title is replaced by the following:\n(ii) The following section 3.6 is added:\n\u20183.6.
