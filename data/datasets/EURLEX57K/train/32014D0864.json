Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.\n(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.\n(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.\n(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC\u00a0(3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n(5) Following the notification by Germany of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in a turkey fattening holding in the commune of Heinrichswalde, in the district of Vorpommern-Greifswald in the Land Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, on 5 November 2014, Commission Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU\u00a0(4) was adopted.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU provides that the protection and surveillance zones established by Germany, in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC, are to comprise at least the areas listed as protection and surveillance zones in the Annex to that Implementing Decision. Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU is to apply until 22 December 2014.\n(7) The interim protective measures put in place following the outbreak in Germany have now been reviewed within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed.\n(8) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to define the protection and surveillance zones established in Germany at Union level in collaboration with that Member State and to fix the duration of that regionalisation. In addition, the boundaries of the areas listed in the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU need to be amended slightly in order to enlarge the surveillance zone and to take better account of certain administrative boundaries in that Member State.\n(9) For the sake of clarity, Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU should be repealed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Germany shall ensure that the protection and surveillance zones established in accordance with Article 16(1) of Directive 2005/94/EC comprise at least the areas listed as protection and surveillance zones in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.", "Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2014.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (OJ L\u00a010, 14.1.2006, p.\u00a016).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2014/778/EU of 6 November 2014 concerning certain interim protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in Germany (OJ L\u00a0325, 8.11.2014, p.\u00a026).\nANNEX\nPART A\nProtection zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name Date until applicable in accordance with Article 29 of Directive 2005/94/EC\nDE Germany Postal code Area comprising: 1.12.2014\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania\n17379 Municipality of Heinrichswalde\n17335 Town of Strasburg including the part Neuensund\n17379 Municipality of Wilhelmsburg including the part M\u00fchlenhof\n17379 An area of the municipality of Rothem\u00fchl with an approximate width of 1\u00a0800\u00a0m along the Northern, Western and Southern borders of that municipality\nPART B\nSurveillance zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name Date until applicable in accordance with Article 31 of Directive 2005/94/EC\nDE Germany Postal Area comprising: 10.12.2014\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania\n17099 Municipality of Galenbeck\n17337 Municipality of Sch\u00f6nhausen\n17098 Municipality of Friedland including the area of the Heinrichswalder Forest\n17349 Municipality of Sch\u00f6nbeck including the area of the Ratteyer Forest\n17349 Municipality of Voigtsdorf including the area of the gravel quarry\n17379 Municipality of Wilhelmsburg including the parts:\n\u2014 Eichhof\n\u2014 Eichhof settlement\n\u2014 Fleethof\n\u2014 Friedrichshagen\n\u2014 Gr\u00fcnhof\n\u2014 Johannesberg\n\u2014 Mariawerth\n\u2014 Mittagsberg\n\u2014 Wilhelmsburg\n17335 Town of Strasburg including the parts Gehren and Schwarzensee with the areas Rosenthal und Klepelshagen\n\u2014 Burgwall\n\u2014 Wilhelmslust\n\u2014 Ziegelhausen\n\u2014 Schwarzensee settlement\n\u2014 Sch\u00f6nburg\n\u2014 Marienfelde\n\u2014 Karlsfelde\n17379 Municipality of Altwigshagen, including the parts Altwigshagen and Demnitz\n17309 Municipality of Jatznick including the parts:\n\u2014 Klein Luckow\n\u2014 Waldesh\u00f6he\n\u2014 Gro\u00df Spiegelberg\n17379 Ferdinandshof including the part Ferdinandshof\n17358 Town of Torgelow including the part Heinrichsruh\n17337 Municipality of Gro\u00df Luckow\n17379 Municipality of Rothem\u00fchl\nBrandenburg\n17337 Municipality of Uckerland including the parts Hansfelde and Wismar.
