OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar is an emerging disease with many uncertainties and the surveillance programmes approved by this Decision have not yet been fully evaluated. Therefore, the period of time that Member States can put in place specific restrictions related to this disease should be prolonged for another year.\n(4) Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 3a(2) of Decision 2010/221/EU, the date \u201830 April 2013\u2019 is replaced by \u201830 April 2014\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 May 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 24.11.2006, p. 14.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 98, 20.4.2010, p. 7."}
