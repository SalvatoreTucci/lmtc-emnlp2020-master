The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) has amended the conditions of use of certain oenological practices already authorised in the European Union. In order to meet the international standards in this field and to provide EU producers with the same possibilities available to third-country producers, the conditions of use of these oenological practices should be amended in the EU in accordance with the conditions of use defined by the OIV.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 authorises the use of polyvinylimidazole/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVI/PVP) copolymers in order to reduce the copper, iron and heavy metal content, provided that they comply with the requirements of the International Oenological Codex published by the OIV, especially as regards the maximum monomer content. As the OIV has not yet adopted such requirements, and for the sake of legal clarity, this practice should be deleted from Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 authorises the use of chitosan and chitin-glucan of fungoid origin. At present in the EU, these products are only prepared from the Aspergillus niger mushroom. As the OIV authorises these products and the International Oenological Codex published by the OIV specifies that they derive from the Aspergillus niger mushroom, this information should be included in Regulation (EC) No 606/2009.\n(4) Wines entitled to the protected designation of origin \u2018Douro\u2019 and the protected geographical indication \u2018Duriense\u2019 followed by the statement \u2018colheita tardia\u2019 derogate from the maximum sulphur dioxide content. Portugal has requested that all Portuguese wines that have the same characteristics as these wines and are entitled to a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication followed by the statement \u2018colheita tardia\u2019 be granted this derogation. A maximum sulphur dioxide content of 400 milligrams per litre should be authorised for these wines.\n(5) As the traditional specific term \u2018vino generoso\u2019 no longer applies solely to liqueur wines, the provision on the use of this term referred to in point 8 of Part B of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 should be adapted.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee established by Article 195(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 is amended as follows:\n(a) Annex I A is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation;\n(b) Annex I B is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation;\n(c) Annex III is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 193, 24.7.2009, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nAnnex I A to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1) the table is amended as follows:\n(a) the tenth and eleventh indents in the first column of row 10 are replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 chitosan derived from Aspergillus niger,\n\u2014 chitin-glucan derived from Aspergillus niger.\u2019;\n(b) the third column of row 31 is replaced by the following:\n(c) row 41 is deleted;\n(d) the first column of row 44 is replaced by the following:\n(e) the first column of row 45 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Appendix 6 is replaced by the following:\n(a) microbiological stabilisation of bottled wine containing fermentable sugar;\n(b) preventing the development of undesirable yeasts and lactic bacteria;\n(c) blocking the fermentation of sweet, semi-sweet and semi-dry wine.\n\u2014 for (a), the addition must be carried out only a short time prior to bottling,\n\u2014 the product used must comply with the purity criteria laid down in Directive 2008/84/EC,\n\u2014 this treatment is to be recorded in the register referred to in Article 185c(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\u2019;\n(3) Appendix 11 is deleted;\n(4) the first indent of point 1 in the \u2018Requirements\u2019 part of Appendix 12 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 The wine can first of all be cooled.\u2019\n(5) the title of Appendix 13 is replaced by the following:\nANNEX II\nThe ninth indent of point 2(e) of Part A of Annex I B to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 wines from Portugal entitled to a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication and to the statement \u201ccolheita tardia\u201d,\u2019\nANNEX III\nThe introductory sentence of the first paragraph of point 8 of Part B of Annex III is replaced by the following:\n\u2018In the case of liqueur wines, the specific traditional name \u201cvino generoso\u201d shall be used only for dry liqueur wines with a protected designation of origin developed totally or partly under flor and:\u2019."}
