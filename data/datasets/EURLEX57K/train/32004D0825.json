Romania\n(notified under document number C(2004) 4440)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2004/825/EC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae\u00a0(2) provides, inter alia, for the definition of categories of equidae and identification requirements.\n(2) The Commission adopted Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species, and amending Decisions 93/195/EEC and 94/63/EC\u00a0(3).\n(3) In accordance with the aforementioned list, Member States authorise importation of all categories of equidae from Romania under the conditions laid down for countries assigned to the sanitary group \u2018B\u2019 in Decisions 92/260/EC\u00a0(4), 93/195/EEC\u00a0(5), 93/196/EEC\u00a0(6) and 93/197/EEC\u00a0(7) respectively for the temporary admission of registered horses, for the re-entry after temporary export of registered horses, for imports of equidae for slaughter and for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production.\n(4) Decision 93/197/EEC requires for imports of equidae from certain countries assigned to the sanitary Group \u2018B\u2019 that the health tests be carried out in laboratories approved by the Member State of destination.\n(5) Commission Decision 94/467/EC of 13 July 1994 lays down health guarantees for the transport of equidae from one third country to another in accordance with Article 9(1)(c) of Directive 91/496/EEC\u00a0(8).\n(6) Commission Decision 2000/68/EC of 22 December 1999 amending Commission Decision 93/623/EEC and establishing the identification of equidae for breeding and production\u00a0(9) requires equidae to be accompanied during their movement, and in particular during transport to the slaughterhouse, by an identification document.\n(7) A series of follow-up missions of the Food and Veterinary Office carried out in Romania and the controls carried out by Member States at approved border inspection posts repeatedly revealed shortcomings with regard to the conditions under which equidae from Romania are prepared for export to the Member States and transported to destination which were not remedied according to the recommendations made in those reports.\n(8) It is therefore necessary to reinforce the measures adopted to safeguard the health of Community equidae population and to ensure the animal welfare of equidae on the territory of Member States by adopting protective measures laying down a specific regime for imports of equidae for slaughter and imports of equidae for breeding and production which originate in Romania and reinforcing control measures.\n(9) The endorsement by the central competent authority in Romania of the issued certificates should reinforce the assurances given in particular pursuant to Article 12(2)(d) of Directive 90/426/EEC.\n(10) Improved identification of equidae and testing in laboratories approved by the Member State of destination of equidae imported from Romania into the Community should also contribute to the sound enforcement of the import regime.\n(11) In order to follow up the situation and with a view to withdrawing the measures, it is necessary to receive regularly information on the findings of checks carried out at approved border inspection posts or during a period of residence in the Member State of destination.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body":
