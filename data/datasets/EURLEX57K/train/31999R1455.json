DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to sweet peppers of varieties (cultivars) grown from Capsicum annuum L. to be supplied fresh to the consumer, sweet peppers for industrial processing being excluded.\nAccording to their shape a distinction is made for four commercial types:\n- elongated sweet peppers (pointed),\n- square sweet peppers (blunt),\n- square tapering sweet peppers (peg top),\n- flat sweet peppers (tomato peppers).\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements for sweet peppers after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the sweet peppers must be:\n- intact,\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n- fresh in appearance,\n- practically free from pests,\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n- well-developed,\n- free of damage caused by frost,\n- free of unhealed injuries,\n- free of sunburn [except for the specifications in Chapter B: Classification, point (ii)],\n- with peduncles attached,\n- free of abnormal external moisture,\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\nThe development and condition of the sweet peppers must be such as to enable them to:\n- withstand transport and handling, and\n- arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nSweet peppers are classified in two classes, defined below:\n(i) Class I\nSweet peppers in this class must be of good quality. They must be characteristic of the variety and/or commercial type as regards development, shape and colour with due regard to the degree of ripeness.\nThey must be:\n- firm,\n- practically free of blemishes.\nThe peduncle may be slightly damaged or cut with the calyx intact.\n(ii) Class II\nThis class includes sweet peppers which do not qualify for inclusion in Class I but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nThe following defects may be allowed provided the peppers retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, keeping quality and presentation:\n- defects in shape and development,\n- sunburn or slight healed injuries, with a limit of 2 cm in length for defects of elongated shape, and 1 cm2 of the total area for other defects,\n- slight dry superficial cracks not exceeding an overall cumulative length of 3 cm.\nThey may be less firm without being withered.\nThe peduncle may be damaged or cut.\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\nSize is determined by the shoulder diameter (width) of the sweet peppers. In the case of flat sweet peppers (tomato peppers) the term \"width\" means the maximum equatorial diameter.\nFor sized sweet peppers, the difference in diameter between the largest and smallest sweet pepper in the same package may not exceed 20 mm.\nThe width of sweet peppers may not be less than:\n- elongated sweet peppers (pointed): 30 mm\n- square sweet peppers (blunt) and square tapering sweet peppers (peg-top): 40 mm\n- flat sweet peppers (tomato peppers): 55 mm\nSizing is not compulsory for Class II, subject to the minimum sizes.\nThe above provisions do not apply to sweet peppers with slim pods of medium length (\"peperoncini type\") grown from particular varieties of Capsicum annuum L. var. longum. These must exceed 5 cm in length.\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\nA. Quality tolerances\n(i) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of sweet peppers not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n(ii) Class II\n10 % by number or weight of sweet peppers satisfying neither the requirements of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nB. Size tolerances\n(i) Class I\n10 % by number or weight of sweet peppers not conforming to the sizes identified within a margin of +- 5 mm including no more than 5 % of sweet peppers below the minimum size laid down. (ii) Class II\n- Sized sweet peppers\n10 % by number or weight of sweet peppers not conforming to the sizes identified within a margin of +- 5 mm including no more than 5 % of sweet peppers below the minimum size laid down.\n- Unsized sweet peppers\n5 % by number or weight of sweet peppers up to 5 mm smaller than the minimum size laid down.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and contain only sweet peppers of the same origin, variety or commercial type, quality, size (if sized) and, in the case of Class I, of appreciably the same degree of ripeness and colouring.\nHowever, a mixture of sweet peppers of different colours is allowed as long as origin, commercial type, quality and size (if sized) are uniform and there is the same number of sweet peppers of each colour.\nFor packages of sweet peppers with a maximum weight of 1 kg, uniformity is only required with respect to origin and quality. Where sweet peppers of different colours are marketed, uniformity of origin is not required.\nIn the case of sized produce, elongated sweet peppers should be sufficiently uniform in length.\nThe visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.\nB. Packaging\nThe sweet peppers must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce. The use of materials, particularly paper or stamps bearing trade specifications is allowed, provided the printing or labelling has been done with non-toxic ink or glue.\npackages must be free of all foreign matter.\nVI. PROVISIONS CONCERNING MARKING\nEach package must bear the following particulars, in letters grouped on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked, and visible from the outside:\nA. Identification\nPacker and/or dispatcher: Name and address or officially issued or accepted symbol. However, where a code (symbol) is used, the mention \"packer and/or dispatcher\" (or an equivalent abbreviation) must be placed close to this code (symbol).\nB. Nature of produce\n- \"Sweet peppers\" and the colour or colours if the contents are not visible from the outside.\n- Commercial type (\"elongated\", \"square blunt\", \"square tapering\", \"flat\") or name of the variety if the contents are not visible from the outside.\n- \"Peperoncini\" or equivalent denomination where appropriate.\nC. Origin of produce\n- Country of origin and, optionally, district where grown or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- Class\n- Size (if sized) expressed as minimum and maximum diameters or the mark \"unsized\" where appropriate\n- Net weight or number of units (optional).\nE. Official control mark (optional)"}
