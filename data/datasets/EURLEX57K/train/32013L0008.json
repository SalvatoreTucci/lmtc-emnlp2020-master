These are namely no-swivel clevis couplings (ISO 6489-5:2011), ball type couplings (ISO 24347:2005) and pin type couplings (ISO 6489-4:2004).\n(3) In order to take account of the current market situation, to minimise possible safety and economic impacts and to allow those couplings to be EC type-approved, it is necessary to include the couplings concerned and the relevant ISO standards in Directive 2009/144/EC.\n(4) Directive 2009/144/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2009/144/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1 April 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
