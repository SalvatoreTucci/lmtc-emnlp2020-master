The incomplete scientific data on the validation of the analytical method does not constitute a hazard to human health.\n(6) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species.\n(7) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use concluded that the extrapolation to other food producing species cannot be supported for this substance.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the provisional MRLs for tulathromycin in respect of bovine and porcine species, applicable to muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney. The provisional MRLs set out in that Table for bovine and porcine species should expire on 1 January 2015.\n(9) Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the\u00a0stakeholders concerned\u00a0to take measures that may be required to comply with the\u00a0newly set MRL.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 17 February 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2014\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance tulathromycin is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Tulathromycin (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S, 13S,14R)-2-ethyl-3,4,10,13-tetra-hydroxy-3,5,8,10,12,14-hexamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethy-lamino)-\u00df-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopent-decan-15-one expressed as tulathromycin equivalents Bovine 300 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Not for use in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption Anti-infectious agents/Antibiotics\u2019\nPorcine 800 \u03bcg/kg Muscle Provisional MRLs expire on 1 January 2015"}
