Moreover, this quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must therefore be added to the quantity of 305\u00a0394 tonnes.\n(10) In consequence by application of fibre yield as a quality criterion actual Spanish production of unginned cotton in the 2003/04 marketing year must be considered to total 305\u00a0417 tonnes.\n(11) Having applied the quality criterion of fibre yield, the Spanish authorities recognised as eligible for the aid 632 tonnes of unginned cotton originating from crop areas in Portugal. This quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be regarded as Portuguese actual production of unginned cotton for the 2003/04 marketing year.\n(12) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 states that if the sum of the actual production determined for Spain and Greece exceeds 1\u00a0031\u00a0000 tonnes the guide price indicated in Article 3(1) of that Regulation is to be reduced in any Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity.\n(13) For the 2003/04 marketing year the guaranteed national quantity is exceeded in both Spain and Greece. The guide price reductions for these countries are to be set in line with the percentage overshoot of the respective guaranteed national quantity.\n(14) The first subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 states that the guide price reduction in each Member State is to be 50\u00a0% of the percentage overshoot of its guaranteed national quantity.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Natural Fibres,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2003/04 marketing year actual production of unginned cotton is determined as:\n\u2014 1\u00a0006\u00a0248 tonnes for Greece,\n\u2014 305\u00a0417 tonnes for Spain,\n\u2014 632 tonnes for Portugal.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount by which the guide price is to be reduced for the 2003/04 marketing year is fixed at:\n\u2014 Greece: EUR\u00a015,201 per 100\u00a0kg of unginned cotton,\n\u2014 Spain: EUR\u00a012,012 per 100\u00a0kg of unginned cotton,\n\u2014 Portugal: EUR\u00a00 per 100\u00a0kg of unginned cotton.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 June 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Protocol as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1050/2001 (OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 1).\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 210, 3.8.2001, p. 10.
