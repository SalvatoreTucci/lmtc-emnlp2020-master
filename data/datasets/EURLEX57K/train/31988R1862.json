Imports of products listed in the Annex originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories shall, in the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, be subject to ceilings and to Community surveillance.\nThe products referred to in the first paragraph, their tariff headings, the customs duties applicable, the periods of validity and the levels of the ceilings are set out in the Annex.\n2. Quantities shall be charged against the ceilings as and when products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation, accompanied by a movement certificate.\nProducts may be charged against a ceiling only if the movement certificate is submitted before the date on which the collection of customs duties is re-established.\nThe extent to which a ceiling is used up shall be determined at Community level on the basis of the imports charged against it, in the manner specified in the preceding subparagraphs.\nMember States shall inform the Commission, at the intervals and within the time limits specified in paragraph 4, of imports effected in accordance with the above procedures.\n3. As soon as a ceiling has been reached, the Commission may adopt a regulation re-establishing, until the end of its period of validity, the customs duties applicable to third countries.\n4. Member States shall send the Commission statements of the quantities charged for the preceding month no later than the 15th day of each month. At the Commission's request, they shall send statements of the quantities charged for periods of 10 days, to be forwarded within five clear days of the end of each 10-day period.", "The Commission shall take all appropriate measures, in close cooperation with the Member States, to ensure the implementation of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 October 1988.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 1988.\nFor the Commission\nCOCKFIELD\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 61, 1. 3. 1985, p. 4.\n(2) OJ No L 172, 30. 6. 1987, p. 102.\n(3) OJ No L 172, 30. 6. 1987, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 107, 28. 4. 1988, p. 1.\nANNEX\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CN code  // Description  // Customs duty applicable (%)  // Level of ceiling (tonnes)   //    //   //   //   //   // 12.0030   // ex 0704 90 90   // Chinese cabbages, from 1 November to 31 December 1988   // 10,9  // 1 000   // 12.0060   // ex 0709 10 00   // Artichokes, from 1 October to 30 November 1988   // 9,1  // 1 000   // 12.0070   // 0802 31 00 0802 32 00   // Walnuts, from 1 January to 31 December 1989   // 4,8  // 700  // 12.0080   // ex 0809 10 00   // Apricots, from 1 October 1988 to 31 January 1989   // - from 1 October to 31 December: 17,5   //   //   //   //   // - from 1 to 31 January: 15   // 2 000   // 12.0090   // ex 0809 20 90   // Cherries, from 1 November 1988 to 28 February 1989   // - from 1 November to 31 December: 10,5   //   //   //   //   // - from 1 January to 28 February: 9   // 2 000   // 12.0100   // ex 0809 30 00  // Peaches, from 1 December 1988 to 28 February 1989   // - from 1 to 31 December: 15,4   //   //   //   //   // - from 1 January to 28 February: 13,2   // 2 000   // 12.0110   // ex 0809 40 19   // Plums, from 15 December 1988 to 28 February 1989   // - from 15 to 31 December: 5,6   //   //   //   //  // - from 1 January to 28 February: 4,8   // 2 000   //    //  //   //   //"}
