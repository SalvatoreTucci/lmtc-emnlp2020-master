Those criteria include the presentation of a pedigree certificate at the time when the customs export formalities are completed.\n(2) Certain requirements regarding the particulars to be contained in pedigree certificates are set out in Article 3(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2342/92. Those requirements derive directly from Commission Decision 86/404/EEC\u00a0(3), which was repealed and replaced by Commission Decision 2005/379/EC of 17 May 2005 on pedigree certificates and particulars for pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, their semen, ova and embryos\u00a0(4).\n(3) Some of the requirements regarding the content of pedigree certificates were clarified in Decision 2005/379/EC.
