All operators must keep at the INAO\u2019s disposal their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese must be manufactured and matured within the geographical area.\nThis cheese is predominantly lactic, left to drain naturally and slowly, and made exclusively from cow\u2019s milk that is matured and then renneted; it has a coagulation time of a minimum of 12 hours; the ripening period is of two weeks minimum.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nKnown since the Middle Ages, offered in 1513 by the inhabitants of Chaource to the Bishop and Governor of Langres, the oral tradition of this cheese dates back to the first half of the 19th century; since this period it has been sold on the regional markets and as far afield as large cities like Lyon and Paris. The designation was recognised in 1970.\nThe protected designation area is situated in a region characterised by a permeable subsoil, composed essentially of limestone and clay, and by a large number of streams and springs. Dairy cows pasture on natural meadows in summer and are given hay reaped locally as fodder in winter. The traditional manufacturing process has enabled producers to obtain added value from their cheese and maintain agricultural activities in this region.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9\nAddress : 51 rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris, France\nTel. : (33) 153 89 80 00\nFax : (33) 153 89 80 60\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut National de l\u2019Origine et de la qualit\u00e9 is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName : Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des Fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress : 59 boulevard Vincent-Auriol, 75703 Paris Cedex 13, France\nTel. : (33) 144 87 17 17\nFax : (33) 144 97 30 37\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nThe product must bear the wording \u2018Appellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2019 and the name of the designation of origin."}
