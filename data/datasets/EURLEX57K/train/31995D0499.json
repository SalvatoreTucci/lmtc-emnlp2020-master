The  increase necessary for 1994 over the amount authorized is DM 379 million, which brings the total  aid to DM 3  232 million. This compares with a total of DM 3  248 million approved by the  Commission for 1993 in its Decisions 93/151/ECSC  (3) and 94/332/ECSC  (4).\nThe reason for the increase in aid is that the gap between the world market price for coking coal  and German coal production costs has proved wider than originally foreseen, on account of the  development of the US dollar-German mark exchange rate.\nThe new figure of DM 3  232 million for this aid does not bridge the gap, for each production unit,  between the production costs and the revenue from the delivery of 18 million tonnes of coal assumed  in this Decision for the coal industry's financial year.\nThe incorporation of the intended measure in the plan for the modernization, restructuring and  rationalization of the German coal industry, the reduction of quantities and the capping of aid for  the period 1992, 1993 and 1994 are in line with the objective set in the first indent of Article 2  (1) of the Decision of making further progress towards profitability, i.  e. reducing costs, in the  light of coal prices on the world market.\nIn its assessment of the aid the Commission, in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1),  also took account of the essential need to cushion as far as possible the social and regional  consequences of restructuring.\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Decision, the procedures for granting aid help to improve the  profitability of the undertakings concerned by reducing production costs.\nGermany must ensure that this aid does not result in any discrimination between producers, between  purchasers or between consumers, in accordance with Article 4 (b) of the ECSC Treaty.\nII\nFor the above reasons and on the basis of the information supplied by the German Government,  the aid envisaged for 1994 is compatible with the aims of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market,", "main_body": ["Germany is hereby authorized to grant, for 1994, additional aid  amounting to DM 379 million for the supply of coking coal, coke and coal for injection into blast  furnaces in the Community's steel industry, which brings the total aid for this purpose in 1994 to  DM 3  232 million.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 1995.\nFor the Commission Hans VAN DEN BROEK Member of the Commission"}
