It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.\n(2) The SCCS further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.\n(3) Following the opinions of the SCCS, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products, according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCS.\n(4) Substances p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) and toluene-2,5-diamine (PTD) are currently regulated under generic entries 8 and 9 in part 1 of Annex III to Council Directive 76/768/EEC. The SCCS classified these substances as extreme sensitisers contributing to a great extent to the incidence of skin allergies among consumers to hair dye products. The risk assessment of the submitted additional data on PPD and PTD, and final decisions made by the SCCS on the safety of these substances might still require a considerable amount of time. As a precautionary measure to reduce the risk of allergies to hair dye products among consumers, the maximum authorised concentrations of PPD and PTD should be immediately decreased to the levels for which the industry submitted the safety files.\n(5) Since substances PPD and PTD are currently regulated under generic entries in part 1 of Annex III separate reference numbers should be created for these substances with decreased maximum authorised concentrations.\n(6) Commission Directive 2008/88/EC\u00a0(3) banned the use of hydroquinone in oxidative hair dye products by deleting the respective field of application in column \u2018c\u2019 of reference number 14 in Annex III, part 1. For the sake of clarity, the authorised concentration of 0,3\u00a0% in column \u2018d\u2019 and the conditions of use and warnings which must be printed on the label listed in paragraph (a) in column \u2018f\u2019 of reference number 14 should be deleted as well.\n(7) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 15 April 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
