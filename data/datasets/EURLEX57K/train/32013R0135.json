The submission by those laboratories of specific financial and technical reports on workshops should therefore no longer be required. Accordingly, the Commission should no longer be required to make specific payments following the submission and approval of those reports.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 926/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) As the amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 926/2011, introduced by this Regulation, will have no negative impact for the EU reference laboratories, this Regulation should apply retroactively from 1 January 2013. This retroactivity is necessary in order to ensure an equal treatment between EU reference laboratories in cases where workshops have been organised before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 926/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 6 is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Chapter II, the title is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 9 is amended as follows:\n(a) the title is replaced by the following:\n(b) the following paragraph is added:\n(4) Articles 10 and 11 are replaced by the following:\n(a) staff dedicated to the activities of the laboratories;\n(b) subcontracting;\n(c) capital equipment;\n(d) consumables;\n(e) the shipment of samples for comparative tests;\n(f) missions;\n(g) workshops to which at least one participant per Member State has been invited;\n(h) training activities;\n(i) meetings;\n(j) overheads.\n(a) a paper copy and an electronic version of their financial report concerning the implementation of the work programme for the previous calendar year completed in accordance with Annexes III(a) and III(b);\n(b) a technical report of their activities, certified by the laboratory\u2019s technical director.\n(5) the second paragraph of Article 12 is deleted;\n(6) Article 13 is deleted;\n(7) Chapter III is deleted;\n(8) the Annexes to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 926/2011 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 241, 17.9.2011, p. 2.\nANNEX\nThe Annexes to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 926/2011 are amended as follows:\n(1) Annexes I(a) to III(b) are replaced by the following:\nStaff costs Subcontracting Capital Equipment Consumables Shipment of samples for comparative tests Missions Workshops Training activities Meetings\nActivity 1\nActivity 2\nActivity 3\nActivity N\nTotal\nCategory\u00a0(1) Status\u00a0(2) Gross monthly salary\u00a0(3) Time spent on work programme Total eligible costs\n\n\nTOTAL:\nDescription Cost excluding VAT VAT Total cost\n\n\n\nTOTAL:\nDescription Cost excluding VAT VAT Total cost/value Date of purchase or rental Date of delivery Depreciation period (36 or 60 months) % use for work programme Annual depreciation cost\n2.1 Equipment to be acquired during the period in question\n2.2 Equipment acquired before the period in question\nTOTAL:\nDescription by type\u00a0(5) Cost excluding VAT VAT Total cost\n\n\nTOTAL:\nDescription Supplier Cost excluding VAT VAT Total cost\n\n\n\nTOTAL:\nDescription Travel expenses Hotel expenses Daily allowance Total\n\n\nTOTAL:\nCost\nParticipants\u2019 travel expenses:\nHotel expenses:\nParticipants\u2019 daily allowances:\nTOTAL:\nCost\nParticipants\u2019 travel expenses:\nHotel expenses:\nParticipants\u2019 daily allowances:\nTOTAL:\nDescription Travel expenses Hotel expenses Daily allowance Total\n\n\nTOTAL:\nSubtotal of items listed in tables at points 1 to 9\nOverheads: 7\u00a0% of subtotal\nTOTAL EXPENDITURE:\nA = period in months for which the equipment is to be used for the work programme, from the date of delivery\nB = depreciation period of 60 months (36 months in the case of computer equipment costing less than EUR 25\u00a0000)\nC = cost of equipment\nD = percentage use of equipment on the work programme\nStaff costs Subcontracting Capital Equipment Consumables Shipment of samples for comparative tests Missions Workshops Training activities Meetings\nActivity 1\nActivity 2\nActivity N\nTotal\nCategory of costs Estimated budget Declared costs\n1.
