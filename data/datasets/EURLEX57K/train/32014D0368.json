Portugal has asked for an extension of that derogation. The situation justifying that derogation remains unchanged and the derogation should therefore continue to apply. It is reasonably expected that imported potatoes will continue to comply with Union legislation. Furthermore, appropriate mechanisms are established in this Decision to ensure the monitoring of the conditions of application of the derogations. Therefore it is appropriate to extend the authorisations for derogations granted in this Decision for a longer period than the ones granted by previous Decisions and namely until 31 March 2024.\n(3) Implementing Decision 2011/778/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2011/778/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1(2), point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) for the potato-marketing seasons from 1 December to 31 March of each year until 31 March 2024.\u2019;\n(2) Article 15 is replaced by the following:\n(a) the provisions laid down in Articles 2 to 13:\n(i) are shown to be insufficient to prevent the introduction into the Union of the harmful organisms referred to in Article 2; or\n(ii) have not been complied with;\n(b) there are elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the \u201cpest free area\u201d concept in Canada.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Malta and the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0169, 10.7.2000, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0317, 30.11.2011, p.\u00a037."}
