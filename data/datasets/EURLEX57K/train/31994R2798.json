third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import  rules (1), and in particular Article 5 in conjunction with Article 25 (4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Commission proposal,\nWhereas the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 517/94, imposed Community-level quantitative limits on imports of certain textile products originating in the People's Republic of China because of the sensitivity of the relevant sectors of the Community  textile industry;\nWhereas the Council, in setting the level of these quotas, endeavoured to find a certain balance between providing the requisite protection for the relevant sectors of the Community textiles industry and maintaining an acceptable level of trade with the  People's Republic of China;\nWhereas the introduction of the quotas and their implementation on the basis of the administrative rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 517/94 have given rise to complaints from some Member States that this balance has not been satisfactorily achieved  for 1994 since disturbances in trade with the People's Republic of China have affected the business and profits of certain sectors of the Community economy engaged in the importation, marketing and processing of the products in question;\nWhereas, in view of this, and in order to facilitate the transition between the previous rules for imports and those established under Regulation (EC) No 517/94, the Commission has considered it appropriate to adapt the levels of these quotas by  increasing them appropriately for the year 1994 based in particular on the quantitative requirements transmitted by the Member States, taking into account the objective of the Commission which remains the conclusion of a bilateral agreement with the  People's Republic of China for all the products concerned which, by changing the present regime into a conventional regime, should give guarantees concerning the supply of Chinese raw materials at acceptable price conditions;\nWhereas the amounts by which the quotas for 1994 are to be increased are subject to the administrative rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and will therefore be allocated by the Commission, in accordance with Article 17 (1) and (2) of that  Regulation, in the chronological order in which notification is received from the Member States of the requests for import authorization from the date of entry into force of this Regulation;\nWhereas, in order to ensure optimal utilization of the quantities confirmed under this Regulation, the validity of the import permits should be fixed at 90 days from the date of issue by the Member States;\nWhereas these measures have not received a favourable opinion of the Committee established under Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and Article 25 (4) of the said Regulation provides that if the proposed measures are not in conformity with the opinion of the  Committee or in the absence of an opinion, the Commission shall present to the Council, without delay, a proposal for the measures to be taken,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94
