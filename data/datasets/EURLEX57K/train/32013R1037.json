That list includes IPBC.\n(2) IPBC has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 6, in-can preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 6 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(3) Denmark was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 27 June 2011 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 27 September 2013, in an assessment report.\n(5) It appears from that report that biocidal products used for product-type 6 and containing IPBC may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve IPBC for use in biocidal products for product-type 6.\n(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["IPBC shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 6, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 325, 11.12.2007, p. 3).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L 123, 24.4.1998, p. 1).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nIPBC IUPAC Name: 980\u00a0g/kg 1 July 2015 30 June 2025 6 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The purity indicated in this column was the minimum degree of purity of the active substance used for the evaluation made in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
