GENERAL RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION AND FITTING    1. Each seat must be so placed that the passenger is in no danger and creates no impediment to driving the tractor.\n2. Each seat must be firmly fixed and properly attached according to the type of tractor, to a structural member of the tractor (chassis, roll-over protection device, platform, etc.).\n3. The structural member concerned must be sufficiently strong to support a laden passenger seat.\nII. SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION RULES    1. Each seat must be at least 400 mm wide and at least 300 mm deep.\n2. Each seat must be fitted with a back-rest not less than 200 mm nor more than 250 mm high which incorporates a lateral support. The above dimensions shall not apply if there is a closed bulkhead behind the passenger. The seat cushion shall be padded or flexible.\n3. A suitable rest must be provided for the passenger's feet.\n4. There must be a clearance of at least 920 mm above the surface of the passenger seat. However, where a tractor satisfies the requirements relating to the driver's protection and seating, but its construction does not allow for such a clearance for the passenger, the clearance may be reduced to 800 mm, provided that adequate padding is provided immediately above the passenger seat at the level of the roof.\nThe upper part of the clearance allowed for the passenger may only be limited at the rear by a radius not exceeding 300 mm (see appended drawing). The vertical clearance is the vertical open space between the front edge of the seat and the roof of the tractor.\n5. The passenger seat must not add to the overall width of the tractor.\n6. There must not be more than one passenger seat per mudguard, where this is the mounting point.\nAppendix\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009530\">"}
