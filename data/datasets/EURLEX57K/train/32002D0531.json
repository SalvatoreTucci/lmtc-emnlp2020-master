Decision 2002/161/EC also establishes certain conditions on trade of live pigs and certain pig products from the areas in which the evolution of the disease would probably be influenced by the vaccination.\n(6) In accordance with the plans already approved by the Commission and the ones referring to North Rhine-Westfalia vaccination is to be applied in a single area which includes some bordering areas of Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and North Rhine-Westfalia.\n(7) For the sake of clarity, it is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2002/161/EC to include under the approval the new plans submitted by Germany referring to North Rhine-Westfalia and to ensure that the same conditions are applied in the whole area within which the evolution of the disease will probably be influenced by the vaccination.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Decision 2002/161/EC is replaced by the following Article: \"Article 1\nThe plans submitted by Germany for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs in Saarland and North Rhine-Westfalia are hereby approved.\"", "Article 2 of Decision 2002/161/EC is replaced by the following Article: \"Article 2\nThe plans submitted by Germany for emergency vaccination of feral pigs in Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and North Rhine-Westfalia are hereby approved.\"", "The Annex to Decision 2002/161/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 316, 1.12.2001, p. 5.\n(2) OJ L 126, 20.5.1999, p. 21.\n(3) OJ L 53, 23.2.2002, p. 43.\nANNEX\nRhineland-Palatinate\nThe Kreise: Ahrweiler, Bernkastel-Wittlich, Birkenfeld, Bitburg-Pr\u00fcm, Cochem-Zell, Daun, Mayen-Koblenz, Stadt Koblenz, Stadt Trier.\nIn the Kreis Kusel: Reichweiler, Pfeffelbach, Thallichtenberg, K\u00f6rborn, Dennweiler-Frohnbach, Oberalben, Ulmet, Rathsweiler, Niederalben, Homberg.\nIn the Kreis Birkenfeld: verbandsfreie Gemeinde Idar-Oberstein, Mackenrodt, Hettenrodt, Kirchweiler, Veitsrodt, Herborn, M\u00f6rschied, Weiden, Oberhosenbach, Wickenrodt, Sonnschied.\nIn the Kreis Bad Kreuznach: Bruschied, Schneppenbach, Hennweiler, Kellenbach, K\u00f6nigsau, Schwarzerden, Staatswald Entenpfuhl, Winterbach.\nIn the Kreis Rhein-Hunsr\u00fcck: Riesweiler, Argenthal, Schnorbach, M\u00f6rschbach, Rheinb\u00f6llen.\nIn the Kreis Mainz-Bingen: Breitscheid, Stadt Bacharach.\nIn the Kreis Trier-Saarburg: Taben-Rodt, Kastel-Staadt, Serrig, Stadt Saarburg, Ayl, Kanzem, Stadt Konz, Wasserliesch, Oberbillig.\nSaarland\nIn the Kreis Merzig-Wadern: Mettlach, Merzig, Beckingen, Losheim, Weiskirchen, Wadern.\nIn the Kreis Saarlouis: Dillingen, Bous, Ensdorf, Schwalbach, Saarwellingen, Nalbach, Lebach, Schmelz, Saarlouis.\nIn the Kreis Sankt Wendel: Nonnweiler, Nohfelden, Tholey.\nNorth Rhine-Westfalia\nIn the Kreis Euskirchen: the Gemeinden of Dahlem, Blankenheim, Bad M\u00fcnstereifel und Stadt Euskirchen; the Gemeinde Hellenthal; the Gemeinde Kall; the Stadt Mechernich; the Gemeinde Nettersheim.\nIn the Kreis Rhein-Sieg: Stadt Rheinbach, the Gemeinde Swisttal, Stadt Meckenheim."}
