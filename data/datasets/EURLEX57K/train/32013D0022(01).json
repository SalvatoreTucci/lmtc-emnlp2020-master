The standard criteria determining the eligibility of collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem monetary policy operations are laid down in Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.\n(2) Pursuant to Section 1.6 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Governing Council may, at any time, change the instruments, conditions, criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Pursuant to Section 6.3.1 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils its requirements for high standards on the basis of any information it may consider relevant.\n(3) Decision ECB/2013/13 of 2 May 2013 on temporary measures relating to the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus\u00a0(3) temporarily suspended, as an exceptional measure, the Eurosystem\u2019s minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds applicable to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus. Following the launch by the Republic of Cyprus of a debt management exercise involving its marketable debt instruments, the Governing Council decided that the adequacy as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus was negatively affected, and decided to repeal Decision ECB/2013/13 on 28 June 2013\u00a0(4).\n(4) Following completion of the debt management exercise and confirmation that the Republic of Cyprus is complying with the conditionality of the economic and financial adjustment programme applicable to it, the Governing Council has further assessed that marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus currently have a quality standard sufficient to warrant their eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations.\n(5) The Governing Council has therefore decided that the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus for Eurosystem monetary policy operations should again be restored, subject to applying specific haircuts to such instruments different from those provided for in Section 6.4.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.\n(6) Under Article 7 of Guideline ECB/2013/4, the Eurosystem\u2019s credit quality threshold does not apply to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the central governments of euro area Member States under a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme, unless the Governing Council decides that the respective Member State does not comply with the conditionality of the financial support and/or the macroeconomic programme. However, under Article 1(3) of the same Guideline, for the purposes of its Article 5(1) and Article 7, only Ireland, the Hellenic Republic and Portugal are considered euro area Member States compliant with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme. Therefore an additional Governing Council decision is required to waive the Eurosystem\u2019s credit quality threshold for marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus.\n(7) This exceptional measure will apply temporarily until the Governing Council considers that the normal application of the Eurosystem\u2019s eligibility criteria and risk control framework for monetary policy operations can be reintroduced,", "main_body": ["Suspension of certain provisions of Guideline ECB/2011/14 and eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eurosystem\u2019s minimum requirements for credit quality, as specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework rules for certain marketable assets in Section 6.3.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, shall be suspended for marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus.
