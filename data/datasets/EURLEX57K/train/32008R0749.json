Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. It is appropriate to provide, in Commission Regulations specific to certain quotas in the beef and veal sector, for more detailed rules on notifications concerning import licences in that sector. In particular, in order to clarify the obligations related to the closing date for notifications relating to quantities covered by import licences, such obligations should be laid down for each import tariff quota concerned and it is therefore necessary to derogate from the second subparagraph of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 on that point. The following Regulations should be amended accordingly:\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 297/2003 of 17 February 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of the tariff quota for beef and veal originating in Chile\u00a0(3),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 of 8 December 2004 laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland\u00a0(4),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 of 23 December 2005 laying down detailed rules for the application of an import tariff quota for live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg and originating in Switzerland provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(5),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 529/2007 of 11 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)\u00a0(6),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 545/2007 of 16 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)\u00a0(7),\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 558/2007 of 23 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening\u00a0(8), and\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 659/2007 of 14 June 2007 opening and providing for the administration of import tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds\u00a0(9).\n(2) The import tariff quota opened by Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 is managed on the basis of documents issued by the third country concerned. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify that the provisions of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in that Regulation.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 297/2003 is amended as follows:\n1. the following Article 9a is inserted:\n(a) no later than 31 August following the end of each import tariff quota period the quantities of products, including nil returns, for which import licences were issued in the previous import tariff quota period;\n(b) no later than 31 October following the end of each import tariff quota period the quantities of products, including nil returns, covered by unused or partly used import licences and corresponding to the difference between the quantities entered on the back of the import licences and the quantities for which they were issued.\n2. new Annexes IV, V and VI, the text of which is set out text in Annex I to this Regulation, are added.", "Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
