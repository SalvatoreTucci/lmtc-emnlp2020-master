whereas it is therefore necessary to establish jointly  the criteria enabling these requirements to be met,", "main_body": ["Aim\nFor the purpose of establishing an information system on  tourism statistics at Community level, Member States shall carry out the collection, compilation,  processing and transmission of harmonized Community statistical information on tourism supply and  demand.", "Domain of information collection and basic definitions\nFor the purposes of this  Directive, the data to be collected shall relate to:\n(a)  the capacity of collective tourist accommodation establishments The types of collective accommodation in question are as follows:\n1.  hotels and similar establishments 2.  other collective accommodation establishments, inter alia:\n2.1.  tourist campsites 2.2.  holiday dwellings 2.3.  other collective accommodation;\n(b)  guest flows in collective accommodation establishments:\nThe collection shall cover internal tourism, i.e. domestic and inbound tourism;
