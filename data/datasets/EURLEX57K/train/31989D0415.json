ANNEX I   PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY OF THE WORK PROGRAMME  The actions concern the exploitation of advanced information technologies in the field of statistics: in particular, the application of expert systems technology to the whole chain of statistical  data processing.\nThe actions are oriented to meet Member States' needs for the development of knowledge and expert systems rules, which can constitute the base for the development of expert systems with a Community dimension in the various domains of the statistics  field.\nThe programme shall consist of two parts: Part I comprises the organization of coordinated projects; Part II comprises research and development projects regarded as meriting priority in the field of official statistics and is subdivided into four  themes.\nPART I\nCoordinated projects\nThis part of the programme deals with the coordination at Community level of activities which are of general interest to the Member States and satisfy the criteria set out below. The Commission shall provide a framework within which projects can be  selected on the basis of proposals submitted by the interested parties and financial assistance can be provided for the organization of these projects.\nThe following are suitable for coordinated projects:\n- subjects which are intrinsically international in character,\n- problems arising in a similar manner in the various Member States (and possibly within the Commission) which may therefore benefit from a coordinated approach,\n- problems which have to be solved for purposes of harmonization,\n- problems arising in connection with the processing of confidential data.\nThe main feature of these projects is that a minimum number of participants coordinate their work in fields of common interest and exchange their findings.\nThe emphasis will be on projects able to produce results in a relatively short time (two to three years).\nPART II\nShared-cost projects\nThe research will be carried out by means of shared-cost research contracts to be awarded to research bodies, companies and other organizations in the Community. Community financial participation will in principle not exceed 50 % of total expenditure,  the rest normally being borne by the contractors. Alternatively, in the case of universities and research institutes carrying out projects, the Community may bear up to 100 % of the additional expenditure involved. Work will be carried out in the  following areas:\nTheme 1:\nVertical study: preparation of a complete system for automated information processing, from collection to dissemination, in a specific field (as a prototype for other fields and a reference framework for the other themes);\nTheme 2:\nDocumentation of data and statistical methods;\nTheme 3:\nAccess to statistical information;\nTheme 4:\nForecasting.\nImplementation procedures\nContracts under Part I shall be awarded by means of restricted invitations to tender. Participants will fund their own share of the work to be done and will be informed of all the results.\nContracts under Part II shall be awarded by means of public invitations to tender. They shall involve the participation of at least two partners, who are independent of each other and who may not be established in the same Member State. Public  invitation to tender shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, and summaries shall be published in the scientific journals specializing in the subject.\nANNEX II   INDICATIVE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS  millions of ecus\nPart II: Coordinated projects0,5\nPart II: Shared-cost projects3,0\nStaff and administrative costs0,5\nTOTAL  4,0"}
