Therefore, it is necessary for transparency that only imports from those countries where harmonised rules have been laid down shall be mentioned in part 1 of the Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC as being authorised.\n(3) Following Community veterinary missions, it appears that New Caledonia and the Islands of St Pierre and Miquelon are covered by sufficiently well-structured and organised veterinary services.\n(4) New Caledonia has during the last 12 months been free from foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest; no vaccinations have been carried out against any of these diseases for the past 12 months, and the importation of animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease is forbidden.\n(5) New Caledonia can be included on the list of third countries from which Member States authorise the imports of meat from wild animals and can also be listed for fresh meat and meat products of bovine animals.\n(6) The equine health situation is satisfactorily controlled by the veterinary services of St Pierre and Miquelon and, in particular, the country has been free from African horse sickness and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis for more than two years, and from dourine and glanders for more than six months.\n(7) St Pierre and Miquelon can be listed for equidae.\n(8) Since the adoption of Commission Decision 2001/611/EC of 20 July 2001 amending Decision 92/160/EEC with regard to the regionalisation of Mexico, amending Decisions 92/260/EEC, 93/195/EEC, 93/196/EEC and 93/197/EEC with regard to imports of equidae from Mexico and repealing Decisions 95/392/EC and 96/486/EC(5), Member States may again authorise imports of certain categories of equidae from certain areas in Mexico. However, a reference to the regionalisation and to the prohibition on imports of equidae for slaughter was omitted in Decision 79/542/EEC, and this should be clarified.\n(9) Countries appearing in the list being identified according to the ISO codes used by the Community legislation for the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade, the provisional status of such codes should be specified whenever appropriate.\n(10) The Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of the Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 20 October 2001.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.\n(2) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 31.\n(3) OJ L 146, 14.6.1979, p. 15.\n(4) OJ L 43, 14.2.2001, p. 38.\n(5) OJ L 214, 8.8.2001, p. 49.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX\nImports shall fulfil the appropriate animal and public health requirements.\nPART 1\nLive animals, fresh meat and meat products\n>TABLE>\nB= Bovines (including buffalo and bisson)\nS/G= Sheep/goats\nP= Pigs\nE= Equidae\nCH= Clovenhoofed animals\nX= Authorised\nO= Unauthorised\nspecial remarks\""}
