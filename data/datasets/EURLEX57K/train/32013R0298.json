The suspension should be subject to a review by the Council every three months in light of the situation on the ground.\n(4) Some of those measures fall within the scope of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and regulatory action at the level of the Union is therefore necessary in order to implement them, in particular with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 314/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation must enter into force on the day following that of its publication,", "main_body": ["The application of Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 314/2004 is suspended until 20 February 2014 in so far as it applies to persons and entities listed in the Annex to this Regulation.
