Accordingly, the list of permitted claims should include the wording of the claims and specific conditions of use of the claims, and where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinions of the Authority.\n(5) However, a number of Member States raised concerns that such authorisation with its conditions of use would promote and encourage consumption of foods containing sugars other than those naturally contained. Furthermore, it would convey a conflicting and confusing message to consumers, particularly in light of national dietary advice to reduce sugars consumption. It is considered that, for this specific health claim, conflicting objectives can be addressed, by authorising the claim only under specific conditions of use limiting its use to foods which are either low in sugars or to foods to which sugars have not been added although they may contain sugars naturally.\n(6) This Regulation should apply six months after the date of its entry into force to enable food business operators to adapt to its requirements.\n(7) In line with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Register of nutrition and health claims containing all authorised health claims should be updated in light of the present Regulation.\n(8) Comments and positions from the members of the public and interested stakeholders, received by the Commission have been adequately considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(9) Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 13 May 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 136, 25.5.2012, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Corresponding to 2232 entries (IDs) in the consolidated list.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2226.pdf\nANNEX\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 432/2012, the following entry is inserted in an alphabetical order:\nNutrient, substance, food or food category Claim Conditions of use of the claim Conditions and/or restrictions of use of the food and/or additional statement or warning EFSA Journal number Relevant entry number in the Consolidated List submitted to EFSA for its assessment\n\u2018Carbohydrates Carbohydrates contribute to the maintenance of normal brain function In order to bear the claim, information shall be given to the consumer that the beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 130\u00a0g of carbohydrates from all sources.
