The references to Regulation (EC) No 2096/2005 in Regulation No (EU) 73/2010 should therefore be updated to refer to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011.\n(2) Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 refers to standards laid down by the International Standardisation Organisation (ISO). However, since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 73/2010, the ISO has revised and re-numbered some of these standards. The references in Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 to the relevant ISO standards should therefore be updated to ensure coherence with the latest numbering and edition of these standards.\n(3) Annexes I, III and XI to Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 refer to various definitions and provisions laid down in Annex 15 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), and more specifically to its Twelfth Edition of July 2004, which incorporates Amendment No 34. Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No\u00a073/2010, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has amended a number of definitions and provisions and some of the structure of Annex\u00a015 to the Chicago Convention, most recently in its Fourteenth Edition of July 2013, which incorporates Amendment No 37. The references in Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 to Annex 15 to the Chicago Convention should therefore be updated in order to meet the Member States' international legal obligations and ensure consistency with ICAO's international regulatory framework provided.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee, established by Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) point (7) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(7) \u201cintegrated aeronautical information package\u201d (hereinafter IAIP) means a package in paper, or electronic media, which consists of the following elements:\n(a) aeronautical information publications (hereinafter AIP), including amendments;\n(b) supplements to the AIP;\n(c) the NOTAM, as defined in point 17 and pre-flight information bulletins;\n(d) aeronautical information circulars; and\n(e) checklists and lists of valid NOTAMs;\u2019\n(b) point (8) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(8) \u201cobstacle data\u201d means data concerning all fixed (whether temporary or permanent) and mobile objects, or parts thereof, that are located on an area intended for the surface movement of aircraft or that extend above a defined surface intended to protect aircraft in flight or that stand outside those defined surfaces and that have been assessed as being a hazard to air navigation;\u2019\n(c) point (10) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(10) \u201caerodrome mapping data\u201d means data collected for the purpose of compiling aerodrome mapping information;\u2019\n(d) point (13) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(13) \u201caeronautical information service provider\u201d means the organisation responsible for the provision of an aeronautical information service, certified in accordance with the requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011;\u2019\n(e) point (24) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(24) \u201ccritical data\u201d means data as classified under point (c) of the integrity classification defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of Annex 15 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (hereinafter the Chicago Convention);\u2019\n(f) point (25) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(25) \u201cessential data\u201d means data as classified under point (b) of the integrity classification defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of Annex 15 to the Chicago Convention;\u2019\n(2) In Article 7, paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n(3) In Article 10, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(4) Annex I is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.\n(5) Annex III is replaced by the text in Annex II to this Regulation.\n(6) Annex XI is replaced by the text in Annex III to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a096, 31.3.2004, p.\u00a026.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 73/2010 of 26 January 2010 laying down requirements on the quality of aeronautical data and aeronautical information for the single European sky (OJ L 23, 27.1.2010, p. 6).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2096/2005 of 20 December 2005 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services (OJ L\u00a0335, 21.12.2005, p.\u00a013).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 of 17 October 2011 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services and amending Regulations (EC) No 482/2008 and (EU) No 691/2010 (OJ L\u00a0271, 18.10.2011, p.\u00a023).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation) (OJ L\u00a096, 31.3.2004, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX I\nIn Annex I, part B, point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) be provided digitally in accordance with the ICAO standards referred to in points 9, 9a and 12 of Annex III;\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX III\nPROVISIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES AND ANNEXES\n1.
