However, it is necessary to specify that economic operators not established in the customs territory of the Community who lodge a customs declaration in the Community to place goods under the temporary importation procedure will not have to be registered for an economic operators registration and identification number (EORI number) if they discharge that procedure by re-exportation.\n(2) Economic operators established in a contracting party to the Convention on a common transit procedure, approved by Council Decision 87/415/EEC\u00a0(4), other than the European Union lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the common transit procedure and economic operators established in Andorra and San Marino lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the Community transit procedure are already assigned traders\u2019 identification numbers that can be used to identify them. They should therefore be excluded from the obligation to be registered for an EORI number. However, that exception should be limited solely to cases where the data provided in the customs declaration is not used as an entry or exit summary declaration, as an EORI number is important for performing risk analyses in such cases.\n(3) In view of Article 186 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 312/2009, Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be adapted.\n(4) In order to allow the customs office of the first port or airport of entry to forward, where relevant, information necessary to carry out an appropriate risk analysis to the customs office at any subsequent port or airport as provided for in Article 184e of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, it is necessary to add a new data requirement and the related data explanatory note to Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(5) Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should reflect the fact that in some specific cases duties are imposed under customs union agreements concluded by the European Union.\n(6) Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products\u00a0(5) has been repealed. Currently, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1741/2006\u00a0(6) lays down the conditions for granting the special export refund on boned meat of adult male bovine animals placed under the customs warehousing procedure prior to export while Commission Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006\u00a0(7) lays down special detailed rules for the application of export refunds in the case of certain preserved beef and veal products which require customs supervision and customs control during manufacturing prior to export. Annexes 37 and 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be updated accordingly.\n(7) Article 152(1)(a)a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 215/2006\u00a0(8) provides for a system whereby unit prices notified by Member States and disseminated by the Commission may be used to determine the customs value of certain perishable goods imported on consignment. That system replaces specific rules for the determination of the customs value of certain perishable goods laid down in Articles 173 to 177 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Annex 38 to that Regulation should therefore be updated.\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables\u00a0(9) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 of 21 December 2007 laying down implementing rules of Council Regulations (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96 and\u00a0(EC) No 1182/2007 in the fruit and vegetable sector\u00a0(10). That replacement should be reflected in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(11) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 612/2009 of\u00a07 July 2009 on laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(12). Box 37 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\n(10) In view of the provisions on simplified procedures set out in Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006\u00a0(13), it is necessary to update the codes for \u2018Additional information\u2019 in Box 44 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02454/93, accordingly.\n(11) Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(14) contains an obligation to lodge entry summary declarations and Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 1875/2006, provides for summary declarations for the purposes of temporary storage. Those two declarations should therefore be included in the \u2018List of abbreviations for documents\u2019 in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(12) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) In order to ensure a smooth implementation of this Regulation, it is necessary to provide Member States with time for the necessary adaptation of their computerised systems.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 41(3), point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) he lodges in the Community a summary or customs declaration other than any of the following:\n(i) a customs declaration made in accordance with Articles 225 to 238;\n(ii) a customs declaration made for temporary importation or for discharging this procedure by re-exportation;\n(iii) a customs declaration made under the common transit procedure by an economic operator established in a contracting party to the Convention on a common transit procedure other than the European Union, where that declaration is not also used as an entry or exit summary declaration;\n(iv) a customs declaration made under the Community transit procedure by an economic operator established in Andorra or in San Marino, where that declaration is not also used as an entry or exit summary declaration.\u2019;\n2.
