No maximum level was established for fish liver and processed products thereof. In order to protect public health competent authorities prohibited the placing on the market of those products because they were deemed to be unsafe.\n(4) It is appropriate to establish a Community maximum level for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in fish liver and processed products thereof to protect public health and to ensure a uniform approach in the internal market.\n(5) Taking into account the specific canning process of fish liver, the maximum level established for fresh fish liver should also apply to processed fish liver.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Section 5 (Dioxins and PCBs) of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, the following point is added:\nMaximum levels\nSum of dioxins Sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ)\n\u20185.11 Fish liver and derived products thereof with the exception of marine oils referred to in point 5.10 \u2014 25,0 pg/g wet weight (32)\u00a0(3)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Footnote 34 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(34) Foodstuffs listed in this category as defined in categories (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of the list in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, with the exclusion of fish liver referred to in point 5.11.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.
