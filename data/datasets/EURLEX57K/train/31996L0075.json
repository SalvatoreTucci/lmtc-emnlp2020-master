Carriers are asked, in the order of their registration on the rota, to choose in turn a load from those on offer. Those who make no choice nonetheless keep their position in the order;\n(b) 'carrier` shall mean an owner or an operator of one or more inland waterway vessels;\n(c) 'competent authority` shall mean the authority appointed by the Member State to manage and organize the system of chartering by rotation;\n(d) 'serious market disturbance` shall mean the emergence, in the inland waterway transport market, of problems specific to that market likely to cause a serious and potentially persistent excess of supply over demand, thereby posing a serious threat to the financial stability and survival of a large number of inland waterway carriers, unless the short and medium-term forecasts for the market in question indicate substantial and lasting improvements.", "In the field of national and international inland waterway transport in the Community, contracts shall be freely concluded between the parties concerned and prices freely negotiated.", "Notwithstanding Article 2, Member States may, for a transitional period up to 1 January 2000, maintain a system of minimum compulsory tariffs and systems of chartering by rotation, provided that:\n- there is compliance with the conditions set out in Articles 4, 5 and 6; and\n- the rotation and pricing systems imposed are freely accessible under the same conditions to all Member States' carriers.", "During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, the following shall not be subject to such systems of chartering by rotation:\n(a) oil and gas, liquid cargo and dry bulk freight, special cargoes such as heavy and indivisible loads, container transport, transport within port areas, any kind of own-account transport and any type of transport operation already outside the system of chartering by rotation;\n(b) loads which cannot be effectively dealt with by such systems, in particular:\n- transport requiring goods handling equipment,\n- combined transport, namely intermodal transport where the routes are principally by inland waterway and the initial and/or terminal legs (as short as possible) are by road or rail.", "During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, Member States shall take the necessary steps to maximize flexibility in the systems of chartering by rotation, in particular:\n- by providing shippers with the opportunity of concluding contracts for multiple trips, i.e. a series of successive trips using the same vessel,\n- by providing that single or multiple trips offered twice consecutively under the system of chartering by rotation without finding any takers shall be taken out of that system and be freely negotiated.", "Within a period of two years from the entry into force of this Directive, Member States involved in systems of chartering by rotation shall take the necessary measures to enable shippers to have a free choice between three types of contract:\n- contracts on a time basis, including leasing contracts, where the carrier makes one or more vessels and crew exclusively available to a customer for a specific period for the transport of goods for that customer against payment of a given sum of money per day. The contract is freely concluded between the parties,\n- tonnage contracts where the carrier undertakes to transport, for a period laid down in the contract, a given tonnage against payment of cargo rates by the tonne. The contract is freely concluded between the parties and must involve large consignments,\n- contracts for single or multiple trips.", "1.
