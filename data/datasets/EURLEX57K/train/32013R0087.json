The text of the first of the two labels provided for in point (d) of the second paragraph of Article 3 of that Regulation incorrectly refers to \u2018the pomace obtained after the extraction of olive oil\u2019 instead of \u2018the product obtained after the extraction of olive oil\u2019. In consequence the meaning of both labels in the Polish version of the Regulation overlaps.\n(2) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 should therefore be corrected accordingly.\n(3) In order to avoid any prejudice to the interests of those economic operators who have complied with the incorrect obligation provided for by the Polish version of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012, they should be allowed to continue using incorrect labels for a certain period. In order to minimise the duration of that period, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Concerns only the Polish version.", "Products which have been manufactured and labelled in the Union or imported into the Union and put into free circulation in accordance with the Polish version of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 before the entry into force of this Regulation may be marketed until 2 February 2014.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 12, 14.1.2012, p. 14."}
