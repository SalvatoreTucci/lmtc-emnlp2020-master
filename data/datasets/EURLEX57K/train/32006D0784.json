The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance is defined in Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases\u00a0(2).\n(2) Commission Decision 97/28/EC\u00a0(3) authorises a main method for grading pig carcases in France. Two other methods may also be used subject to the equivalence of results.\n(3) In view of technical developments in the herd, the French Government has asked the Commission to authorise the use of new formulae for the methods used under Decision 97/28/EC and has presented the elements required under Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 to this end.\n(4) Examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising these grading methods are fulfilled.\n(5) No modification of the apparata or grading methods may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained. For this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.\n(6) For the sake of clarity Decision 97/28/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The use of the following methods is hereby authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in France:\n(a) the Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM) apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex;\n(b) the CSB Ultra-Meater apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex;\n(c) the manual method (ZP) and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex.\nThe manual method (ZP) may be applied only in slaughterhouses which do not exceed a weekly slaughtering of 200 pigs.", "Notwithstanding the standard presentation referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, pig carcases may be presented with the tongue attached during weighing and grading.

Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u2018Capteur Gras/Maigre \u2014 Sydel (CGM version 01-A)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a high-definition Sydel probe 8 mm in diameter, a light-emitting infra-red diode (Honeywell) and two light sensors (Honeywell). The operating distance shall be between 0 and 95 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated using the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nG1 = the thickness of the fat (including rind), between the third and fourth last lumbar vertebrae, at 8 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to the rind (in millimetres),\nG2 = the thickness of the fat (including rind), between the third and fourth last ribs, at 6 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to this line (in millimetres),\nM2 = the thickness of the muscle, between the third and fourth last ribs, at 6 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to this line (in millimetres).\nPART 2\nCSB Ultra-Meater\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018CSB Ultra-Meater version 3.0\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a 3,5 MHz probe (Pie Medical). The operating distance shall be between 0 and 200\u00a0mm.\n3. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated using the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nG = the thickness of the fat (including rind), between the second and third last lumbar ribs, at 6 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to the rind (in millimetres),\nM = the thickness of the muscle, between the second and third last lumbar ribs, at 6 cm off the dorsal midline, at a trajectory perpendicular to the rind (in millimetres).\nPART 3\nManual method (ZP)\n1. Grading of pig carcasses shall be carried out by use of the manual method (ZP).\n2. This method may be implemented using a ruler, with the gradings determined on the basis of the prediction equation. It is based on the manual measurement on the midline of the split carcase of the thickness of the fat and of the thickness of the muscle.\n3. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nGf = the thickness of visible fat on the midline of the split carcase in millimetres, covering the glutaeus medius muscle (in millimetres),\nMf = the visible thickness of the lumbar muscle on the midline of the split carcase, measured as the shortest connection between the front (cranial) end of the glutaeus medius muscle and the upper (dorsal) edge of the vertebral canal (in millimetres)."}
