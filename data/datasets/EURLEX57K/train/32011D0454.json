As a result, it may spread from one Member State to another Member State and to third countries through trade in live pigs or their products.\n(3) Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever\u00a0(3) introduces minimum measures to be applied within the Union for the control of classical swine fever. Article 9 of Directive 2001/89/EC provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of outbreaks of that disease, where the measures laid down in Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive are to apply.\n(4) Lithuania has informed the Commission of the current classical swine fever situation on its territory, and in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2001/89/EC, it has established protection and surveillance zones where the measures referred to in Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive are applicable.\n(5) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to establish in collaboration with the Member State concerned a Union list of the restricted zones for classical swine fever in Lithuania which are the protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones).\n(6) Accordingly, the restricted zones in Lithuania should be listed in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lithuania shall ensure that the protection and surveillance zones established in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2001/89/EC comprise at least the areas listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0316, 1.12.2001, p.\u00a05.\nANNEX\nZones in Lithuania Restricted zones as referred to in Article 1 Date until applicable\nProtection zone Jonava city and the following 67 villages in Jonava district of Kaunas county: Akliai, Baranti\u0161kiai (farmstead), Bazilionys, Ber\u017eynai (farmstead), Ber\u017eai, Blauzd\u017eiai, Butk\u016bnai, Did\u0117nai, Drago\u010diai, Dukuvkos, Gabrilava, Ge\u010diai, Gegut\u0117, Gud\u017eionys, Jadvygava, Jaugeli\u0161kiai, Juod\u017eiai, Karali\u016bnai, Kaupinai, Knipai, Konceptas, Konciapolis, Konstantinava (farmstead), Krip\u010diai, Kul\u0161i\u0161kiai, Kvietku\u010diai, Liepiai, Linksmaviet\u0117, Liutk\u016bnai, Lok\u0117n\u0117liai, Luk\u0161iai, Madlinava, Ma\u010dioniai, Markuti\u0161kiai, Marvil\u0117, Melnyt\u0117l\u0117, Mik\u0161i\u0161kiai, Mimaliai, Narauninki\u0161kiai, Paber\u017e\u0117, Page\u010diai, Palankesiai, Palokiai II, Pasodos, Paulinava, Petra\u0161i\u016bnai, Prauliai, Rago\u017eiai, Rud\u0117nai, Satk\u016bnai, Skripteliai, Sta\u0161i\u016bnai, Svalkeniai, \u0160ilai, \u0160irviai, \u0160matai, \u0160ukiai, Upelis, U\u017emi\u0161kiai, Vainiai, Vaivadi\u0161kiai, Varp\u0117nai, \u017deimeliai, \u017deimiai (rail station), \u017deimiai settlement, \u017dieveli\u0161kiai, \u017dv\u0117rynai. 20 August 2011\nSurveillance zone The district of Jonava in Kaunas county (excluding territories in protection zone) and the following 23 villages in K\u0117dainiai district in Kaunas county: Akmeniai, Aukup\u0117nai, Baj\u0117ni\u0161kis, Baldinkos, Beinai\u010diai, Jovai\u0161ai, Juci\u016bnai, Liaudi\u0161kiai, Nartautai, Noci\u016bnai, Mit\u0117ni\u0161kiai, Pak\u0161\u010diai, Pa\u0161\u0117t\u0117s, P\u0117d\u017eiai, Pru\u010diai, Rimuoliai (farmstead), Sta\u0161ai\u010diai, Slikiai, Slikiai (railstation), \u0160ilainiai, \u0160\u0117ta, U\u017ekapiai and Vaini\u016bnai and 5 villages in Ukmerg\u0117s district \u2014 Manteikiai, Mara\u0161uvkos, Tarak\u0173, Palies\u0117s, Reni\u016bn\u0173. 20 August 2011"}
