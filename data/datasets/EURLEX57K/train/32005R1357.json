Furthermore, Italy did not provide any evidence from which it may be concluded that the term \u2018chevrotin\u2019 itself is generic.\n(7) Finally, Italy did not provide any evidence of non-compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.\n(8) In the light of the above, the name should thus be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee on the Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin for Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["The name in the Annex to this Regulation is hereby added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2400/96\u00a0(3).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 208, 24.7.1992, p. 1.
