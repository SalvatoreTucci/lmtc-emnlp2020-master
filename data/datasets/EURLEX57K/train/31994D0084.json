These principles have been applied by taking account of each undertaking's previous imports, by allocating  quotas to as many perspectived importers as possible, and by granting import quotas in proportion to the amount requested;\nWhereas Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 594/91 sets out the procedure according to which decisions can be taken concerning the implementation of the Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee referred to in Article 12 of the same Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
