Those Joint Undertakings are bodies set up by the Communities within the meaning of Article 185(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(7). Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 of the Council of 29 February 1968 laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of other Servants of the European Communities\u00a0(8) applies to their staff, and the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities applies to them and to their staff.\n(2) As a body set up by the Communities, it is appropriate to align the legal status of the SESAR Joint Undertaking with that of the other newly established Joint Undertakings, in order to ensure that this Joint Undertaking benefits from the same treatment as that afforded to the other newly established Joint Undertakings.\n(3) Council Decision 2006/971/EC of 19 December 2006 concerning the specific programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019 implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013)\u00a0(9) states that research will develop and implement an innovative Air Traffic Management (ATM) system within the context of the SESAR initiative, which will also ensure the most effective coordination of the development of the ATM systems in Europe.\n(4) According to the annual work programmes for 2007 and 2008 concerning the Specific Programme \u2018Cooperation\u2019, Transport (including aeronautics), implementing the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013), the Commission will provide annual contributions from the Seventh Framework Programme to the SESAR Joint Undertaking for a total estimated amount of EUR 350 million over the entire programme.\n(5) The multi-annual work programme for grants in the field of trans-European Transport networks for the period 2007-2013 identifies the SESAR project to modernise ATM in Europe as a major horizontal priority by allocating to it an estimated budget of EUR 350 million over that period.\n(6) The Commission estimates that the Community\u2019s contribution to the SESAR Joint Undertaking will be EUR 700 million, which will come in equal parts from the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development and from the Trans-European transport networks programme.\n(7) As the Joint Undertaking is a body set up by the Communities, its decision-making process should guarantee the Community\u2019s decision-making autonomy, in particular in respect of; issues having an impact on the strategic orientation of the Joint Undertaking, the Community\u2019s contribution, and the independence and equal treatment of the Joint Undertaking\u2019s staff.\n(8) An administrative agreement should be concluded between the SESAR Joint Undertaking and Belgium concerning privileges and immunities and other support to be provided by Belgium to the Joint Undertaking.\n(9) In order to ensure the efficient management of the resources provided to the Joint Undertaking for its research activities and to ensure that, as far as possible, the Joint Undertaking receives the same treatment as other comparable undertakings, it is necessary to ensure that the fiscal matters of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities are applied retroactively from an appropriate date.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 219/2007\nRegulation (EC) No 219/2007 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1, paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n2.
