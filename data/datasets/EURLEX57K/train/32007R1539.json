The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by the United Kingdom in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2006, the average ageing period for Scotch whisky in 2006 was six years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway.
