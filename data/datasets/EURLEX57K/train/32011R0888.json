Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Diclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, was authorised for 10 years in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying up to 16 weeks and turkeys up to 12 weeks by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3). The additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Its use has further been authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1118/2010\u00a0(4), for guinea fowls by Commission Regulation (EU) No 169/2011\u00a0(5) and for rabbits by Commission Regulation (EC) No 971/2008\u00a0(6).\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) in conjunction with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of diclazuril as a feed additive for turkeys for fattening, requesting that additive be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 16\u00a0March 2011\u00a0(7) that, under the proposed conditions of use, diclazuril does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment, and that it is effective in controlling coccidiosis in turkeys for fattening. It concluded that no safety concerns would arise for users provided that appropriate protective measures are taken. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of diclazuril shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a consequence of a new authorisation being granted by this Regulation, the entry in Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 concerning diclazuril should be deleted.\n(7) Since the modifications to the conditions of authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of premixtures and compound feed containing this preparation, as authorised by Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 for use on turkeys up to 12 weeks.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019 is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The entry in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 concerning the diclazuril for turkeys, identified with registration number 27, is deleted.", "Premixtures and compound feed labelled in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC and containing diclazuril, as authorised by Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 for use on turkeys up to 12 weeks, may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 September 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 317, 3.12.2010, p. 5.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 49, 24.2.2011, p. 6.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 265, 4.10.2008, p. 3.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(4):2115.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition:\nDiclazuril: 0,50\u00a0g/100\u00a0g.\nProtein-poor soybean meal: 99,25\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nPolyvidone K 30: 0,20\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nSodium hydroxide: 0,05\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nCharacterisation of the active substance:\nDegradation compound (R064318): \u2264 0,1\u00a0%\nOther related impurities (T001434, R066891, R068610, R070156, R070016): \u2264 0,5\u00a0% individually\nTotal impurities: \u2264 1,5\u00a0%\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1):\nFor determination of diclazuril in feed: reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Ultraviolet detection at 280\u00a0nm (Regulation (EC) No 152/2009)\nFor determination of diclazuril in poultry tissues: HPLC coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) using one precursor ion and two product ions.\n1.
