It is appropriate to extend the scope of Directive 2002/55/EC so that it applies to the same genera and species as Directive 92/33/EEC.\n(2) Directives 2002/55/EC and 92/33/EEC do not include Zea mays L. (popcorn or sweetcorn), a plant which is largely grown in certain new Member States. It is appropriate to extend the scope of both Directives to Zea mays L. Although maize, including popcorn and sweetcorn, is classified as a cereal under the legislation concerning the common agricultural policy, seed for sowing of sweet corn and popcorn must be submitted to the specific legislation concerning the marketing of seed of vegetables.\n(3) In the light of the development of scientific knowledge, a number of the botanical names used in Directives 92/33/EEC and 2002/55/EC have been shown to be incorrect or of doubtful authenticity. Those names should be aligned with those normally accepted internationally.\n(4) Directives 92/33/EEC and 2002/55/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["The genera and species listed in Annex II to Directive 92/33/EEC are replaced by those listed in the Annex to this Directive.", "Directive 2002/55/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
