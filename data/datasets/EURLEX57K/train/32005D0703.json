Therefore, the implementation period laid down in Article 1 of Decision 2000/439/EC is from 2000 to 2005.\n(4) Due to an underestimation of the length of the necessary administrative and financial procedures, it proved impossible to follow the procedure of preparation and decision making in the year before the execution of the national programmes. Instead, the administrative and financial procedures have proved to take place within the same year as the execution itself. Therefore, the reference period laid down in Article 1 of Decision 2000/439/EC should be changed in order to cover the period of execution from 2001 to 2006.\n(5) The financial reference laid down in Article 1 of Decision 2000/439/EC does no longer reflect the actual needs proved true for the previous years and the updated estimations for the following years. Furthermore it does not take into account the needs of the new Member States. Therefore, the reference should be adapted to the updated estimations.\n(6) Decision 2000/439/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2000/439/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(2), the first sentence shall be replaced by the following:\n2. in Article 4(3)(b), the words \u2018for the following year\u2019 shall be deleted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 6 October 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
