Directive as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1).\n(2) OJ L 209, 6.8.2002, p. 5.\nANNEX I\nAnnex I to Directive 2002/69/EC is amended as follows:\n1. In point 4 \"Sampling plans\", the following point 4.1 \"Specific provisions for the sampling of lots containing whole fishes\" is inserted after Table 2:\n\"4.1. Specific provisions for the sampling of lots containing whole fishes\nThe number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot is defined in Table 1. The aggregate sample uniting all incremental samples shall be at least 1 kg (see point 3.5).\n- In case the lot to be sampled contains small fish (individual fish weighing &lt;  1 kg), the whole fish is taken as incremental sample to form the aggregate sample. In case the resulting aggregate sample weighs more than 3 kg, the incremental samples can consist of the middle part, weighing each at least 100 grams, of the fish forming the aggregate sample. The whole part to which the maximum level is applicable is used for homogenisation of the sample.\n- In case the lot to be sampled contains larger fish (individual fish weighing more than 1 kg), the incremental sample consists of the middle part of the fish. Each incremental sample weighs at least 100 grams. In case the lot to be sampled consist of very large fish (e.g.  &gt; 6 kg) and taking a piece of the middle part of the fish would result in significant economic damage, taking three incremental samples of at least 350 grams each can be considered sufficient, independently of the size of the lot.\"\n2. Point 5 \"Compliance of the lot or sublot with the specification\" is replaced by the following:\n\"5. Compliance of the lot or sublot with the specification\nThe lot is accepted if the analytical result of a single analysis does not exceed the respective maximum level as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001, taking into account the measurement uncertainty.\nThe lot is non-compliant with the maximum level as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001, if the analytical result confirmed by duplicate analysis and calculated as the mean of at least two separate determinations exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt, taking into account the measurement uncertainty.\nThe taking into account of the measurement uncertainty can be done according to one of the following approaches:\n- by calculating the expanded uncertainty, using a coverage factor of 2, which gives a level of confidence of approximately 95 %,\n- by establishing the decision limit (CC\u00ce\u0105) according to the provisions of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC of 12 August 2002 implementing Council Directive 96/23/EC concerning the performance of analytical methods and the interpretation of results(1) (point 3.1.2.5 of the Annex - the case of substances with established permitted levels).\nThe present interpretation rules apply for the analytical result obtained on the sample for official control. In case of analysis for defence or referee purposes, the national rules apply.\"\n(1) OJ L 221, 17.8.2002, p. 8.
