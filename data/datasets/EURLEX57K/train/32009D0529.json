On 2 February 2009 Swaziland requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information received from Swaziland, it is still unable to satisfy the rules on cumulation of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 since it needs to source non-originating poly fibres in South Africa for the manufacture of the final product. Hence, the final product does not comply with the rules laid down in that Annex. Given that Swaziland needs more time to prepare itself to comply with the rules of origin, a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(2) Decision 2008/820/EC applied until 31 December 2008 because it was expected that the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the SADC EPA region would enter into force or would be provisionally applied before that date.\n(3) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations to them are to be superseded by the rules of the SADC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement of which the entry into force or the provisional application is now foreseen to take place in 2009.\n(4) It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the ACP countries to the Community as well as a smooth transition to the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. Decision 2008/820/EC should therefore be prolonged with effect from 1 January 2009.\n(5) Decision 2008/820/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/820/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
