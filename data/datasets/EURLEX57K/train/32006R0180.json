Given that the quantities concerned are minimal and the impact on the Community sugar market and the supply of raw sugar to Community refineries for that delivery period was negligible, Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 should not be applied to India, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire or Madagascar and the quantities not delivered should be added to the delivery obligations for those countries for the 2005/06 delivery period, in accordance with Article 12(4) of that Regulation.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 notwithstanding, paragraph 1 of that Article shall not apply as regards the quantities registered as not delivered for the 2004/05 delivery period in the case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, India and Madagascar.\nThe quantities not delivered referred to in paragraph 1 shall be added to the delivery obligations referred to in Article 2.", "The delivery obligations for imports originating in the countries that are signatories to the ACP Protocol and to the Agreement with India in respect of products falling within CN code 1701, expressed in white-sugar equivalent, in the 2005/06 delivery period for each exporting country concerned, shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.
