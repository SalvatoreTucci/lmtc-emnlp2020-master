Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the micro-organism preparation of Lactobacillus farciminis CNCM MA 67/4R for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) expressed its opinion on the use of this preparation on 11 July 2006. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised for four years.\n(6) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105), endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553), subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 2107), polygalacturonase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94) for turkeys for fattening. On 15 June 2006 EFSA delivered its opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category targeted or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised for four years.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74252) was provisionally authorised for the first time for laying hens and piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2188/2002\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(8) The use of the preparation of sodium benzoate, propionic acid and sodium propionate was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs and dairy cows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1252/2002\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that preservative preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preservative preparation, as specified in Annex IV to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(9) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(5).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised for four years as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised for four years as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex III, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Preservatives\u2019, as specified in Annex IV, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
