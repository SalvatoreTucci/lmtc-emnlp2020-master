The entries in the list concerning oranges from Egypt and coriander leaves, basil and mint from Thailand should therefore be deleted.\n(5) In addition, the list should be amended by increasing the frequency of official controls for the commodities for which the same sources of information show a higher degree of non-compliance with the relevant Union legislation, thereby warranting an increased level of official controls. The entries in the list concerning dried spices from India, betel leaves from India and Thailand and vine leaves from Turkey should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In order to ensure consistency and clarity, it is appropriate to replace Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0165, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC (OJ L\u00a0194, 25.7.2009, p.\u00a011).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFeed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) TARIC sub-division Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks (%)\nDried grapes (vine fruit) 0806\u00a020  Afghanistan (AF) Ochratoxin A 50\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), in shell\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), shelled\n\u2014\n\u2014 Peanut butter\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved\n\u2014 2008\u00a011\u00a091;\n(Feed and food)\n\u2014 Yardlong beans\n\u2014 ex\u00a00708\u00a020\u00a000;\n\u2014 Aubergines\n\u2014 0709\u00a030\u00a000;\n(Food \u2014 fresh, chilled or frozen vegetables)\nChinese celery (Apium graveolens) ex\u00a00709\u00a040\u00a000 20 Cambodia (KH) Pesticide residues analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS or with single-residue methods\u00a0(3) 50\nBrassica oleracea ex\u00a00704\u00a090\u00a090 40 China (CN) Pesticide residues analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS or with single-residue methods\u00a0(5) 50\nTea, whether or not flavoured 0902  China (CN) Pesticide residues analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS or with single-residue methods\u00a0(6) 10\n\u2014 Aubergines\n\u2014 0709\u00a030\u00a000;\n\u2014 Bitter melon (Momordica charantia)\n\u2014 ex\u00a00709\u00a099\u00a090;\n(Food \u2014 fresh, chilled or frozen vegetables)\n\u2014 Yardlong beans\n\u2014 ex\u00a00708\u00a020\u00a000;\n\u2014 Peppers (sweet and other than sweet) (Capsicum spp.)\n\u2014 0709\u00a060\u00a010;\n\u2014 0710\u00a080\u00a051;\nStrawberries (fresh) 0810\u00a010\u00a000  Egypt (EG) Pesticide residues analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS or with single-residue methods\u00a0(8) 10\nPeppers (sweet and other than sweet) (Capsicum spp.) 0709\u00a060\u00a010;
