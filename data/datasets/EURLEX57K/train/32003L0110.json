Rules binding on all the Member States contribute furthermore to legal certainty and standardisation of procedures.\n(2) Removal by air is increasingly gaining in importance for the purpose of terminating the residence of third-country nationals. Despite the efforts of the Member States to give priority to using direct flights, it may be necessary, from an economic viewpoint or insufficient availability of direct flights, to use flight connections via airports of transit of other Member States.\n(3) The Council recommendation of 22 December 1995 on concerted action and cooperation in carrying out removal measures(1) and the decision of the Executive Committee of 21 April 1998 on cooperation between the Contracting Parties in returning third-country nationals by air, (SCH/Com-ex (98) 10)(2) already address the need for cooperation between Member States in the field of removal by air of third-country nationals.\n(4) The sovereignty of the Member States, particularly with regard to the use of direct force against third-country nationals resisting removal should remain unaffected.\n(5) The Convention of 14 September 1963 on Offences and Certain Other Acts committed on board Aircraft (Tokyo Convention), particularly with regard to the on-board powers of the pilot responsible and matters of liability should remain unaffected.\n(6) With regard to the briefing of airlines as to how to conduct unescorted and escorted removals, reference is made to Annex 9 to the Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) of 7 December 1944.\n(7) Member States are to implement this Directive with due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967 and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In accordance with the applicable international obligations, transit by air should be neither requested nor granted if in the third country of destination or of transit the third-country national faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or if his life or liberty would be at risk by reason of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political conviction.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3).\n(9) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this Directive, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the extent that it applies to third-country nationals who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for a short stay applicable within the territory of a Member State by virtue of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, in accordance with Article 5 of the abovementioned Protocol, Denmark is to decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Directive, whether it will implement it in its national law or not.\n(10) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of these two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(4), to the extent that it applies to third-country nationals who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for a short stay applicable within the territory of a Member State by virtue of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point C, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(5).\n(11) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, these Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and therefore, subject to Article 4 of that Protocol, are not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(12) This Directive constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the 2003 Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Directive is to define measures on assistance between the competent authorities at Member State airports of transit with regard to unescorted and escorted removals by air.", "For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) \"third-country national\" means any person who is not a national of a Member State of the European Union, the Republic of Iceland or the Kingdom of Norway;\n(b) \"requesting Member State\" means the Member State which enforces a removal order in respect of a third-country national and requests transit via the airport of transit of another Member State;\n(c) \"requested Member State\" or \"transit Member State\" means the Member State via whose airport of transit the transit is to be effected;\n(d) \"escort\" means all persons from the requesting Member State responsible for accompanying the third-country national, including persons responsible for medical care and interpreters;\n(e) \"transit by air\" means the passage of the third-country national and, if necessary, the escort through the area of the airport of the requested Member State for the purposes of removal by air.", "1. A Member State wishing to return a third-country national by air shall examine whether it is possible to use a direct flight to the country of destination.\n2. If a Member State wishing to return a third-country national cannot for reasonable practical circumstances use a direct flight to the country of destination, it can request transit by air via another Member State. An application for transit by air shall in principle not be made if the removal measure requires a change of airport on the territory of the requested Member State.\n3.
