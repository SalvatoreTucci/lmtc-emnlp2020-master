To obtain good-quality fat cover, maximum linoleic acid content should be equivalent to 2\u00a0% of dry matter in the diet. Whey and buttermilk must not total more than 15 litres/head/day.\n\u2018Buttermilk\u2019 means the by-product of butter production and \u2018whey\u2019 the by-product of curds.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area\nRearing of the pigs: the raw material used to produce \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 is pigmeat which must come from animals born and reared on farms located in Vicenza province.\nThe genetic characteristics of the animals that may be used must be those of pure breeds, or crossbreeds obtained without genetic manipulation, of traditional breeds such as Large White, Landrace and Duroc listed in the Italian national herd-book or non-Italian herd-books recognised by the Italian national herd-book and with aims that comply with the latter for the production of heavy pigs.\nThe pigs must be capable of achieving a considerable weight at the time of slaughter (130\u00a0kg deadweight).\nThe minimum age at slaughter is nine months. This may be verified on the basis of the data shown on the mark tattooed on their leg (or ear) in the first 30 days following birth. The housing and facilities on pig farms must be properly insulated and aired to ensure the correct temperature, optimal renewal of the air and the removal of harmful gases. Floor surfaces must be made of water-repellent, thermal and non-slip materials.\nGiven the type of feeding practised, all housing and facilities must satisfy anti-corrosion requirements.\nFree range or semi-free range pigs may also be used.\nSlaughter: the pigs must be slaughtered at establishments that hold the hygiene and health permits provided for by Italian and EU law and are located within the recognised PDO area.\nSlaughtered pigs must weigh 130\u00a0kg deadweight or more.\nMeat from pigs affected by evident myopathies (PSE, DFD, after-effects of previous manifest inflammatory and traumatic conditions) established by a veterinarian at the slaughterhouse may not be used for processing.\nProcessing of the meat: the meat must be processed and the product matured in establishments located within the defined area. Processing establishments must hold the health and hygiene permits provided for by Italian and EU law.\nRecipe and ingredients: the production of \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 uses all the most valuable parts of the selected half-carcase, such as the leg, neck, shoulder, belly, neck fat and loin.\nThe added ingredients, permitted in the following maximum quantities, are:\n\u2014 salt: 2\u00a0700\u00a0g/100\u00a0kg of mix,\n\u2014 \u00bc cracked pepper: 300\u00a0g/100\u00a0kg of mix,\n\u2014 mixture of finely ground herbs and spices (cinnamon, cloves and rosemary): 50\u00a0g/100\u00a0kg of mix,\n\u2014 garlic: 100\u00a0g/100\u00a0kg of mix,\n\u2014 sugars: 150\u00a0g/100\u00a0kg of mix,\n\u2014 potassium nitrate within permitted limits,\nProduction method: the production method is as follows:\nThe pig half-carcases are cut and the cuts are chilled at a temperature of between 0\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C for 24 hours or more. They are then boned and trimmed and the nerves are removed.\nThe selected cuts are minced in a meat grinder fitted with perforated plates with holes between 6\u00a0mm and 7\u00a0mm in diameter. The premixed ingredients are added to the minced meat at a temperature of between\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0\u00b0C. Indigenous microbial cultures may be added to start fermentation. All the ingredients are then well mixed so that the fat combines with the lean until it borders on being homogenised. The resulting mixture is placed in natural gut casings with a diameter of 8\u00a0cm or more.\nThe cased product is marketed at the following weights: 1-1,5\u00a0kg, 1,5-2,5\u00a0kg, 2,5-3,5\u00a0kg, 3,5-8\u00a0kg.\nDrying: the drying process comprises: (a) draining for 12 hours at 20-24\u00a0\u00b0C; (b) drying for four to five days at decreasing temperatures ranging from 22-24\u00a0\u00b0C to 12-14\u00a0\u00b0C.\nMaturing: the maturing period for \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019, including draining and drying, depends on size:\n60 days or more for sizes between 1 and 1,5\u00a0kg;\n80 days or more for sizes between 1,5 and 2,5\u00a0kg;\n90 days or more for sizes between 2,5 and 3,5\u00a0kg;\n120 days or more for sizes between 3,5 and 8\u00a0kg.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2014\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe name \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina DOP\u2019 is untranslatable and must appear on the label in clear, indelible letters.\nThe brand name \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina DOP\u2019 must be shown on the label in accordance with the instructions contained in the illustrated handbook: Annex A to the specification.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area of \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 covers Vicenza province in its entirety.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe stages in the maturing process are affected by the air humidity conditions, which reflect temperature changes. These conditions give rise to the first- and second-stage fermentation undergone by the sausage.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nWhen placed on the market \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 has the following characteristics:\nPhysical characteristics\nExternal appearance: cylindrical in shape, bound with colourless twine, which may be elasticated, fastened vertically and with a series of rings made of the same material, placed horizontally on top of the fastening along the entire length of the \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa\u2019. Netting may not be used for binding. Where the product contains garlic, coloured twine may be used, although for the end section (eyelet) only. The rings, of which there must be at least three, are placed at intervals of 2-4\u00a0cm. The outer surface has a light-coloured patina which develops naturally during the maturing process.\nAppearance on cutting: the meat appears dense and at the same time tender. Slices contain a mixture with fat globules distributed in a way that surrounds the pieces of meat so that the product remains soft, even after a lengthy maturing period. Slices are slightly dull in colour, with no clear distinguishing lines between fat and lean, and of medium-large grain.\nChemical characteristics\nTotal protein content: 15\u00a0% or more; fat content: between 30\u00a0% and 43\u00a0%; mineral salts (ash): between 3,5\u00a0% and 5\u00a0%; moisture content less than 55\u00a0%; pH between 5,4 and 6,2.\nMicrobiological characteristics\nMesophilic microbe content: prevalence of lactic bacteria and Micrococcaceae.\nOrganoleptic characteristics\nAroma : spicy, possibly with fragrances of aromatic herbs, with or without garlic;\nFlavour : delicate, slightly sweet and peppery or garlicky;\nColour : pink, tending to red;\nConsistency : medium-large grain, easy to chew.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for a PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for a PGI)\nThere is, at all stages in its production, a close link between \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 and its environment.\nIn human terms, the product\u2019s link with its environment is demonstrated by the fact that the area of production \u2014 known as the Vicentino \u2014 has traditionally been the home of numerous farmers and/or artisans who, by using characteristic methods for rearing pigs and processing and maturing their meat, created the \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019, a truly one-of-a-kind product whose method of preparation has remained almost unchanged over time.\nEvidence of the link with the environment is to be found in the specific characteristics of the raw material, based on the products \u2014 traditional and consisting almost entirely of high-quality cereals grown locally \u2014 used for fattening the pigs.\nAnother link between the raw material and the local area lies in the use of whey from the cheese-making industry in the feed, which is preferably given in the form of a mash. This is a very long-standing practice, demonstrated by the fact that Vicenza province is a producer of two major PDO cheeses (Asiago and Grana Padano).\nThe whey is a by-product of the milk processing involved in the production of these two PDO cheeses.\nThis by-product is strongly marked by the properties of the milk and, in particular, by those of the process of separation of the substances that form the cheeses, logically giving rise to the elements that remain unused and thus characterise the whey.\nFarms in the Vicentino use this type of whey because of the specific characteristics it imparts to the pigmeat and hence to the processed product subsequently manufactured.\nThe economic aspects connected with the use of whey, a feedingstuff with a very low concentration of nutritional substances owing to its very high water content, have always meant that the whey from these cheeses is used as feed on a strictly local basis, thus creating a tradition for using it in the diet of the pigs used for the production of \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019.\nEvidence of the link with the environment is also to be found in the presence in Vicenza province of processors with small-scale slaughtering and processing establishments which use pigs from local farms and have continued over the years to employ traditional methods for producing \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 which are typical of the Vicentino\u2019s farming customs.\nThe stages in the maturing process are affected by the air humidity conditions, which reflect temperature changes. These conditions give rise to the first- and second-stage fermentation undergone by the sausage.\nThis link with the natural and human environment has created a unique product whose special characteristics have distinguished, and continue to distinguish, the \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa\u2019 produced in the Vicentino from similar sausage products from other areas, as demonstrated by the historical sources.\nReference to the publication of the specification\nThe Ministry launched the national objection procedure with the publication of the proposal for recognising \u2018Sopr\u00e8ssa Vicentina\u2019 as a protected designation of origin in Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 73 of 28 March 2009.\nThe full text of the product specification is available on the following website: www.politicheagricole.it/DocumentiPubblicazioni/Search_Documenti_Elenco.htm?txtTipoDocumento=Disciplinare%20in%20esame%20UE&txtDocArgomento=Prodotti%20di%20Qualit%E0>Prodotti%20Dop,%20Igp%20e%20Stg\nor via the home page of the Ministry for Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (www.politicheagricole.it): click on \u2018Prodotti di Qualit\u00e0\u2019 (on the left of the screen) then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE (Reg CE 510/2006)\u2019."}
