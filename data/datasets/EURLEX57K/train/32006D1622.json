Therefore, networks of former official European Capitals of Culture should be encouraged to play a constructive role in sharing their experiences and best practice with future European Capitals of Culture, notably on the basis of exchanges during the preparation phase.\n(11) It is important to reward the quality of the programme in terms of the objectives and criteria of the action and particularly the European added value by awarding a pecuniary prize.\n(12) To safeguard the long-term effect of the European Capital of Culture event it is desirable to use the initiative, and the structures and capacities that it creates, as the basis for a lasting cultural development strategy for the cities concerned.\n(13) To enable third countries to take part in European cultural initiatives, the European Cultural Month\u00a0(4), or a comparable initiative, should be explored.\n(14) The designation process laid down in this Decision needs a period of six years to be implemented; this six-year period cannot be guaranteed for the years 2011 and 2012 given that this Decision enters into force in 2007. For these years, a designation process is therefore provided.\n(15) In the interests of clarity, Decision No 1419/1999/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nA Community action entitled \u2018European Capital of Culture\u2019 is hereby established in order to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual understanding between European citizens.", "Access to the action\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cities in Member States and in countries acceding to the European Union after 31 December 2006 shall be entitled to be designated as European Capitals of Culture for one year, in the order set out in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The designation shall apply to one city in each of the Member States appearing in the list in the Annex.\nThe chronological order given in that list may be altered by mutual agreement between the Member States concerned.", "Applications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every application shall include a cultural programme with a European dimension, based principally on cultural cooperation, in accordance with the objectives and action provided for by Article 151 of the Treaty.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cultural programme of the event shall be created specifically for the European Capital of Culture year, highlighting the European added value in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 4.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programme shall be consistent with any national cultural strategy or policy of the relevant Member State or, where applicable under a Member State*s institutional arrangements, any regional cultural strategies, on condition that any such strategy or policy does not aim to restrict the number of cities which may be considered for designation as European Capitals of Culture under this Decision.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The programme shall last one year.
