However, a limited part of the feed formula of rations may comprise in-conversion feedingstuffs as defined in Article 4, point 24, of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.\n(2) Producers in certain Member States are currently facing a deficiency of organic feed, due to below average harvests of organic crops, reinforced legal requirements regarding organic origin of feed and expanding markets for organic produce. In order to alleviate that deficiency, it is considered appropriate to provide, during a limited period, for an increase of the percentage of in-conversion feedingstuffs that may be included in the feed ration.\n(3) A temporary increase of the allowed percentage of in-conversion feedingstuffs will also secure future supplies of organic feed and create incentives for farmers to convert to organic farming by improving the market for in-conversion fodder.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
