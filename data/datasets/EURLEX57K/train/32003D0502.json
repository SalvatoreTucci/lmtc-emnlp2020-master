A corresponding notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3).\n(5) The investigation confirmed the complainant's legal claim that the C-57 Amendment to the Canadian Trade-Marks Act violates Articles 23.1 and 2 as well as Article 24.3 (the so-called standstill clause) of TRIPS and that such infringements cannot be justified on the basis of the exception under Article 24.6 of TRIPS.\n(6) The examination procedure also confirmed that Bordeaux wines have a considerable market share in Canada, which is strictly connected with the Bordeaux/M\u00e9doc product's name. If such an asset is not duly protected, holders of the \"Bordeaux\" and \"M\u00e9doc\" geographical indications could see their market position in Canada seriously curtailed. This prejudice could eventually result in adverse trade effects for the producers of \"Bordeaux\" and \"M\u00e9doc\" wine. It can therefore be concluded that the C-57 Amendment threatens to cause adverse trade effects to the complainant, within the meaning of Article 2(4) and 10(4) of the Regulation.\n(7) On 12 February 2003, the Advisory Committee established by the Regulation considered the final report on the examination procedure.\n(8) On 24 April 2003, the Commission initialled a bilateral agreement with Canada on trade in wine and spirits, which once it has entered into force, would contribute to the protection of Community interests in this field. In particular, this agreement would provide for the definitive elimination of the names listed as \"generic\" in Canada, including \"Bordeaux\", \"M\u00e9doc\" and \"Medoc\" by the entry into force of the agreement.\n(9) However, the procedure cannot be terminated until the denominations \"Bordeaux\", \"M\u00e9doc\" and \"Medoc\" are effectively eliminated from the list of generics of the C-57 Amendment.\n(10) The Commission considers therefore that it is appropriate to suspend the procedure.\n(11) The measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee,", "main_body": ["The examination procedure concerning obstacles to trade, consisting of trade practices maintained by Canada in relation to certain geographical indications for wines, is hereby suspended."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 June 2003.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 349, 31.12.1994, p. 71.\n(2) OJ L 41, 23.2.1995, p. 3.\n(3) OJ C 124, 25.5.2002, p. 6."}
