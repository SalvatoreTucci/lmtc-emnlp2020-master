Use of the marker vaccines already authorised for marketing in the Community can, therefore, be envisaged in the event of emergency vaccination of domestic pigs.\n(6) Recent experience regarding the control of classical swine fever in feral pigs in the Community suggests that vaccination of such pigs by means of a vaccine administered via oral baits can be effective.\n(7) For the purpose of reinforcing the Community capability to respond to classical swine fever, it is necessary to purchase an adequate number of doses of marker vaccine and of vaccine to be administered via oral baits and to make arrangements for keeping them in stock and having them rapidly available in case of an emergency.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall purchase as soon as possible 1\u00a0800\u00a0000 doses of marker vaccine against classical swine fever.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall make arrangements for the storage and distribution of the vaccine referred to in paragraph 1.", "The maximum cost of the measures referred to in Article 1 shall not exceed 1\u00a0500\u00a0000\u00a0EUR.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall purchase as soon as possible 500\u00a0000 doses of vaccine against classical swine fever to be administered orally to feral pigs.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community shall make arrangements for the storage and distribution of the vaccine referred to in paragraph 1.", "The maximum cost of the measures referred to in Article 3 shall not exceed 500\u00a0000\u00a0EUR.", "The measures provided for in Article 1(2) and Article 3(2) shall be carried out by the Commission in cooperation with the suppliers designated by call for tender.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
