whereas the detailed arrangements must  be fixed by an exchange of letters between the Community and Tunisia; whereas, since that exchange  of letters has not yet taken place, the Community arrangements which applied in 1990 should be  renewed until 31 December 1991; whereas a duty-free Community tariff quota of 100 tonnes should  therefore be opened;\nWhereas the wine in question is subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price;  whereas, in order that such wine may benefit from this tariff quota, Article 54\nof Regulation (EEC)  No 822/87 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1325/90 (10), must be complied with;\n\u00b9\nwhereas the wine must be put up in containers holding two litres or less;

whereas to keep this arrangement it is  fitting to open the quotas in question with the consequence that the quotas by applying the pro  rata clause, must be fixed at respectively 44 166 tonnes, 4 666 tonnes and 3 500 tonnes; whereas  furthermore, tariff dismantling for tomatoes and onions, fresh or chilled, shall enter into force  respectively from 1 January to 30 April 1991 and from 1 May to 15 May 1991; whereas these Community  tariff quotas in question should therefore be opened with the consequence that the quotas by  applying the pro rata clause must be respectively fixed at 62 545 tonnes and 4 524 tonnes;\nWhereas, within the limits of these tariff quotas, customs duties are to be phased out over the  same periods and at the same rates as provided for in Articles 75, 243 and 268 of the Act of  Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas for wines, of designated origin, Spain and Portugal are to  apply customs duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of Council Regulation  (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988 laying down the arrangements to be applied by Spain and  Portugal to trade with Morocco (2) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying  down the arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and Algeria, Egypt and  Tunisia on the other (3); whereas the Community tariff quotas in question should therefore be  opened for 1991;\nWhereas by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2573/90\nof 5 September 1990 totally suspending certain  customs\nduties applicable by the Community of Ten to imports from Spain and Portugal (4) of the  products listed in Annex II to the Treaty, the said duties shall be totally suspended when they  reach a level of 2 % or less; whereas the same rates of duties should be applied to imports of  these products originating in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt;\nWhereas all Community importers should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said quotas  and the duty rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the  products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhaused; whereas the necessary  measures should be taken to provide for the effective Community management of the quotas, so that  the Member States may draw against the quotas such quantities as they may need, corresponding to  actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member  States and the Commission;\nWhereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of these quotas may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
