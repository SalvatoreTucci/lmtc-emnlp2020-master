However, they have stated that they are in the process of carrying out major work and putting into place working structures which will enable them to submit satisfactory data in one year's time.\n(7) The request by France should therefore be granted until 30 June 2003,", "main_body": ["Pursuant to Article 5(2) and Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002, France is granted a derogation until 30 June 2003 at the latest to bring its national statistical system into conformity with the said Regulation.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 January 2003.\nFor the Commission\nPedro Solbes Mira\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 179, 9.7.2002, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 310, 30.11.1996, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 286, 24.10.2002, p. 11."}
