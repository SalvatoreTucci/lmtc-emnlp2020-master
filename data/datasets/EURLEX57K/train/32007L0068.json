Those applications concern substances for which provisional exemptions were granted by Directive 2005/26/EC. On the basis of the EFSA opinions and other available information, it can be concluded that certain ingredients or substances derived from those ingredients listed in Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC are not likely, under specific circumstances, to cause adverse reactions in susceptible individuals.\n(5) Those ingredients or substances derived from those ingredients should therefore be permanently excluded from Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(6) Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(7) Directive 2005/26/EC should be repealed on 26 November 2007 in view of the deadline set by Article 6(11), second subparagraph of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(8) In order to avoid disruption of the market, it is necessary for this Directive to apply from the 26 November 2007.\n(9) It was expected that this Directive could be adopted and published well in advance of the date of 26 November 2007 in order to give time to the industry to adapt to the new rules. Since this has not been possible in practice, temporary measures appear therefore necessary to facilitate the application of the new rules. Indeed changes in labelling rules will affect industry, mainly small and medium enterprises, which need an adaptation period to smooth the transition towards new labelling requirements.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive as from 26 November 2007.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 May 2008 at the latest.
