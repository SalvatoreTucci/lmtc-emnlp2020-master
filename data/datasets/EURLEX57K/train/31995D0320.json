The task of the Committee shall be to supply the Commission with opinions at the  latter's request on any matter relating to the toxicological examination of chemicals for their  effects on health of workers.\nThe Committee shall in particular give advice on the setting of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs)  based on scientific data and where appropriate shall propose values which may include:\n-  the eight-hour time weighted average (TWA),\n-  short-term limits/excursion limits (STEL),\n-  biological limit values.\nThe OELs may be supplemented, as appropriate, by further notations.\nThe Committee shall advise on any absorption of the substance in question via other routes (such as  skin and/or mucous membranes) which is likely to occur.\n2.  Any recommendation shall be supported and explained by information on the basic data, a  description of the critical effects, the extrapolation techniques used, and any data on possible  risks to human health. The feasibility of monitoring exposure at any proposed limit value(s) shall  also be noted.\n3.  The Committee shall keep under review all relevant scientific factors relating to the setting  of OELs and shall make recommendations to assist the Commission in setting out priorities.\n4.  The Committee shall carry out such other actions relating to the toxicological evaluation of  chemical agents as may be requested by the Commission.", "1.  The Committee shall be composed of not more than 21 members drawn from all Member  States and reflecting the full range of scientific expertise which is necessary to fulfil the  mandate in Article 2, including, in particular, chemistry, toxicology, epidemiology, occupational  medicine and industrial hygiene, and general competence in setting OELs.\n2.  The Commission shall appoint the members of the Committee, after consulting the respective  Member States, having regard to the need to ensure that the various specific areas are covered.\n3.

The representatives of the Commission shall take part in the meetings of the Committee and the  working groups.", "The Committee and its working groups shall normally meet at the headquarters of the  Commission when they are convened by the latter. However, in exceptional circumstances and whenever  necessary in the light of scientific requirements, meetings may be held at places other than the  headquarters of the Commission when convened by the latter.", "1.  The deliberations of the Committee shall relate to the request for an opinion made  by the representatives of the Commission.\nThe representatives of the Commission, in requesting the opinion of the Committee, may fix the  length of time in which the opinion is to be given.\n2.
