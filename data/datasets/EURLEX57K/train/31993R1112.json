whereas these ceilings are set on  the basis of estimated Spanish and Portuguese production and consumption of the products in question in the beef and veal sector and a forward timetable for trade with the rest of the Community;\nWhereas Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 lays down that imports of these products into Portugal from Spain are subject to the supplementary trade mechanism in accordance with Articles 249 to 252 of the Act of Accession;\nWhereas Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3817/92 lays down that the issue of STM licences need not necessarily be subject to the lodging of a security; whereas that possibility was provided for, in particular, to facilitate trade in the products  concerned; whereas use should be made of that possibility to ensure that no security need be lodged when applications for the STM licences concerned are submitted;\nWhereas in order to regulate trade more satisfactorily by taking account of the varying levels of sensitivity of the Spanish and Portuguese markets at different times of the year, and in particular lower demand in the second and third quarters, the  annual quantities should be split up into two-month periods;\nWhereas, when laying down the detailed rules for the lodging of applications and the issuing of licences, derogations should be made both from Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the  application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2101/92 (8), and from Commission Regulation (EEC) No 574/86 of 28 February 1986 laying down  detailed rules for the application of the supplementary trade mechanism (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3296/88;\nWhereas in order to simplify the procedure for issuing STM licences an automatic system of issue should be laid down along with the introduction of a tighter notification system and a mechanism for monitoring the use of the licences issued;\nWhereas it should be laid down that Community traders may only export certain beef and veal products to Spain and Portugal under certain restrictive conditions regarding in particular the length of time they have been established in the trade;\nWhereas, with regard to imports into Portugal from third countries, certain aspects of the arrangements applicable to STM import licences laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 3817/92 should be clarified; whereas, for this purpose, the application of  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 of 4 September 1980 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3662/92 (11), and of the other  provisions regarding the various special import arrangements, is the most appropriate for the import arrangements for beef and veal;\nWhereas it is desirable, for the sake of clarity, to set out in a new Regulation the detailed rules for the application of the STM in respect of Spain and Portugal and to repeal Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3810/91 and (EEC) No 3829/92 (12);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
