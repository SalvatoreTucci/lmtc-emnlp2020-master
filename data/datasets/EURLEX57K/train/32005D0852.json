These large quantities of SALW and ammunition not only represent a huge surplus in terms\u2019 of Ukraine\u2019s current armed forces levels but also include large numbers of unserviceable and hazardous items of ammunition.\n(3) The EU-Ukraine Action Plan was adopted by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council on 21 February 2005 and calls upon both parties to jointly address threats for security, public health and environment, posed by Ukrainian stockpiles of old ammunition, inter alia, anti-personnel land mines.\n(4) The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), under the terms of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Trust Fund, is managing a twelve year project aimed at the destruction of 1,5 million surplus SALW and 133\u00a0000 tonnes of conventional ammunition to be executed in four phases.\n(5) The European Union considers that a financial contribution to the first phase of this project would help Ukraine to reduce the risks related to the accumulation of large quantities of SALW and ammunition and accommodate the level of SALW and ammunition to its current armed forces levels.\n(6) On 18 May 2005 the Parliament of Ukraine ratified the Convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction, (Ottawa Convention).\n(7) The European Union therefore intends to offer financial support to Ukraine in accordance with Title II of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP.
