This shall include those investment projects of which the major features may, in whole or in part, be subject to future review or to final authorization by a competent authority.\nThe following shall be considered as 'proposed withdrawals from service of installations or parts of installations`: installations or parts of installations with respect to which the decision has been taken in principle to withdraw them from service, this decision normally being expected to be put into effect within three years from the reference date, in the case of investment projects in the electricity and natural gas sector, or within one year in the case of investment projects in the petroleum sector.\nThe 'supplementary information` relating to investment projects shall include significant changes in the major features and decisional status of projects since the previous communication, and such other specific comments indicated by footnotes on the relevant questionnaire sheet.
