However, pursuant to Council Directive 71/285/EEC(3) they had established a system of tuberculin testing carried out by authorised veterinary surgeons outside the herd of origin both at approved dealers premises and assembly centres, during the 30 days prior to dispatch to other Member States.\n(4) Since 1 July 1999, the practice to carry out the tuberculin testing for certification purposes outside the herd of origin is no longer in line with Directive 64/432/EEC. It appears appropriate to allow under certain conditions until the surveillance network is approved in accordance with Article 17 and in any case for a transitional period of not more than two years, the tuberculin testing to be carried out during the 30 days prior to dispatch outside the herd of origin.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["1. Derogating from the provisions of Article 6(2)(a), first paragraph of Directive 64/432/EEC, Member States listed in the Annex may authorise the intradermal tuberculin test required for certification of bovine animals for intra-Community trade to be carried out outside the herd of origin.\n2. Member States using the derogation provided for in paragraph 1 shall ensure that bovine animals older than six weeks of age are only certified for intra-Community trade, if they fulfil the following conditions:\n- they come from herds officially free from bovine tuberculosis, and\n- they have reacted with a negative result as defined in Annex B point 32(d) of Directive 64/432/EEC to an intradermal tuberculin test, carried out during the 30 days period prior to certification.", "Member States using the procedures for tuberculin testing referred to in Article 1 shall ensure, that bovine animals for intra-Community trade so tested are accompanied by an animal health certificate as laid down in Annex F Model 1 of Directive 64/432/EEC amended as follows:\n1.
