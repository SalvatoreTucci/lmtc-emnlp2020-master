It also suggested that the Council, the Commission and the Member States consider implementing any possible measures to improve the combating of counterfeiting.\n(3) In its communication of 22 July 1998 to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Central Bank on the protection of the euro, the Commission said it would examine the possibility of launching a scheme for all those involved in the system for preventing, detecting and suppressing currency counterfeiting, which should allow guidelines to be determined for future planning.\n(4) On 28 June 2001 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting(5) which deals with exchanges of information, cooperation and mutual assistance, including external aspects of protection of the euro, and the withdrawal obligations incumbent on financial establishments. Its object is also to set up a comprehensive cooperation framework applicable before euro banknotes and coins are introduced in 2002. On the same day the Council also adopted Regulation (EC) No 1339/2001 extending the effects of Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency(6).\n(5) Consultations and experience show that a specific, multidisciplinary supplementary programme organised at Community level and carried out over the long term is likely to be more effective than measures conducted at national level. The two abovementioned Regulations should accordingly be supplemented by the adoption of an action programme, the aim of which is to raise the awareness of all the persons concerned with the protection of the euro against counterfeiting through the implementation of measures involving in particular the exchange of information and staff and technical and scientific back-up and training measures. This programme will support and complement the work done by Member States in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity provided for in Article 5 of the Treaty.\n(6) It should be ensured that this Community action programme, which is geared to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, is consistent with, and complementary to, other existing or future programmes and activities.\n(7) Without prejudice to the ECB's role in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, the Commission will carry out all consultations concerning the evaluation of needs for the protection of the euro with the principal parties involved (in particular the competent national authorities designated by the Member States, the ECB and Europol) within the appropriate advisory committee provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001, particularly as regards exchanges, assistance and training, for the purpose of implementing this programme.\n(8) The Community should promote cooperation with non-member countries in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.\n(9) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(7), will be included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as defined by the Treaty.\n(10) This Decision is without prejudice to initiatives which may be taken pursuant to the Treaty on European Union with a view to the establishment of programmes concerning aspects of criminal law,", "main_body": ["Establishment of the programme\n1.

The Community action programme shall, through the various measures provided for in Article 3, seek to protect the euro against counterfeiting.

Technical, scientific and operational back-up shall concern in particular:\n(a) any measure which establishes teaching resources at Community level (handbook of EU legislation, information bulletins, practical manuals, glossaries and lexicons, databases, especially in the area of scientific assistance or technology watch) or computer support applications (such as software);\n(b) studies with a multidisciplinary and transnational dimension; and\n(c) the development of technical support instruments and methods to facilitate detection activities at Community level.", "Target group for actions and contributions\n1.

In addition to the Commission's contribution, the following parties shall be invited to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the Community action programme using their respective areas of expertise:\n(a) the national central banks and the ECB, inter alia as regards the Counterfeit Monitoring System (CMS);\n(b) the National Analysis Centres (NAC) and the Coin National Analysis Centres (CNAC);\n(c) the European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC) and the national mints;\n(d) Europol and Interpol;\n(e) the national central anti-counterfeiting offices provided for in Article 12 of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency signed at Geneva on 20 April 1929(8) and other agencies specialising in the prevention, detection and law-enforcement in connection with counterfeiting;\n(f) specialist bodies concerned, for instance, by duplication and certification technologies, printers and engravers;\n(g) any other body offering specific expertise, including, where appropriate, third countries and in particular accession candidate countries.", "Consistency and complementarity\n1.

The Commission shall, in particular with an eye to sound financial management, seek to ensure consistency and complementarity between this Community action programme, geared to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, and other existing and future programmes and activities.", "Reference amount\nThe financial reference amount for the implementation of the Community programme of action for the period referred to in Article 1(2) is hereby set at EUR 4 million.\nThe annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective.", "International cooperation\nIn the light of the arrangements for distributing euro banknotes and coins, operational requirements, evaluation of the threat and risk analysis, the programme shall be open to the associated accession candidate countries, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the association agreements and the additional protocols thereto concerning participation in Community programmes concluded or to be concluded with those countries.\nIn addition, the programme shall, if necessary, be open to non-member countries in so far as appropriations are available in the Community budget, under conditions and in accordance with arrangements to be agreed with those countries.", "Financial provisions for workshops, meetings and seminars\n1. As regards the workshops, meetings and seminars provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) and organised by the Commission:\n(a) the following costs shall be borne by the Community:\n(i) the travel and accommodation expenses in another Member State of staff taking part and the general overheads associated with organising these events;\n(ii) publication and translation costs for the teaching materials used;\n(b) the following costs shall be borne by the Member States:\n(i) the costs associated with initial and continuing training of their staff, particularly as regards technical training;\n(ii) certain logistical costs in connection with the workshops, meetings and seminars organised on their territory with Community funding (such as internal transfers, rental of premises, provision of interpreting facilities).\n2.

The contribution of those partners may be a contribution in kind provided it is substantial. In any event, each partner shall bear the travel and accommodation costs of its own guest speakers.", "Financial provisions for staff exchanges\n1.
