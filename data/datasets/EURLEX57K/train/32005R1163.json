To ensure that analysis procedures in the Community are uniform, the descriptions of those methods must be allowed to stand in Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Article 44(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 shall apply to products covered by Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
