In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.\n(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2007 (1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007). On the basis of the data published by the United States\u2019 Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 33,38 million.\n(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has decreased, the last 30 products of the list in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be removed from the list in Annex I to that Regulation.\n(4) The effect of a 15\u00a0% ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 33,38 million.\n(5) To make sure that there are no delays in the customs clearance of goods removed from the scope of the 15\u00a0% ad valorem additional import duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on trade retaliation,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 110, 30.4.2005, p. 1.
