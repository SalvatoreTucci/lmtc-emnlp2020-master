Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health in the Union and therefore Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station\u00a0(2) was adopted.\n(3) On 14 June 2011, the Commission was informed of the finding of a high level of radioactive caesium in green tea leaves, originating in the Shizuoka prefecture. That was confirmed on 15 June 2011 by five other findings of high level of radioactive caesium in green tea leaves from Shizuoka prefecture. That prefecture is not among the prefectures of the affected zone, where a testing of all feed and food originating from those prefectures is required before export to the Union. Given these recent findings it is appropriate to add Shizuoka prefecture to the affected zone.\n(4) A significant number of samples taken by the Japanese authorities from food produced in Niigata and Yamagata prefectures show that the production of feed and food in those prefectures is only to a very limited extent affected by the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station as none of the samples had non-compliant levels of radioactivity, nearly all samples had non-detectable levels of radioactivity and only in few samples low levels of radioactivity were detected. Therefore, it is appropriate to remove those prefectures from the zone, where a testing of all feed and food originating from those prefectures is required before export to the Union.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 accordingly, whilst keeping the date of applicability of the Regulation unchanged.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 2, paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\n(a) the product has been harvested and/or processed before 11 March 2011, or\n(b) the product originates in and is consigned from a prefecture other than Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka, or\n(c) the product is consigned from Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures, but does not originate in one of those prefectures and has not been exposed to radioactivity during transiting, or\n(d) where a product originates in Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Miyagi, Nagano, Yamanashi, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizoka prefectures, the product does not contain levels of radionuclides iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the maximum levels provided for in Annex II to this Regulation. That provision applies also to products caught or harvested in the coastal waters of those prefectures, irrespective of where such products are landed.\n(2) Annex I is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 80, 26.3.2011, p. 5.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I"}
