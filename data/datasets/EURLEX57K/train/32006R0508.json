To solve this problem it should be allowed to switch products provided that they have an identical export refund rate and provided the exporter makes such request before completion of the export formalities.\n(4) Paragraph 4(a) of Article 20a reserves a part of the quota to those exporters who can prove that they have exported the products concerned during each of the three calendar years prior to the period for submission of applications. It appears, due to specific temporary circumstances in the Dominican Republic, that some traditional exporters have not been able to actually export in one of the reference years, although they can prove regularity in their export patterns. It is therefore appropriate to extend the reference period.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Article 20a of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is amended as follows:\n1. In paragraph 3, product code 0402\u00a010\u00a011\u00a09000 is inserted before code 0402\u00a010\u00a019\u00a09000;\n2.
