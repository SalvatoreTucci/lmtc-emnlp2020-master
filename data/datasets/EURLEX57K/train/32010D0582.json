By letter dated 17 December 2009 the Commission notified France and Italy that it had all the information necessary to consider the requests.\n(3) The Col de Tende Road Tunnel is a permanent road link between France and Italy. An agreement of 12 March 2007 between those two Member States has designated Italy as being responsible for the operation, maintenance and safety of the existing tunnel, as well as for the construction, operation, maintenance and safety of the new tunnel which, when completed, will carry traffic in the opposite direction to the existing tunnel.\n(4) Through the measure, the entire site of the existing tunnel, and the perimeter and construction site of the new tunnel, will be deemed to be on the territory of Italy for the purposes of supplies of goods, services, intra-Community acquisitions of goods and imports intended for the relevant construction, operation, maintenance and safety of the two tunnels. In the absence of such a measure, it would be necessary, according to the principle of territoriality, to ascertain for each supply whether the place of taxation was within France or Italy.\n(5) The purpose of the measure is therefore to simplify the procedure for charging value added tax on the operation, maintenance and safety of the existing tunnel, as well as the construction, operation, maintenance and safety of the new tunnel.\n(6) The derogation has no negative impact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 5 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the French Republic and the Italian Republic are authorised to consider the entire site of the existing Col de Tende Road Tunnel, along with the construction site of the new Col de Tende Road Tunnel which will run alongside the existing tunnel, as being on the territory of Italy for the purposes of supplies of goods, services, intra-Community acquisitions of goods and imports intended for the construction and subsequent operation, maintenance and safety of the new tunnel, as well as the operation, maintenance and safety of the existing tunnel.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic and the Italian Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 September 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.
