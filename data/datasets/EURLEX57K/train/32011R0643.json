Furthermore, the sources of information on the sorghum market are too few or too unreliable to provide a basis for setting import duties for this product. Lastly, it appears from the sources available that the prices of sorghum and of maize exported from the United States are very close to one another. Consequently, the representative cif import price calculated for maize should be applied to sorghum. Furthermore, the existing equality between the duties that apply to rye and those that apply to sorghum should be maintained.\n(3) Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 is amended as follows:\n1.
