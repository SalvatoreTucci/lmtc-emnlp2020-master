For sake of clarity, it is appropriate to fix the unit of measure to which the proposed price should refer to.\n(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 447/2010 lays down that the submission of the tenders in response to individual invitations to tender has to be made on the first and the third Tuesday of the month. The current dairy market situation allows reducing the number of individual invitations to tender to once per month.\n(3) Regulation (EU) No 447/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 447/2010 is amended as follows:\n(a) in Article 1 the following paragraph is added:\n(b) in Article 2, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 April 2011.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nNeelie KROES\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 126, 22.5.2010, p. 19."}
