 whereas, pending the entry into force of the Association Agreement concluded with the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the Community has decided to apply with effect from 1 March 1992 an interim agreement concluded with the aforesaid country,  hereinafter referred to as the 'Interim Agreement';\nWhereas the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic was dissolved with effect from 1 January 1993; whereas, as successor States to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic will continue to assume all obligations  arising from all agreements between the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the European Communities, and in particular from the Interim Agreement; whereas the said Interim Agreement was amended by Additional Protocols and by Supplementary Protocols  concluded with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic;\nWhereas, in view of the trade concessions provided for in the abovementioned Agreements with respect to agricultural products, a Community tariff quota for imports of bovine animals weighing between 160 and 300 kilograms originating in and coming from  Poland, Hungary, the Slovak Republic or the Czech Republic at a reduced 25 % levy should be opened for 1995;\nWhereas the Uruguay Round Agreements are due to apply from 1 July 1995; whereas the detailed rules for the application of this quota should be laid down and it should be opened until that date;\nWhereas half the reference quantity for 1995 laid down in the Association Agreements amounts to 138 600 head;

whereas this time limit should therefore be extended by one month as a transitional measure;\nWhereas, while recalling the provisions of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the product, the management of the system should be ensured through import licences; whereas, with that in mind, it would be appropriate to define, in  particular, the detailed rules for submission of applications, as well as the information which must be included on the applications and licences, notwithstanding certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying  down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2746/94 (8), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 of 4  September 1980 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1084/94 (10);
