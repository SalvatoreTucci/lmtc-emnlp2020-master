whereas the application of this treatment is limited until 30 June 1981;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3296/84 (2) provides for the treatment which the Community has applied until 31 December 1984 to be extended until 31 December 1985; whereas this treatment provides that certain wines having a designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Algeria shall be exempt from customs duties on importation into the Community within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 450 000 hectolitres; whereas the wines must be put up in containers holding a maximum of two litres; whereas these wines must be accompanied by a certificate of designation of origin in accordance with the model given in Annex D to the Agreement; whereas the Community tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1985;\nWhereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas, in order that such wines may benefit from this tariff quota, Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1208/84 (4), must be complied with;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for this quota to all imports of the products concerned into the Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect most accurately the actual development of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, assessed by reference to both the statistics relating to imports of the said products from Algeria over a representative reference period and the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;\nWhereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each of the types of wines in question are available and no reliable estimates of future imports can be made; whereas in these circumstances the quota volumes should be allocated in initial shares, taking into account demand for these wines on the markets of the various Member States;\nWhereas, to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve intended to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States who have used up their initial share; whereas, in order to guarantee some degree of security to importers in each Member State, the first instalment of the Community quota should be fixed at a level which could, in the present circumstances, be 50 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas the initial shares of the Member States may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to take this into account and to avoid a break in continuity, any Member State which has used up almost all of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this should be done by each Member State each time one of its additional shares is almost used up, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and\nthe Commission must be in a position to follow the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States thereof;\nWhereas, if at a given date in the quota period a substantial quantity of its initial share remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that it should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, to prevent part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
