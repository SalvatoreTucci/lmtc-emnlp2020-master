Products within those tariff quotas can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates. For the same reasons it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2010, for certain products new tariff quotas at a zero duty rate for an appropriate volume.\n(2) The quota volumes for autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order Nos\u00a009.2814,\u00a009.2816 and 09.2807 are insufficient to meet the needs of the Union\u00a0industry. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased.\n(3) The product description for the autonomous tariff quota of the Union with order No\u00a009.2907 should be revised.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) Since the tariff quotas provided for in this Regulation should take effect from\u00a01\u00a0July\u00a02010, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 is amended as follows:\n1. the rows set out in Annex I to this Regulation are added;\n2. the rows for the tariff quotas with order Nos 09.2814, 09.2907, 09.2816 and 09.2807 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 29 June 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
