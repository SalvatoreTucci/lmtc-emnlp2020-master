Forecasts of world market prices based on the New York's sugar futures exchange market for the terms of March, May and July 2011 further indicate a constant high world market price.\n(2) The cumulated negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar and isoglucose over the last two marketing years is estimated at 1,0 million tonnes, and would result in the lowest level of ending stocks in the EU since the implementation of the 2006 reform of the sugar sector. Any further shortfall of imports threatens to seriously disrupt the availability of supply on the Union sugar market and to further deteriorate in the absence of measures for the sector.\n(3) Exports from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to the European Union are not expected to increase in the short run.\n(4) On the other hand, a good harvest in some parts of the Union has led to the production of sugar in excess of the quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Part of this sugar should be made available to the sugar market of the Union in order to partially satisfy demand and to avoid excessive price increases. The available quantity of sugar in excess of the quota is estimated at 0,5 million tonnes. This estimate takes into account contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, and the quantities for which export licences have already been issued.\n(5) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota\u00a0(2) has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.\n(6) The extraordinarily low supply of sugar on the internal market in the 2010/2011 marketing year may allow the Commission to exceptionally fix the surplus levy at zero for a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, without any risk of accumulation of quantities.\n(7) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar. In order to preserve the balance between the two sweeteners, the appropriate quantity of out of quota isoglucose to be released on the internal market should be established on the basis of the relation of the quotas for each of the two products fixed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(8) Sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market.\n(9) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant's own available production, should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.\n(10) Applications should only be possible until the end of June and should only be valid for a short period of time. This should encourage a rapid availability of the quantities on the Union market.\n(11) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply.\n(12) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received.\n(13) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.\n(14) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether their application was fully or partially granted.\n(15) Account taken that the release on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates delivered is subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, it is appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne, for reasons of consistency, and to prevent abuse of the exceptional release of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose on the Union market during marketing year 2010/2011.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Temporary reduction of the surplus levy\nBy way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006, the amount of the surplus levy for a maximum quantity of 500\u00a0000 tonnes of sugar in white sugar equivalent and 26\u00a0000 tonnes of isoglucose in dry matter, produced in excess of the quota fixed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and released on the Union market in the marketing year 2010/2011, shall be fixed at EUR 0 per tonne.", "Application for certificates\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to benefit from the conditions specified in Article 1, sugar and isoglucose producers shall apply for a certificate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicants may be only undertakings producing beet and cane sugar or isoglucose, which are approved in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and have been allocated a production quota for the 2010/2011 marketing year, in accordance with Article 56 of that Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each applicant may submit one application for each product per week.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for certificates shall be submitted by fax or electronic mail to the competent authority in the Member State in which the undertaking was approved.
