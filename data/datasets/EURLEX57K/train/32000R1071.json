In view of the uncertainty as regards outlets, this is likely to induce operators to offer substantial quantities of maize and sorghum for intervention at the end of May in the north, although certain market outlets may be found after the end of the intervention period. This situation may be remedied by allowing those cereals to be bought in until 15 August 2000.\n(2) The conditions governing the buying-in of cereals are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 of 19 April 2000 establishing procedures for the taking-over of cereals by intervention agencies and laying down methods of analysis for determining the quality of cereals(3).\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
