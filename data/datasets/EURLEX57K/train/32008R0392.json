The reference to live weight at slaughter has also been deleted since this quality parameter duplicates the checked measurement of the carcase weight.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

The carcase weight ranges from 8 to 12,5 kg. Firm white fat, rectilinear profile with subconvex tendency and rounded contours. Meat tender, juicy, soft in texture, pale pink.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nAutonomous Community of Arag\u00f3n.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nThe meat covered by the PGI comes from holdings situated in the production area and registered with the Regulatory Board. Rearing, slaughter, cutting and packaging are supervised by the Regulatory Board. The meat is marketed with a guarantee certificate approved by the Regulatory Board.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe livestock comes from the \u2018Rasa Aragonesa\u2019, \u2018Ojinegra de Teruel\u2019 and \u2018Roya Bilbilitana\u2019 breeds. Slaughter, skinning and evisceration are carried out in accordance with the statutory methods. The carcases are left to air until the interior of the muscle tissue reaches an appropriate temperature for maturing and transportation. The carcases will be kept at a temperature of 3-4\u00a0\u00b0C for a period of under 24 hours and 1-3\u00a0\u00b0C for longer periods; they will be preserved for a period not exceeding six days.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nThe continental climatic conditions of this sparsely vegetated area (low rainfall, strong winds and major thermal variations) promote the development of three native breeds whose principal characteristic is their precocious growth. Since they attain an optimum degree of fat cover at an early age, they produce an exquisite meat which is appreciated for its quality.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Regulatory Board for the PGI \u2018Ternasco de Arag\u00f3n\u2019\nAddress : Ctra.
