The same also applies to the fishing industry.\n(4) The regions concerned are facing specific development problems, and in particular additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain products as a result of their remoteness.\n(5) With a view to maintaining the competitiveness of certain fishery products compared with that of similar products from other Community regions, the Community introduced measures in 1992 and 1993 to compensate for such additional costs in the fisheries sector. Those measures were then followed in 1994 and in the period 1995 to 1997 by the adoption of Regulations (EC) No 1503/94(6) and (EC) No 2337/95(7) and in the period 1998 to 2002 by the adoption of Regulations (EC) No 1587/98(8) and (EC) No 579/2002(9). From 2003 provision needs to be made for continuation of the scheme for offsetting the additional costs for certain fishery products as regards processing and marketing and, accordingly, measures should be adopted so that these measures may continue.\n(6) The non-industrial and inshore fishing industry is of social and economic importance in the outermost regions of the European Union.\n(7) For the sake of sound management of stocks fishing efforts must be rationalised, in particular in the light of the research of a high technical standard conducted in this area by various scientific institutions in the outermost regions.\n(8) The Community rules on the conservation and management of stocks must be observed in those regions, and in particular, in the case of the French department of Guiana, the rule prohibiting fishing for shrimp at a depth of less than 30 metres.\n(9) In order to promote the economic development of the outermost regions concerned, the Member States should be able to adjust the quantities and the Commission to adjust the amounts and quantities set for the various species from the same outermost region or between outermost regions of the same Member State, to take account of changes in marketing conditions and species' characteristics.\n(10) Where adjustment between species or within regions belonging to the same Member State has not led to full utilisation of the amounts available, the Commission should be able to adjust the amounts and quantities set for the various species between outermost regions of different Member States. In that event, adjustment should be without prejudice to the scale for allocating amounts available under this Regulation in subsequent years.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(10),", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThis Regulation introduces a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products listed in Annexes I to V from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and R\u00e9union (hereinafter referred to as \"the compensation\") as a result of those regions' remoteness.", "Recipients\nThe recipients of the compensation shall be the producers, the owners or operators of vessels registered in the ports of the regions referred to in Article 1 and operating therein or associations of such operators, and the operators in the processing and marketing sector or associations of such operators, who incur the additional costs in marketing the products concerned as a result of the remoteness of those regions.", "Azores\nIn the case of the Azores, the compensation shall be payable for the fishery products listed in Annex I.
