At the same time the possibility to associate representatives of other organisations should be provided for. Moreover, in accordance with the rules on the creation of Committees(2), the current Consumer Committee should be renamed \"European Consumer Consultative Group\".\n(4) It is further appropriate to increase the transparency and the efficiency of the operation of the Group, in particular by amending the procedure for the nomination of the candidates, making the term of office of members representing national consumer organisations renewable only once, putting in place effective reporting mechanisms and providing for the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Group.\n(5) Given the rather extensive nature of the amendments, Decision 2000/323/EC should be replaced for the sake of clarity,", "main_body": ["1.
