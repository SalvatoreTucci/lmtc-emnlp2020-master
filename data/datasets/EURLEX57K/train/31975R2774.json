whereas to this end the supply situation and prices for those products within the Community and the price situation on the world market must be taken into account;\nWhereas the difference between prices within the Community and prices on the world market for the quantity of feed grain required for the production of one kilogramme of eggs in shell and for the production of one egg for hatching must also be taken into account ; whereas in the case of the products specified in Article 1 (1) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 the coefficients referred to in Article 5 (2) of that Regulation should be taken into account;\nWhereas if price trends are to be noted prices must be determined in accordance with general principles ; whereas to this end prices on third country markets and in countries of destination, producer prices recorded in third countries and free-at-Community-frontier prices should be taken into account when prices on the world market are being determined ; whereas, in the absence of representative markets for egg products, prices ruling at the various marketing stages and on exportation should be used as a basis in determining Community prices;\nWhereas provision must be made for varying the amount of the refund according to the destination of the products, since markets in the countries of destination are at varying distances from Community markets and special conditions apply to imports in certain countries of destination;\nWhereas, to give Community exporters a measure of stability as regards the amount of the refund and certainty with regard to the list of products eligible for a refund, provision should be made for such list and amounts to remain valid for a relatively long period ; whereas rules should also be laid down for the advance fixing of export refunds;\nWhereas it is necessary to fix refunds in advance only in certain cases ; whereas any decision to do so should be taken in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75;\nWhereas the possibility of fixing refunds in advance makes it necessary to take steps to ensure that in each case exportation is carried out as stated in the application ; whereas to that end each applicant should receive a certificate requiring the products in question to be exported within a given period;\nWhereas in order to avoid abuse the issue of such certificates should be conditional upon the provision of security, which should be forfeit if the products are not exported within the period of validity of the certificate;\nWhereas experience gained in the various sectors where a common organization of the market has been established and in respect of which there is provision for advance fixing of the refund has shown that in certain circumstances, and in particular where exporters have abnormal recourse to this system, there is a risk of difficulties arising on the market in question;\nWhereas in order to remedy such a situation it must be possible for measures to be taken rapidly ; whereas provision should therefore be made for the Commission to adopt such measures after receiving the Opinion of the Management Committee or, in  (1)See page 49 of this Official Journal.\ncases of urgency, without waiting for the latter to meet;\nWhereas, to avoid distortions of competition between individual Community traders, the administrative conditions under which they operate must be identical throughout the Community ; whereas there does not appear to be any justification for granting a refund where the products in question are imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries ; whereas the reimbursement, under certain conditions, of the levy collected on importation is sufficient to allow these products to be placed on the world market again,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down rules for fixing and granting export refunds on the products specified in Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75.", "The following shall be taken into account when refunds are being fixed:    (a) the existing situation and the future trend with regard to:      - prices and availabilities of egg products on the Community market,\n- prices for egg products on the world market;\n(b) the need to avoid disturbances which might lead to a prolonged imbalance between supply and demand on the Community market ; and\n(c) the economic aspect of the proposed exports.\nWhen the refund on the products specified in Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 is being calculated, account shall also be taken of the difference between prices within the Community and prices on the world market for the quantity of feed grain determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 (1) of that Regulation, the coefficients referred to in Article 5 (2) of that Regulation also being taken into account in the case of derived products.", "1.

Where examination of the market situation shows that there are difficulties due to the application of the provisions concerning the advance fixing of the export refund, or that such difficulties may occur, a decision may be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) 2771/75 to suspend the application of these provisions for such period as is strictly necessary.\nIn cases of extreme urgency, the Commission may, after examination of the situation, decide on the basis of all the information available to it to suspend advance fixing for a maximum of three working days.\nApplications for certificates of advance fixing lodged during the period of suspension shall be rejected.", "1. The grant of the refund under the conditions provided for in Article 5 (3) shall be conditional on the presentation of a certificate of advance fixing, which shall be issued by Member States to any applicant irrespective of the place of his establishment in the Community.\nThe certificate of advance fixing shall be valid throughout the Community.\n2.
