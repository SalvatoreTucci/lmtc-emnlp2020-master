Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4:\n(a)  Member States may grant aid only through annual payments to beneficiaries without conditions  relating to its use; and (b)  aid may be granted only to agricultural holdings, the definition of such holdings being  established by the Member State concerned on the basis of objective criteria.\n2.  The amounts in ecu set in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1527/95 shall be converted into  national currency with the agricultural conversion rate valid immediately preceding the first  reduction in this rate covered by that Regulation.", "1.  The amount of aid granted to each beneficiary must be linked for farm size for a  period prior to 1 July 1995.\n2.  For the purpose of assessing farm size account shall be taken only of production for which the  reduction in agricultural conversion rate has had a significant impact.\nThe distribution of the total aid amount which may be granted shall reflect at a macro economic  level the proportional share of the loss of all sectors where this significant impact has  occurred.\n3.  Member States may set minimum farm sizes only to the extent necessary to facilitate  administration of the aid.\n4.  In all cases aid must be in conformity with the international commitments of the Community.", "When the total compensatory aid which is to be granted for any annual tranche divided  by the estimated number of agricultural holdings concerned is below ECU 400, aid for all  beneficiaries may be granted for the tranche concerned for measures concerning the agricultural  sector:\n-  of collective, general interest, and/or\n-  where Community provisions allow Member States to grant national aid, provided the intensities  under State aid policy are respected.\nThe introduction of the measures in question shall not exceed the duration of the three annual  tranches referred to in Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1527/95 and shall be completed within  six months of that period.\nTo be eligible for Community finance the measures must be additional either by their nature and/or  aid intensity to those that Member State would have applied in the absence of the aid and not to  benefit from other Community aid.", "1.  A request for authorization to grant aid must be made by a Member State to the  Commission by 30 June 1996. That request shall include information sufficient to enable the  Commission to verify the compatibility as required by paragraph 3.\n2.  A Member State intending to grant aid must adopt the national implementing measures within one  year from the date of the Commission decision, or of prior notice of the Member State, provided for  in paragraph 4.\n3.  The Commission, in conformity with the procedure laid down in Article 93 (3) of the Treaty and  in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, shall verify the compatibility of aid  requests with this Regulation and with Regulation (EC) No 1527/95.\n4.  The Commission shall decide whether to approve an aid within two months of receipt of the  request referred to in paragraph 1. If the Commission does not take a decision within that period,  the measures envisaged may be implemented provided the Member State has given prior notice to the  Commission of its intention so to act.", "1.  The Member State concerned shall submit to the Commission each year a report on  implementation of the aid measures giving details of amounts paid. The first such report shall be  submitted no later than 18 months after either the Commission decision or the Member State has  given due notice in conformity with Article 5 (4).\n2.  Aid schemes shall be reviewed by the Commission in the event of an increase in agricultural  conversion rates being introduced for the currency of the Member State concerned before the  beginning of the second or third successive 12 month tranches of aid are due to be granted. Taking  account of the impact of such devaluations on farm incomes the Commission, in accordance with the  procedure provided for in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92  (1), may decide that  successive aid tranches shall not be granted or their size shall be reduced.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 1995.\nFor the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission"}
