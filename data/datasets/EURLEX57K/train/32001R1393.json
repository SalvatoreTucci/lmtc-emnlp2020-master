The floods in certain areas of France in April and May 2001 have affected supplies of fodder and have made producers vulnerable to heavy losses of income by compelling them to sell their livestock if the normal feed cannot be provided. Temporary alternatives should therefore be offered by authorising the use of land set aside under the arable-crop scheme in duly justified cases having regard to objective criteria and on condition that at least 27 % of the forage area of the holding in question has been flooded, provisin nonetheless being made for measures to ensure that the land is not used for any lucrative purpose.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
