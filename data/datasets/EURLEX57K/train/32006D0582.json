No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(9) It is therefore concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain footwear with uppers of rubber or plastics (excluding waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or of plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes) or with uppers of leather or composition leather, having a protective toecap, falling within CN codes 6402\u00a030\u00a000, 6403\u00a040\u00a000, ex\u00a06402\u00a019\u00a000, ex\u00a06402\u00a091\u00a000, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a010, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a031, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a039, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a050, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a091, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a093, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a096, ex\u00a06402\u00a099\u00a098, ex\u00a06403\u00a019\u00a000, ex\u00a06403\u00a030\u00a000, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a011, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a015, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a019, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a091, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a095, ex\u00a06403\u00a051\u00a099, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a011, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a031, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a035, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a039, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a050, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a091, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a095, ex\u00a06403\u00a059\u00a099, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a011, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a013, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a016, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a018, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a091, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a093, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a096, ex\u00a06403\u00a091\u00a098, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a011, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a031, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a033, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a036, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a038, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a050, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a091, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a093, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a096, ex\u00a06403\u00a099\u00a098, ex\u00a06405\u00a010\u00a000, ex\u00a06405\u00a090\u00a010 and ex\u00a06405\u00a090\u00a090, originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India, is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 August 2006.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
