 whereas the European Council in February 1988 recognized that the recent adjustments to the common  agricultural policy create difficulties which were not foreseen and which necessitate an  amplification of the transitional arrangements, particularly as regards aid and timetables;\nWhereas the provision of aid which is temporary and reduced in phases, the initial amount of which  is determined on the basis of the income guaranteed to Portuguese producers at the end of the first  stage, would make it possible to reduce feedgrain prices in Portugal to the level of common prices  and thereby facilitate the integration of the Portuguese market into the common organization of the  markets;\nWhereas, in the case of durum wheat, the same result can be achieved by granting to Portuguese  producers the total aid provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on  the common organization of the market in cereals(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0  1340/90(3), which, under Article 323 of the Act of Accession, was to be progressively introduced as  from the beginning of the second stage;\nWhereas, in the case of common wheat, the difference between the price applicable in Portugal and  the common price is such that, in spite of the provision of aid, alignment cannot be achieved in  one single operation; whereas a price higher than the common price must therefore be set in respect of this product and its alignment on  the common price must be programmed over several marketing years;\nWhereas, in the case of rice, a product in respect of which the difference between Portuguese  prices and the common price does not warrant the provision of aid, a price based on that applicable  in Portugal at the end of the first stage should be applied at the beginning of the second stage  and this price subsequently aligned on the common price:\nWhereas, in the case of both common wheat and rice, the Community's recent policy makes unlikely  any alignment resulting from the development in common prices as stipulated in Article 285 (4) (a)  of the Act of Accession; whereas the method and timing of future alignments should therefore be  determined, with particular reference to the difference between the prices of such products and the  common prices;\nWhereas, as regards the phased reduction of aid, a system should be introduced enabling account to  be taken of variations in the buying-in price from one marketing year to the next and, in  particular, of reductions due to the stabilizers; whereas this phased reduction should also be  spread over a sufficiently long period and aligned on that envisaged for the alignment of common  wheat prices;\nWhereas, with regard to the provisions of aid, the length of the marketing year should be fixed  with reference to the season of the harvest in Portugal;\nWhereas the Community's interest in a rapid integration of the Portuguese cereals market into the  common organization of the market justifies a partial financing of the aid by the EAGGF, Guarantee  Section, the remainder being financed by Portugal;\nWhereas the application of common prices for the majority of cereals makes it appropriate to apply  to Portuguese producers the supplementary co-responsibility levy applicable to the other Member  States;\nWhereas, in order to ease the transition from the intervention system existing in Portugal prior to  the beginning of the second stage to the system based on the common organization of markets, it is  appropriate that, for the marketing year 1991/92, intervention in Portugal should take place from  the beginning of the marketing year and that triticale, an important cereal in the context of  Portuguese agriculture, should be eligible for intervention over a three-year period;\nWhereas, in view of the problems of the processing industry in Portugal, ten years is an  appropriate period for the progressive abolition of the measures intended to ensure the protection  of that industry as referred to in Article 286 (3) of the Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down the special transitional arrangements  applicable in Portugal in respect of the common organization of the markets in cereals and rice.\nI.
