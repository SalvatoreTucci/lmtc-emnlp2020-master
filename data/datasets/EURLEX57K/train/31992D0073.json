The planning of the measures for the development and rationalization of aquaculture production corresponding to the investments provided for in the Annex hereto shall be carried out with due regard for the priorities set by the various  Regulations governing the Community structural policies.\n2. Special attention must be given during the implementation of the programme to the interaction between the development of the aquaculture sector and the environment and to the health conditions of fish farms and their products.\n3. Preference shall be given to investment projects to which the Member State applies rules favourable to the development of aquaculture and protected marine areas.\n4. Preference shall be given to innovative projects based on adequate research work and ensuring in the long term the diversification of production.\n5. The production objectives of the programme must be checked at regular intervals and adjusted, if necessary, in line with the development of the market for fishery and aquaculture products.", "The Commission shall inform the Member State, if necessary, within six months following 1 April each year, of the failure to comply with the conditions to which approval of the programme was made subject, on the basis of an examination of the  periodic summary reports provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86, or in the absence thereof.", "The Commission draws attention to the fact that the investment estimates contained in this programme are without prejudice to any financial aid the Community may grant.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 1991.

Other coastal areas.\nFresh water aquaculture (within Portugal and Madeira).\nAreas set aside for the development of aquaculture, especially in the southern part of the country.\nEnvironment\nInstallation of sanitation networks in estuaries and lagoons (ERDF).\nSystematic monitoring of health measures applied in conjunction with the establishment of intensive and semi-intensive systems.\nResearch\nImprovement of farming techniques.\nThe interaction between aquaculture and the environment is to be examined by means of impact studies.\nConstruction of several pilot units.\nDiseases\nDisease prevention (especially in the case of carpet shells). Investments in infrastructure (water circulation systems, recovery of sea-bottoms, restocking using disease-free seed).\nLegislative aspects/funding of investments\nOverall investment for the programme for 1992 to 1996: approximately ECU 187 million.\nMarket\nStimulation of supply, the local market being under-supplied with quality fish (the bulk being earmarked for export). This would help keep down inflation.\nPriorities/objectives\nThe main objective is to expand aquaculture production, quantitatively and qualitatively, on land and at sea, by:\n- developing areas suitable for aquaculture,\n- increasing collective structural investments,\n- promoting investments in new production techniques (e.g. offshore),\n- reclaiming areas that have been abandoned by means of integrated projects,\n- providing vocational training for aquaculture farmers with the aim of achieving improved technical and economic viability of enterprises,\n- developing hatchery units for fish and initial on-growing units for spat in the case of molluscs (carpet shells, mainly),\n- improving and expanding semi-intensive and intensive production systems,\n- monitoring, treating and preventing disease.\nMULTIANNUAL GUIDANCE PROGRAMME - PROTECTED MARINE AREAS PORTUGAL\nRegions/locations\nThe Portuguese coastline.\nEnvironment\nEvaluation of the impact of artificial reefs on the Algarve coast.\nLegislative aspects/funding of investments\nInstallation of several artificial reefs representing a total foreseen investment of ECU 5,7 million."}
