The majority would go on investment in new plant and machinery - some of it replacement investment - to boost the quality of the firm's products.\nThe Commission opened the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the plan and, by letter dated 28 January 1983, gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments.\nThe Commission felt that the planned award did not fulfil the requirements of the industry aid scheme, which had been approved by the Commission on 18 November 1981 and had been in operation since 1 January 1982.\nII\nThe Belgian Government did not reply to the Commission's letter of formal notice or supply any other information after the opening of the Article 93 (2) procedure.\nThree other Member States and two trade associations replied to the Commission's invitation to comment. They pointed out, in particular, that Belgian carpet exports to other EEC countries were on the increase and that any aid given to a firm in the industry, which was already highly competitive, would have an immediate effect on competition.\nIII\nThe proposed aid award is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty by favouring the firm in question or production of its type of goods.\nArticle 92 (1) lays down the general principle that aid having the features there described is incompatible with the common market. The exceptions from this principle defined in Article 92 (3) specify objectives in the Community interest transcending the interests of the aid recipient. These exceptions must be construed strictly when any regional or industry aid scheme or any individual award under a general aid scheme is scrutinized. In particular, they may be applied only when the Commission is satisfied that the free play of market forces alone, without the aid, would not induce the prospective aid recipient to adopt a course of action contributing to attainment of one of the said objectives.\nTo apply the exceptions to cases not involving such a general benefit in return for the individual benefit conferred by the aid would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.\nIn applying these principles in its scrutiny of individual awards under general aid schemes, the Commission must satisfy itself that the recipient is contributing a compensating benefit justifying the aid, in the sense that the aid is necessary in order to help achieve one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3). Where this cannot be demonstrated, and especially where the investment would be carried out in any case, it is clear that the aid would not contribute to attainment of the objectives specified in the exceptions but would merely serve to bolster the financial position of the recipient.\nThe recipient in the present case cannot be said to be contributing such a compensating benefit.\nThe Belgian Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the planned aid falls within one of the categories of exceptions in Article 92 (3).\nWith regard to the exceptions granted by points (a) and (c) of Article 92 (3) for aids that promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, the prospective recipient is not located in an area where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious unemployment within the meaning of point (a) and the award does not appear likely to facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of point (c).\nAs far as the exceptions in point (b) are concerned, the investment project does not have the features of a project of common European interest or of a project likely to remedy a serious disturbance in economy of a Member State, as would be required for these exceptions to be applicable.\nThe Belgian textile and clothing industry aid scheme was approved by the Commission on 18 November 1981. Since its introduction, Belgian firms in the industry have been barred from aid under any other specific, regional or general scheme.\nTo qualify for application of the exception in Article 92 (3) (c), individual aid awards under this scheme must meet all the requirements of the scheme as approved by the Commission. These include the requirement, especially where the prospective recipient belongs to a sector of the industry that is sensitive or competitive, that the recipient be undertaking restructuring to regain viability or be cutting excess capacity with the help of the aid.\nThe Belgian Government has been unable to demonstrate, or the Commission to confirm, that the proposed award meets all the requirements within the context of the Belgian industry aid scheme which would qualify it for application of the exception in Article 92 (3) (c).\nSome 75 % of the investment to be undertaken by the firm under its modernization programme will be for improving its production facilities and would normally be borne by the firm itself. The information available to the Commission as to recent trade trends for carpets and floor coverings indicates a marked, steady increase in exports from Belgium to the other Member States. In 1982 this growth was of the order of 10 %. Belgian firms in this sector export around 90 % of their output, two-thirds of it to other EEC countries.\nThe prospective aid recipient will increase its output of tufted carpet by about 4 %. A large proportion of this output is sold in the Community: 21,3 % in Belgium and 55,4 % in other Member States. Hence, the planned award will clearly affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.\nThe firm's programme does not therefore fulfil the conditions of the industry aid scheme in force in Belgium justifying the grant of aid, especially in view of the extremely competitive position of the carpet and floor-coverings sector.\nIn view of the above, the aid that the Belgian Government plans to award to this firm does not fulfil the conditions necessary for application of one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,", "main_body": ["The Belgian Government shall not proceed with the award of aid to undertaking No 156 in the carpet and floor-coverings sector.", "The Belgian Government shall inform the Commission, within two months of the notification of this Decision, of the measures it has taken to comply therewith.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 July 1983.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nMember of the Commission"}
