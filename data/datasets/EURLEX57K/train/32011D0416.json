The programmes were found to comply with relevant Union veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Decision 2008/341/EC.\n(8) The amended programmes submitted by Spain, Poland, Slovakia and Finland should therefore be approved.\n(9) Decision 2010/712/EU provides for a financial contribution from the Union for Slovakia for those oral vaccination activities included in the annual programme for the eradication of rabies in that Member State that are implemented in bordering areas of neighbouring third countries. In addition, that Decision provides for a financial contribution from the Union for Lithuania for those oral vaccination activities included in the multiannual programme for the eradication of rabies in that Member State that are implemented in bordering areas of neighbouring third countries.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to also provide for a financial contribution from the Union for those parts of the programmes for the eradication of rabies in Poland and Finland that are implemented in bordering areas of neighboring third countries adjacent to the Union.\n(11) The approval by this Decision of the amended programmes for the eradication of rabies submitted by Poland and Finland has an impact on the amounts needed for carrying out the programmes for those Member States as approved under Decision 2010/712/EU. The maximum amount of Union financial contribution for the programmes for the eradication of rabies in Poland and Finland, laid down in that Decision, should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\n(12) Decision 2010/712/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The amended programme for the monitoring and eradication of bluetongue submitted by Spain on 1 February 2011 is hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.", "The amended programmes for the eradication of rabies submitted by Poland on 5 April 2011, by Slovakia on 13 December 2010 and by Finland on 12 April 2011 are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.", "Article 10 of Decision 2010/712/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in paragraph 2, point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) shall not exceed the following:\n(i) EUR\u00a01\u00a0800\u00a0000 for Bulgaria;\n(ii) EUR\u00a0620\u00a0000 for Estonia;\n(iii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0450\u00a0000 for Hungary;\n(iv) EUR\u00a07\u00a0110\u00a0000 for Poland;\n(v) EUR\u00a05\u00a0000\u00a0000 for Romania;\n(vi) EUR\u00a0700\u00a0000 for Slovakia;\n(vii) EUR\u00a0200\u00a0000 for Finland.\u2019;\n(2) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n(a) be granted only for the costs of the purchase and of the distribution of oral vaccine plus baits;\n(b) be at the rate of 100\u00a0%; and\n(c) not exceed:\n(i) EUR\u00a0630\u00a0000 for Poland;\n(ii) EUR\u00a0250\u00a0000 for Slovakia;\n(iii) EUR\u00a065\u00a0000 for Finland.\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 29.4.2008, p. 44.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 25.11.2010, p. 18."}
