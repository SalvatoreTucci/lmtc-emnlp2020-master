The application was lodged by South Asian Petrochem Limited (the applicant), an exporting producer in India (the country concerned).\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(2) The product under review is polyethylene terephthalate with a coefficient of viscosity of 78\u00a0ml/g or higher, according to DIN (Deutsche Industrienorm) 53728, originating in India (the product concerned) and normally declared within CN code 3907\u00a060\u00a020. This CN code is given only for information.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) The measures currently in force are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000\u00a0(2), under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating, inter alia, in India and produced by the applicant are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR\u00a0181,7 a tonne with the exception of imports from several companies expressly mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product concerned which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures.\n(5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.\n(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant\u2019s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(8) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duties in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant\u2019s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(9) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 7(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation, or\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON COOPERATION\n(10) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(11) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated,", "main_body": ["A review of Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000 is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 in order to determine if and to what extent the imports of polyethylene terephthalate with a coefficient of viscosity of 78\u00a0ml/g or higher, according to DIN (Deutsche Industrienorm) 53728, falling within CN code 3907\u00a060\u00a020 originating in India, produced and sold for export to the Community by South Asian Petrochem Limited (TARIC additional code A585) should be subject to the anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000", "The anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000 is hereby repealed with regard to the imports identified in Article 1 of the present Regulation.", "The customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.
