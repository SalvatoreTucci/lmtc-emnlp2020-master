However, consultations between the two parties have led to mutual clarifications. It is therefore appropriate to grant the request partially and to release the remainder of the exceptional flexibilities as soon as India amends its notification to the WTO for those tariff lines for which India has announced that it will introduce maximum customs duties.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textiles Management Committee provided for in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93,", "main_body": ["Transfers between the quantitative limits for textile goods originating in the Republic of India are authorised for the quota year 2000 as detailed in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 October 2000.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 275, 8.11.1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 34.\n(3) OJ L 153, 27.6.1996, p. 53.\nANNEX\n>TABLE>"}
