Decision 93/402/EEC has been repealed by Decision 2004/212/EC\u00a0(7) and its provisions have been incorporated in Decision 79/542/EEC.\n(3) The outbreak has been closed for more than 12 months and no new outbreaks have been detected in the territory of Argentina. In the meantime, inspection missions carried out in 2004 have shown that the situation in Argentina has improved in regard to both animal and public health.\n(4) The Commission requested Argentina to provide for a buffer zone along its borders with Bolivia and Paraguay in order to avoid the risk of introduction of FMD. Argentina proposed a zone with a width of 25 kilometres along its border with those countries (\u2018the buffer zone\u2019). Detailed maps and information, in particular concerning control measures in place in the buffer zone, have now been provided to the Commission. Importation into the Community from the buffer zone of fresh meat from species susceptible to FMD should be prohibited.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to resume importation of deboned and matured bovine fresh meat from the provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chaco and Formosa with the exception of the buffer zone.\n(6) Decision 79/542/EEC has been amended by Decision 2004/212/EC inter alia in order to exclude meat products from its scope. It is therefore appropriate to delete in Article 1 the erroneous reference to meat products.\n(7) Article 1 and Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 to Decision 79/542/EEC the words \u2018and meat products\u2019 are deleted.", "Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 18 March 2005.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.
