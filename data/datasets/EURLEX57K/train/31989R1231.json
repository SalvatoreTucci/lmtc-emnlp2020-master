The second subparagraph of Article 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u00c2\u00b4However, at the first purchaser's request, aid may be advanced following identification of the seed provided that security is lodged for an amount equivalent to that advanced.'\n2.  Article 4 is replaced by the following Articles:\n\u00c2\u00b4Article 4\n1.  For the purposes of this Regulation, \"identification'' shall mean the act whereby the competent agency of the Member State certifies, on application by the interested party, that the aid to be granted for the quantity of soya beans covered by the  application shall be that applicable on the day when the application was lodged.\nHowever, the amount of aid applicable on the day on which the application for the advance-fixing part of the certificate referred to in Article 4a was lodged, adjusted in accordance with Article 4d, shall be applied at the interested party's request to  beans identified during the period of validity of the advance-fixing part of the certificate.\nIdentification of the beans shall be carried out once they enter into the processing undertaking but before they are processed.\n2.  On request by the interested party, the Member State shall identify the beans.\n3.  However, in the case indicated in Article 2 (2), identification of the beans shall, up to 31 December 1992, be carried out following their entry into the store of the approved non-processing first purchaser and before their delivery to the  processor.\n4.  The application for identification must relate to the entire quantity received under cover of one or more delivery declarations, signed by both the producer and the first purchaser, referring to one or more contracts. The application for  identification must be lodged after deposit of the said contracts and declarations. If the application is lodged by:\n(a)  a first purchaser processing the beans, he shall be under an obligation to process the indicated production or quantity within a time limit to be determined;\n(b)  a first purchaser other than the processor, he shall be under an obligation to deliver or sell the indicated quantity to a processor within a time limit to be determined.", "a\nA two-part Community certificate shall be introduced, one part to provide evidence that beans harvested in the Community have been identified and the other to certify, if appropriate, that the aid has been fixed in advance. Both parts of the certificate  shall be issued by the Member State to any interested party who requests them and who fulfils the conditions specified in Article 2.", "b\nSave as otherwise provided in Article 4d, the advance-fixing part of the certificate referred to in Article 4a shall be issued on the afternoon of the first working day following that on which the application was lodged.\nThe issuing of the advance-fixing part of the certificate shall be conditional on the lodging of security against an application for identification of the beans during the period of validity of that part of the certificate. The security shall be wholly  or partly forfeit if, during that period, the application for identification is not made or is made for only part of the quantity concerned.", "c\n1.  Where the aid is fixed in advance, the amount of aid applicable on the day on which the application is lodged shall be adjusted in line with:\n(a)  the difference between the guide price valid on that day and that valid on the day on which the beans are identified, and\n(b)  if necessary, a corrective amount.\n2.  The corrective amount indicated at (b) in paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with the trend of soya bean prices on the world market.\n3.  If prices on the forward world market cannot be determined, the corrective amount shall be fixed for the month or months in question at a level such that the aid is nil.", "d\n1.  If, owing to an abnormal situation on the Community soya bean market, the normal disposal of products harvested in the Community is disturbed or is likely to be disturbed, a decision may be taken, covering cases where the advance-fixing part of the  certificate has not yet been issued, to suspend advance fixing of the aid for the period required for market balance to be restored.\n2.  The decision to suspend advance fixing shall be taken using the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC.\nHowever, in cases of emergency, the Commission may itself decide to suspend advance fixing; in such cases the period of suspension may not exceed seven days.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 1989.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 1989.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
