Provisions should also be made for altering the arrangements governing access to the markets for products originating in the ACP States referred to in Annex V to the Cotonou Agreement, particularly in the light of the said departments' economic development requirements.\n(8) Although the tariff advantages resulting from Annex V to the Cotonou Agreement are calculated on the basis of rates laid down in the Common Customs Tariff, and in accordance with the rules governing it, they should be calculated on the basis of the autonomous duty where, for the products concerned, that duty is lower than the conventional duty.\n(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(3).\n(10) It should be stipulated that the rules on safeguard measures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2285/2002 on the safeguard measures provided for in the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 3705/90(4) apply to the products covered by this Regulation.\n(11) Since this Regulation is to replace Council Regulation (EC) No 1706/98 of 20 July 1998 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 715/90(5), that Regulation should be repealed.\n(12) As this Regulation implements international commitments, which the Community has already made, the Regulation enters into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities,", "main_body": ["Scope\n1.
