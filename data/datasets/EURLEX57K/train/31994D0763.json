Unless otherwise provided in the relevant specific programme decision, participation by international organizations and legal entities from third countries under this Article shall not benefit from Community financing under the framework programme.\nHowever, in duly specified cases, the participation of international research organizations situated in Europe may receive financial support from the Community.\n4.  Certain preparatory, accompanying and support measures for RTD indirect actions may exceptionally be conducted, with financial support from the Community, by legal entities from any State or by international organizations, provided this is in the  interest of Community policies.", "1.

For shared cost actions with legal entities, 'additional costs' shall include only:\n(i) direct costs incurred for the activity and to which the legal entity is not otherwise committed;\n(ii) an appropriate contribution to indirect overhead costs.\n'Additional costs' shall be used by legal entities for RTD projects where, in the view of the Commission, the analytical budget accountancy used by the legal entity does not enable the full costs of the activity to be substantiated with sufficient  precision.", "1.  For technology stimulation purposes, small and medium-sized enterprises established in the Community or a State associated with the programme may:\n(a) where they have similar technical problems but do not have adequate own-research facilities, participate in 'cooperative research' activities enabling them to engage other legal entities to carry out RTD on their behalf;\n(b) be provided with support, including via networks for decentralized assistance, for the search for partners and for the preparation of outline proposals.

Following an initial call, proposals for 'cooperative research' and outline proposals for such exploratory phase work may be submitted at any time.", "To the extent necessary for fulfilling objectives or measures specific to a programme, and in particular in the case of the activities referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Article 130g of the Treaty, the rules in this Decision may be  set out in more detail, supplemented or be subjected to conditions or limitations in the decision adopting the specific programme.", "0\n1.
