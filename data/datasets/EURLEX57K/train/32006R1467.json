Therefore the British Virgin Islands should be included in the list set out in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003.\n(5) In the interest of clarity of Community legislation, the list of countries and territories set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should be replaced in its entirety.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 October 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.
