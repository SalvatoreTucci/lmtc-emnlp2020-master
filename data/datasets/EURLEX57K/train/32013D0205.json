The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 15 March 2005 (acequinocyl), on 10 September 2007 (ascorbic acid), on 22 August 2006 (aminopyralid), on 1 September 2008 (flubendiamide), on 13 September 2012 (gamma-cyhalothrin), on 29 May 2008 (ipconazole), on 15 April 2008 (metaflumizone), on 19 July 2012 (orthosulfamuron), on 3 November 2009 (Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134), on 13 January 2009 (pyridalil), on 20 March 2008 (pyroxsulam), on 9 March 2004 (spiromesifen), on 17 December 2008 (thiencarbazone) and on 26 July 2007 (topramezone).\n(18) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC, read in conjunction with Commission Implementing Decisions 2011/490/EU\u00a0(17) (acequinocyl, aminopyralid, flubendiamide, metaflumizone, pyroxsulam and thiencarbazone), 2011/252/EU\u00a0(18) (ascorbic acid, ipconazole, Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134, spiromesifen and topramezone) and 2011/671/EU\u00a0(19) (gamma-cyhalothrin).\n(19) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on a possible approval in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 for acequinocyl, aminopyralid, ascorbic acid, flubendiamide, gamma-cyhalothrin, ipconazole, metaflumizone, orthosulfamuron, Pseudomonas sp.
