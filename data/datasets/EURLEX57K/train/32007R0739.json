However, the marketing year 2006/2007 begins on 1 July 2006 and ends on 30 September 2007. Consequently, unlike a normal marketing year, it extends over 15 months rather than 12 months.\n(2) In view of the length of the marketing year 2006/2007, Article 9(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2006\u00a0(2) provides for a transitional isoglucose quota so as to ensure an allocation which corresponds to that of the preceding marketing year.\n(3) A number of Member States allocate sugar quotas to undertakings specialising in the production of sugar by extraction from molasses. As in the case of isoglucose, this involves consistent levels of production throughout a given marketing year. However, in accordance with Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, the quantity allocated for the marketing year 2006/2007 is equal to the quantity allocated for the marketing year 2005/2006. In the interests of fairness to the isoglucose producers, these undertakings, too, should be allocated a transitional quota taking into account the length of the marketing year 2006/2007.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 493/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following paragraph 3a is inserted:\n2. in paragraph 4, the introductory words are replaced by the following:\n3. paragraph 6 is replaced by the following paragraphs 6 and 7:\n(a) before 15 July 2006, a breakdown by undertaking of the transitional quotas allocated under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3;\n(b) before 30 June 2007, a breakdown by undertaking of the transitional quotas allocated under paragraph 3a.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
