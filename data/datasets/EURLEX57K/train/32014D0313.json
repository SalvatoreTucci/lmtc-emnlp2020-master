In accordance with Article 6(7) of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010, for specific categories of goods containing those substances, where it is not technically feasible to substitute those goods as such or via the use of alternative materials or designs, or in the case of products which have a significantly higher overall environmental performance compared with other goods of the same category, the Commission may adopt measures to grant derogations from Article\u00a06(6)\u00a0of that Regulation.\n(2) Commission Decisions 2011/263/EU\u00a0(4), 2011/264/EU\u00a0(5), 2011/382/EU\u00a0(6), 2011/383/EU\u00a0(7), 2012/720/EU\u00a0(8) and 2012/721/EU\u00a0(9) established the ecological criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents. Subsequent to the adoption of those Decisions, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 was amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 286/2011\u00a0(10). The amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 became applicable in respect of substances from 1 December 2012 and will become applicable in respect of mixtures from 1 June 2015. Regulation (EU) No 286/2011 added new classification criteria for long-term aquatic hazard based on chronic aquatic toxicity and biodegradability data. On the basis of the new criteria, the majority of readily-degradable surfactants currently used in detergents and cleaning products has become classified as Chronic category 3 (H412) and in some cases, specifically relevant to hand dishwashing detergents, as Chronic category 2 (H411), and therefore are banned from use in products bearing the EU Ecolabel. This would make it difficult for the established ecological criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents to correspond indicatively to the best 10-20 % of detergents and cleaning products available on the Union market in terms of environmental performance throughout their life-cycle, as there is no evidence that alternative surfactants are available. Assessment and verification text is updated, in order to provide guidance to help applicants to prove compliance with the new requirement.\n(3) The consequences of introduction of new classification criteria were not known during the review of the criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners set out in Decisions 2011/263/EU, 2011/264/EU, 2011/382/EU and 2011/383/EU and during the development of criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents and the considerations of derogations for surfactants set out in Decisions 2012/720/EU and 2012/721/EU.\n(4) This amendment is applied retroactively from 1 December 2012, in order to ensure continuity of the validity of EU Ecolabel criteria for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents.\n(5) Decisions 2011/263/EU, 2011/264/EU, 2011/382/EU, 2011/383/EU, 2012/720/EU and 2012/721/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the
