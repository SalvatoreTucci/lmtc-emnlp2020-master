DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThese standards shall apply to fresh cut flowers and flowers buds of a kind suitable for bouquets or for ornamental purposes, falling within subheading No 06.03 A of the Common Customs Tariff.\nII. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Minimum requirements\nProduce must have been carefully cut or picked, according to the species, and have reached an appropriate stage of growth.\nB. Classification\n(i) Class I\nProduce in this class must be of good quality. It must have the characteristics of the species and, where appropriate, of the variety (cultivar).\nAll parts of the cut flowers must be:\n- whole,\n- fresh,\n- free of animal or vegetable parasites and from damage caused by such,\n- free of residues of pesticides and other extraneous matter affecting the appearance,\n- unbruised,\n- free of defects of development; for carnations a split calyx is not considered a defect of development.\nHowever, in respect of American carnations, flowers with a split calyx must be ringed, put up separately in uniform lots and the packages marked accordingly.\nThe stems must, according to species and variety (cultivar) be rigid and strong enough to support the flower(s).\n(ii) Class II\nThis class shall include all produce which does not meet all the requirements of Class I.\nAll parts of the cut flowers must be:\n- whole,\n- fresh,\n- free of animal parasites.\nThe flowers may, however, have the following defects:\n- slight malformation,\n- slight bruising,\n- slight damage caused, for example, by disease or by animal parasites,\n- weaker, less rigid stems,\n- small marks caused by treatment with pesticides.\nThe permitted defects must not impair the keeping quality, appearance or utility of the products.\nC. Extra Class\nProduce which qualifies for Class I without the aid of any quality tolerance may be marked EXTRA. However, this classification may not be used for American carnations with a split calyx.\nIII. SPECIAL PROVISIONS\nThe special provisions for certain types of flowers set out in Annex I A shall override the provisions of this Annex.\nIV. SIZING\nFor cut flowers, sizing must comply at least with the following scale:\nCode | Length |\n0 | less than 5 centimetres or flowers marketed without stems |\n5 | 5\u2014 10 centimetres |\n10 | 10\u2014 15 centimetres |\n15 | 15\u2014 20 centimetres |\n20 | 20\u2014 30 centimetres |\n30 | 30\u2014 40 centimetres |\n40 | 40\u2014 50 centimetres |\n50 | 50\u2014 60 centimetres |\n60 | 60\u2014 80 centimetres |\n80 | 80\u2014100 centimetres |\n100 | 100\u2014120 centimetres |\n120 | more than 120 centimetres |\nThese lengths include the flower head.\nThe difference per unit of presentation (bunch, bouquet, box and the like) between the maximum and minimum lengths of the flowers in the unit may not exceed:\n- 2\u00b75 centimetres for flowers in codes 15 and below,\n- 5\u00b70 centimetres for flowers in codes 20 (inclusive) to 50 (inclusive),\n- 10\u00b70 centimetres for flowers in codes 60 and above.\nThis difference may be doubled for flowers presented in fan shape. For chrysanthemums with large flowers presented in fan shape this difference may go up to 20 centimetres for flowers in codes 20 to 50 (inclusive).\nThe size scale and the uniform lengths set out above are not applicable to mimosa.\nThe minimum length for branches of mimosa shall be fixed at 20 centimetres. However, bundles and bouquets composed exclusively of small sprigs of a length less than 20 centimetres may be permitted subject to the words \"short stem\" or an equivalent term being marked on the packages.\nV. QUALITY TOLERANCES\nQuality tolerances shall be permitted in each unit of presentation as follows:\n(i) Class I\n5 % of the cut flowers may have slight defects, on condition that the uniformity of the flowers in a unit of presentation is not affected.\n(ii) Class II\n10 % of the cut flowers may vary from the requirements of the class. Half of this percentage may have been attacked by parasites of animal or vegetable origin.\nThe defects in question must not impair the utility of the products.\nVI. PACKAGING AND PRESENTATION\nA. Presentation\nA unit of presentation (bunch, bouquet, box and the like), must consist of 5, 10 or a multiple of 10 pieces.
