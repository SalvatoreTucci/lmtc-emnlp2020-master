On that date the rules regarding the buying-in and the sales of products for and from intervention, including new rules regarding the costs to be borne by intervention agencies and operators, as established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 of 11 December 2009 laying down common detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards buying-in and selling of agricultural products under public intervention\u00a0(3) became applicable for the dairy sector.\n(3) In order to take account of this situation regarding sales, Commission Regulation (EU) No 569/2010 of 29 June 2010 derogating from Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 as regards sales by tender of butter and skimmed milk powder provided for respectively by Regulation (EU) No 446/2010 and Regulation (EU) No 447/2010\u00a0(4) introduced a derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 on the relevant rules for the sales by tender of butter and skimmed milk powder for tenders submitted until 21 September 2010.\n(4) In order to provide time for the further examination of the uniform application of the rules regarding the costs to be borne by the intervention agencies and operators regarding the buying-in and the sale of butter and skimmed milk powder for and from intervention, the derogation introduced by Regulation (EU) No 569/2010 was extended until the end of the 2011 accounting year by Commission Regulation (EU) No 826/2010 of 20\u00a0September 2010 derogating from Regulation (EU) No\u00a01272/2009 as regards buying-in and sales of butter and skimmed milk powder\u00a0(5).\n(5) An on-the-ground examination of the physical operations involved when butter and skimmed milk powder are removed from an intervention storage site was carried out. It showed that the movement of the product from the storage cell and the subsequent loading of vehicles has to be considered as a single operation. It also showed that it is not appropriate to disaggregate the cost of moving the product from the storage cell from the cost of loading of the vehicle. The same situation applies when the products are delivered to the intervention store, unloaded from vehicles and moved to the storage cell. Therefore, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 to reflect this situation and to ensure coherence with Regulation (EC) 884/2006.\n(6) In order to provide for continuity of application, this Regulation should apply from the day following the expiry of Regulation (EU) No 826/2010.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) 1272/2009 is amended as follows:\n1.
