It may not be so directed as to favour a  particular type of production in the sector concerned nor be dependent on production subsequent to  that fixed period.\nMember States shall determine the amounts and detailed rules of this aid and notify them to the  Commission for approval. The procedural provisions of Article 93 of the Treaty shall apply without  taking account of the criteria in Article 92.", "If, during the three-year period in which aid may be granted, a trend in prices due to  monetary movements is recorded before the second or third annual tranche is paid, which offsets the  losses on which the aid was based, the Commission shall decide, after consulting the Member State  concerned, to reduce appropriately or abolish the remaining tranches.", "A Member State may not notify an aid project under this Regulation after 30 June 1996.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 25 October 1995.\nFor the Council The President L.
