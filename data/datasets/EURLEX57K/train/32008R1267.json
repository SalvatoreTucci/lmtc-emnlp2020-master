It is appropriate to delete that provision in order to align the provisions in Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 to those in Article 6(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n(3) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 provides that, following the notification by the Member States of the quantities applied for import rights, the Commission has to decide as soon as possible to which extent those applications can be met. Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 provides that an allocation coefficient should only be fixed in cases where the quantities covered by applications exceed the quantities available for the import tariff quota period. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 being a horizontal Regulation, the current provision of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should therefore be deleted. Moreover, it is necessary to lay down the time period within which import rights should be awarded.\n(4) For cases where such allocation coefficient is fixed, it is necessary to specify that the securities lodged together with the applications for import rights under Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should then be released proportionally.\n(5) The second subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 provides that each issuing of an import licence has to result in a corresponding reduction of the import rights obtained. It is appropriate to specify that when issuing an import licence the security lodged together with the application for import rights should then be released proportionally.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 is amended as follows:\n1. the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) is deleted;\n2.
