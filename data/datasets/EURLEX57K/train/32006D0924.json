Those regions should therefore be added to Decision 2005/176/EC.\n(5) Spain has adjusted the names and boundaries of its veterinary regions. The adjustment of the regions in Spain affects the ADNS system set out in Decision 2005/176/EC. The new regions should therefore replace the current ones in the ADNS system.\n(6) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in May 2005 at its General Assembly adopted a revised Chapter for avian influenza, making it compulsory from 1 January 2006 to notify both highly pathogenic avian influenza and low pathogenic avian influenza to the OIE. To enable the notification to the ADNS system of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza to be distinguished from notifications of outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza, different disease codes should be given for those diseases.\n(7) Furthermore, to enable the notification of outbreaks of avian influenza in wild birds to be distinguished from those in domestic poultry, different codes should be given for these separate events.\n(8) Decision 2005/176/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) In order to protect confidentiality of the transmitted information, the Annexes to this Decision should not be published.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/176/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
