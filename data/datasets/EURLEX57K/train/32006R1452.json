Interim measures should therefore be adopted for the issue of import licences for the period ending 31 December 2006 in order to ensure the continuity of trade flows with New Zealand, until such time as the definitive arrangements for managing the tariff quota as from 1 January 2007 are put in place, ensuring non-discriminatory access of importers to the quota in conformity with the Court\u2019s judgment in Case C-313/04.\n(4) To ensure that the interim measures operate effectively and that the quantities allocated to each operator are economically viable, it is appropriate, in view of the limited time available for deliveries, to require that each application must be for a certain minimum quantity. To ensure that applications for import licences are genuine and to secure maximum utilisation of the quota it is appropriate to provide for the import licence applications to be accompanied by a contract with the exporter and for the non-transferability of the import licences.\n(5) In order to ensure that the quota is managed correctly and fairly, it is necessary to provide that if there are not a certain minimum number of applications, a new licensing round should start as quickly as possible with the ultimate result that, if there are not at least six contracts, no import licence will be issued under the transitional regime.\n(6) Imports of New Zealand butter must comply with certain quality requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001. The IMA 1 certificate should be presented at the time of import to show compliance with those requirements and to prove the origin of the butter.\n(7) For the remaining quantities to be imported in 2006 under quota No 09.4589 as referred to in Annex III (A) to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 it is therefore necessary to lift the suspension of the issuing of import licences by repealing Regulation (EC) No 1118/2006 and to derogate from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001.\n(8) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Import of New Zealand butter\nSave as otherwise provided for in this Regulation, Chapter III of Title 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 shall apply to the import of a quantity of 14\u00a0294,6 tonnes of butter for the year 2006 under quota number 09.4589 referred to in Annex III(A) to that Regulation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018New Zealand butter\u2019) for which the issue of licences was suspended under Regulation (EC) No 1118/2006.", "Conditions for applications for import licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for licences for import of New Zealand butter under this Regulation shall be admissible only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) the importers must be approved under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 and, by way of derogation from Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, lodge licence applications in the Member State in which they are approved;\n(b) importers must submit the original or an authenticated copy of a purchase contract with a New Zealand exporter for the import of butter as described in Annex III(A) to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 for a quantity at least equal to that mentioned in the application;\n(c) importers may lodge only one application and if they lodge more than one application, all those applications shall be rejected;\n(d) applications must relate to a quantity of at least 1\u00a0000 tonnes but to no more than 30\u00a0% of the quantity referred to in Article 1.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications shall be lodged from 16 to 18 October 2006.", "Issue of licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 20 October 2006 at the latest, Member States shall notify the Commission by fax or electronic mail of the licence applications lodged under this Regulation, specifying the names of the applicants and the quantities applied for by each one.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall decide within three working days following the date referred to in paragraph 1 to what extent licence applications may be accepted and shall inform the Member States of its decision.
