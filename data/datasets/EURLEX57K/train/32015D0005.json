The elimination of the spread reflects the reduction in term premia of market-based funding instruments for institutions since the announcement of TLTROs on 5 June 2014. The decision does not affect the interest rate which is applied to the first TLTROs conducted in September and December 2014. This rate therefore remains unchanged, i.e. it is fixed over the life of each operation at the rate for MROs prevailing at the time of the tender announcement in respect of the relevant TLTRO, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points.\n(3) In addition, certain minor corrections are required to Decision ECB/2014/34\u00a0(2).\n(4) Therefore, Decision ECB/2014/34 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDecision ECB/2014/34 is amended as follows:\n1.
