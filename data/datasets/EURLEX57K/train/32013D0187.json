It is therefore necessary to update the formulas of the authorised methods.\n(3) The Czech Republic has requested the Commission to authorise the replacement of the formulas used for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which those formulas are based, the result of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(3).\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those new formulas are fulfilled. Those formulas should therefore be authorised in the Czech Republic.\n(5) The Czech Republic has requested the Commission to be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcasses different from the standard presentation defined in the first paragraph of point B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(6) In accordance with the second paragraph of point B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcasses different from the standard presentation defined in the first paragraph of that point, where normal commercial practice in their territory differs from that standard presentation. In its request, the Czech Republic specified that in its territory it is commercial practice that carcasses can be presented without ears and with the flare fat. These presentations that differ from the standard presentation should therefore be authorised in the Czech Republic.\n(7) In order to establish quotations for pig carcasses on a comparable basis, this different presentation should be taken into account by adjusting the weight recorded in such cases in relation to the weight for standard presentation.\n(8) Decision 2005/1/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Implementing Decision.\n(10) In view of the technical circumstances while introducing new formulas and new equations, the formulas of the authorised methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under this Decision should apply from 1 July 2013.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/1/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) the third paragraph of Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 1a is replaced by the following:\n(a) without ears, ears having been removed before the carcass is being weighed and graded.
