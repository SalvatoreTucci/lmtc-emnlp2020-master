Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2729/94 (see page 5 of this Official Journal).\nANNEX\nArrangements for the payments stipulated in the first indent of Article 2\n1. Payments into the Fund will be made in accordance with the arrangements set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, depending on whether the operations concerned are:\n(a) Community borrowing/lending operations or guarantees to financial bodies, whether made in one or more than one tranche, except those covered by (b) (1);\n(b) Community borrowing/lending operations or guarantees to financial bodies under a framework facility spread over a number of years and with a micro-economic and structural purpose (2).\n2. For the operations referred to under point 1 (a) the Comission will start the procedure for making the payments into the Fund as soon as the Council has formally adopted the basic decision. The amount to be paid into the Fund will be calculated on the basis of the total amount for the operation decided on by the Council.\n3. For the operations referred to under point 1 (b), payments into the Fund will be made in annual tranches calculated on the basis of the annual amounts indicated in the financial statement attached to the Commission proposal, adapted where appropriate in the light of the Council decision.\nThe Commission will start the procedure for making payments into the Fund as soon as the Council has formally adopted the basic decision, or at the beginning of the following financial year if no operation is programmed for the current financial year. For subsequent financial years the Commission will start the payment procedure at the beginning of the financial year.\nAs from the second year, the amounts to be paid into the Fund will be corrected by the difference recorded on 31 December of the previous year between the estimates that were taken as a basis for the previous payment and the actual figure for the loans signed during that year. Any difference relating to the previous year will give rise to a payment in the following year.\n4. When it starts a payment procedure the Commission will check the situation with regard to the performance of the operations which were the subject of previous payments and, where the commitment deadlines originally laid down have not been met, will propose that this be taken into acount in calculating the first payment to be made at the start of the following financial year for operations already under way.\n5. For operations decided on by the Council as from 1 January 1993 the Commission will start the procedure for making payments into the Fund as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Regulation, in accordance with the arrangements set out in the preceding paragraphs.\n(1) Examples of this type of operation: loans for the balance of payments of third countries or the guarantee granted to a consortium of commercial banks to finance the purchase of food products in third countries.\n(2) Examples of this type of operation: Euratom loans to third countries and the guarantees granted to the EIB for its loans in the developing countries in Latin America and Asia (DCLAA) and the central and eastern European countries (CEEC)."}
