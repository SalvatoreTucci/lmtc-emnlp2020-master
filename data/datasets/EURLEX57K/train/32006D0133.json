(the pine wood nematode) as regards areas in Portugal, other than those in which it is known not to occur\n(notified under document number C(2006) 345)\n(2006/133/EC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 16(3) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode (PWN)), from another Member State, it should be authorised to temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger.\n(2) Portugal informed the other Member States and the Commission on 25 June 1999 that some samples of pine trees originating in its territory were identified as infested by PWN. The Commission has adopted Decisions 2000/58/EC\u00a0(2) and 2001/218/EC\u00a0(3) defining measures to be taken against PWN.\n(3) On the basis of assessments by the Food and Veterinary Office, most recently in November 2004, additional information submitted by Portugal and official surveys carried out by the other Member States on wood, isolated bark and plants of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Larix Mill., Picea A. Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr., it appears that as a result of the application of an eradication programme in Portugal, the spread of PWN remains limited to the demarcated areas in Portugal. However, trees showing symptoms of infestation by PWN were still found during surveys of those areas.\n(4) The implementation of the Portuguese mid-term eradication plan for PWN of February 2003, as amended in June 2003, was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in its meetings of July 2004 and May 2005. During the latter meeting it was concluded that the aimed reduction of infection level in the demarcated zone had not been fully achieved so far.\n(5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to continue to take specific measures with respect to movements of wood, isolated bark and host plants within demarcated areas in Portugal and from such areas into other areas of Portugal and into the other Member States.\n(6) It is also necessary that Portugal continues to take measures to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradication. Therefore, an updated mid-term eradication plan to better control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating should be presented.\n(7) The other Member States should continue to have the possibility to apply additional measures to protect their territories from PWN.\n(8) The results of the specific measures and of the implementation of the mid-term plan should be assessed continuously, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018the pine wood nematode (PWN)\u2019: Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al.;\n(b) \u2018susceptible wood and bark\u2019: wood and isolated bark of conifers (Coniferales), except that of Thuja L.;\n(c) \u2018susceptible plants\u2019: plants (other than fruit and seeds) of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Larix Mill., Picea A.

In cases of movements within demarcated areas of Portugal:\n(a) susceptible plants:\n\u2014 grown in places of production where no symptoms of PWN have been observed, or in its immediate vicinity since the beginning of the last complete cycle of vegetation and found free from signs or symptoms of PWN during official inspections, shall be accompanied by the said plant passport when moved from the place of production,\n\u2014 grown in places of production where symptoms of PWN have been observed, or in its immediate vicinity, since the beginning of the last complete cycle of vegetation or identified as infested by PWN shall not be moved from the place of production and shall be destroyed by burning,\n\u2014 grown in places, such as forests, public or private gardens, which are either identified as infested by PWN, or showing any symptoms of poor health or situated in salvage areas, shall:\n\u2014 if identified in the period 1 November to 1 April, be felled within that period, or\n\u2014 if identified in the period 2 April to 31 October, be felled immediately and,\n\u2014 if located in the part of demarcated areas designated as buffer zones in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, tested for the presence of PWN. If the presence is confirmed, the delimitation of the demarcated areas shall be changed accordingly;\n(b) during the period between 1 November and 1 April, susceptible wood in the form of roundwood or sawnwood, with or without bark, including that which has not kept its natural round surface:\n(i) obtained from trees identified as infested by PWN, or situated in salvage areas, or showing any symptoms of poor health, shall before 2 April either be:\n\u2014 destroyed by burning under official control at appropriate places, or\n\u2014 moved under official control to either:\n\u2014 a processing plant to be chipped and utilised within this plant, or\n\u2014 an industrial plant for use as fuel wood within this plant, or\n\u2014 a processing plant, where the wood shall either be:\n\u2014 heat treated in such a way that a minimum wood core temperature of 56\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes has been achieved, or\n\u2014 chipped and fumigated in order to ensure freedom from live PWNs;\n(ii) obtained from trees other than those referred to in subparagraph (i) shall be officially tested for the presence of PWN and of Monochamus spp.; if the presence of PWN or of Monochamus spp. is confirmed the wood shall be subjected to the provisions referred to in subparagraph (i); if the presence of PWN and of Monochamus spp. is refuted, the wood may be moved under official control to a processing plant for further use as construction timber, or by way of derogation moved into areas in Portugal, other than demarcated areas under official control to approved processing plants notified to the Commission, where the wood or chips made from such wood, within the period between 1 November and 1 April, shall either:\n\u2014 in the case of chips, be used for industrial purposes within such an approved processing plant, or\n\u2014 in the case of wood:\n\u2014 be heat treated in such a way that a minimum wood-core temperature of 56\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes has been achieved. Further movement of such heat-treated wood may be allowed when the wood is accompanied by a plant passport, or\n\u2014 be chipped and fumigated in order to ensure freedom from live PWNs.
