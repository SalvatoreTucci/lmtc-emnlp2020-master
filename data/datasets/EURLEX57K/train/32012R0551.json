For the same reasons it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2012, for two products a new tariff quota at a zero duty rate for an appropriate volume.\n(2) The quota volumes, previously established, for autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order numbers 09.2638, 09.2814 and 09.2889 are insufficient to meet the needs of the Union industry. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased with effect from\u00a01 January 2012.\n(3) Moreover, for the autonomous tariff quota of the Union with the order number 09.2633 the product description should be adapted.\n(4) In addition, for the quota with order number 09.2767, it is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant a tariff quota for the second semester 2012. That tariff quota should therefore be closed with effect from 1 July 2012 and the corresponding row should be deleted from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No\u00a07/2010.\n(5) Since some of the measures provided for in this Regulation should take effect from\u00a01 January 2012 and others from 1 July 2012, this Regulation should apply from those same dates and should enter into force immediately upon publication in the Official\u00a0Journal of the European Union.\n(6) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the rows with order numbers 09.2644 and 09.2645 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are\u00a0inserted;\n(2) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2638, 09.2814 and 09.2889 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n(3) the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2633 is replaced by the row set out in Annex I to this Regulation;\n(4) the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2767 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the\u00a0European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2012.\nHowever, Article 1(2) shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 21 June 2012.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
