These derogations expired on 14 March 2008.\n(2) Ireland requested an extension of the derogations for a further five years on 13 March 2007 and the United Kingdom made the same request on 14 March 2007.\n(3) Based on evidence provided from the concerned Member States the Commission concluded that the specific geographical situation of Ireland and Northern Ireland and, at this stage, the lack of development prospects for rail freight services and international rail passenger services would justify extending the derogations by another five years. In the coming years, the potential cost of complying with the requirements of the Directives covered by the derogations would outweigh the potential benefits of a full implementation of the regulatory framework for a Community-wide market for rail transport services.\n(4) Several requests by the Commission for further substantiation of the requests and delays in their provision have led to a delay in the establishment of this Decision. The Decision extending the derogations granted to Ireland and the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, should take retroactive effect from 15 March 2008.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Developing European Railways Committee, set up by Article 11a of Directive 91/440/EEC and by Article 35 of Directive 2001/14/EC,", "main_body": ["The derogation granted to Ireland and the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, referred to in Article 14a(1) of Directive 91/440/EEC is extended until 14 March 2013.", "The derogation granted to Ireland and the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive 2001/14/EC is extended until 14 March 2013.", "This Decision shall apply from 15 March 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 237, 24.8.1991, p. 25.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 75, 15.3.2001, p. 29."}
