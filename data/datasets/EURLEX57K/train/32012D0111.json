For that purpose, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof (\u2018countries or regions\u2019) is according to Article 5(1) and Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved, namely a negligible BSE risk, a controlled BSE risk and an undetermined BSE risk.\n(2) The Annex to Commission Decision 2007/453/EC of 29 June 2007 establishing the BSE status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof according to their BSE risk\u00a0(2) lists countries or regions according to their BSE risk status.\n(3) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) plays a leading role in the categorisation of countries or regions according to their BSE risk and employs criteria equivalent to those established in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC takes account of Resolution No 18 \u2013 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Members \u2013 adopted by the OIE in May 2010 regarding the BSE status of Member States and third countries\u00a0(3).\n(4) In May 2011, the OIE adopted Resolution No 17 \u2013 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Members. That Resolution recognised Denmark and Panama as having a negligible BSE risk. The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended to be brought into line with that Resolution as regards those countries\u00a0(4).\n(5) Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 February 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 84.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0See pp. 40 and 158 of Report of the General Session 23-28 May 2010 at http://www.oie.int/eng/session2011/A_FR_2010PUB.pdf\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See pp. 49 and 149 of Report of the General Session 22-27 May 2011 at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/A_FR_2011_PUB.pdf\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nLIST OF COUNTRIES OR REGIONS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a negligible BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Denmark\n\u2014 Finland\n\u2014 Sweden\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Iceland\n\u2014 Norway\nThird countries\n\u2014 Argentina\n\u2014 Australia\n\u2014 Chile\n\u2014 India\n\u2014 New Zealand\n\u2014 Panama\n\u2014 Paraguay\n\u2014 Peru\n\u2014 Singapore\n\u2014 Uruguay\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a controlled BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, the United Kingdom\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Liechtenstein\n\u2014 Switzerland\nThird countries\n\u2014 Brazil\n\u2014 Canada\n\u2014 Colombia\n\u2014 Japan\n\u2014 Mexico\n\u2014 South Korea\n\u2014 Taiwan\n\u2014 United States\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with an undetermined BSE risk\n\u2014 Countries or regions not listed in point A or B of this Annex.\u2019"}
