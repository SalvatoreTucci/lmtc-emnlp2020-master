The Statute may provide for the Court of First Instance to have jurisdiction for other classes of action or proceeding.\u2019.\n(2) Article 3(13) of the Treaty of Nice made a similar amendment to the EAEC Treaty.\n(3) Account was taken of that amendment in the provisional draft of Article 51 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice under which: \u2018By way of exception to the rule laid down in Article 225(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 140a(1) of the EAEC Treaty, the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction in actions brought by the Member States, the institutions of the Communities and the European Central Bank.\u2019.\n(4) In accordance with the letter and general scheme of the new Article 225 of the EC Treaty and of the new Article 140a of the EAEC Treaty, it is necessary to redraft Article 51 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice in order to define the respective jurisdictions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, since the transfer of jurisdiction at first instance to the Court of First Instance has to be significant and the criteria for allocation of jurisdiction sufficiently clear to be understood unequivocally by the institutions and the Member States.\n(5) Actions brought by the Member States against acts of the Council by which it exercises implementing powers in accordance with the rules referred to in the third indent of Article 202 of the EC Treaty should fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance. These are cases where the Council has either reserved the right to exercise implementing powers or has regained the right to exercise such powers in the course of a \u2018committee procedure\u2019.\n(6) The provisions of Article 54 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice concerning the circumstances in which the Court of First Instance may decline jurisdiction in favour of the Court of Justice should be amended so as to accord with the new powers of the Court of First Instance. It is necessary to allow for jurisdiction to be declined where related cases are brought before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance in which the outcome of one of them may depend on that of the other,", "main_body": ["1.
