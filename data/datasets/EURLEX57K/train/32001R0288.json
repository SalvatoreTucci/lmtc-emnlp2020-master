Those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2738/1999 of 21 December 1999 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted(5).\n(2) Pursuant to Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the Member States were authorised by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1289/2000(6) to pay an initial advance of the premium and of the specific aid and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2301/2000(7) to pay a second advance of the premium to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers. The definitive premiums to be paid in respect of the 2000 marketing year must thus be fixed.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the amount of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that Article by a coefficient expressing the annual average production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs expressed per 100 kg of carcass weight. Article 5(3) of that Regulation fixes the coefficient for producers of light lambs at 80 % of the coefficient for producers of heavy lambs. Article 5(5) of that Regulation also fixes the amount per female for producers of the caprine species at 80 % of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article. That coefficient is fixed by Article 13(4) at 7 %.\n(5) Under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1323/90(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 193/98(9), the Council instituted specific aid for sheep and goat farming in certain less-favoured areas of the Community. It lays down that the aid is to be granted under the same conditions as those for the grant of the premium for producers of sheepmeat and goatmeat.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application of specific measures relating to agricultural production in the Canary Islands. Those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the premium payable to producers of light lambs and she-goats on the same conditions as those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98. Those conditions provide for Spain to be authorised to pay the supplement to the premium.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["It is hereby noted that the difference between the basic price less the impact of the coefficient provided for in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and the Community market price during the 2000 marketing year was EUR 111,531 per 100 kg.", "The coefficient provided for in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 is hereby fixed at 15,67 kg.", "Pursuant to Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1323/90 the Member States are authorised to pay a specific aid to producers of sheepmeat and goatmeat in less-favoured areas within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3493/90(10).
