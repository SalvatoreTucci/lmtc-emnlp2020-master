The measure also has the effect of simplifying the work of the tax authorities, which very frequently have major problems collecting the VAT due by subcontractors in that sector, without having any effect on the amount of tax due.\n(6) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued, since it is not intended to apply to all taxable operations in the sector concerned but only to specific operations which pose considerable problems of tax evasion or avoidance.\n(7) The authorisation should apply from the date envisaged for the application of the corresponding national provision in the second Abgaben\u0102\u00a4nderungsgesetz 2002. It should be limited to 31 December 2007, so that in the light of experience gleaned up to that date an assessment may be made of whether or not the derogation remains justified.\n(8) This derogation does not adversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as worded in Article 28(g) thereof, Austria is hereby authorised, with effect from 1 October 2002, to designate the recipients of the supplies of services referred to in Article 2 of this Decision as the persons liable to pay VAT.", "The recipient of the supply of services may be designated as the person liable to pay VAT in the following instances:\n1. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to a general contractor;\n2. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to a company which carries out its own construction work;\n3. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to another subcontractor.", "This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2007.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Austria."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nT.
