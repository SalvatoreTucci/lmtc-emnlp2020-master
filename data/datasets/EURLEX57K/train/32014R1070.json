The application was accompanied by the relevant supporting data. The Commission forwarded that application to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019).\n(4) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 20 May 2014\u00a0(5) that, under the new proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) has the potential to be efficacious at the requested minimum doses of 280\u00a0TXU/kg and 125\u00a0TGU/kg of complete feedingstuff on laying hens. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of\u00a0analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 271/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 271/2009, in the column \u2018Minimum content\u2019 corresponding to the entry for laying hens, \u2018560 TXU\u2019 is replaced by \u2018280 TXU\u2019 and \u2018250 TGU\u2019 is replaced by \u2018125 TGU\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 271/2009 of 2 April 2009 concerning the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase as a feed additive for weaned piglets, chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening and ducks for fattening (holder of the authorisation BASF SE) (OJ L\u00a091, 3.4.2009, p.\u00a05).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1068/2011 of 21 October 2011 concerning the authorisation of an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM\u00a018404) as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, turkeys for breeding purposes, turkeys reared for breeding, other minor avian species (other than ducks for fattening) and ornamental birds (holder of authorisation BASF SE) (OJ L\u00a0277, 22.10.2011, p.\u00a011).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1404/2013 of 20 December 2013 concerning the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM\u00a018404) as a feed additive for pigs for fattening (holder of authorisation BASF SE) (OJ L\u00a0349, 21.12.2013, p.\u00a088).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(6):3723."}
