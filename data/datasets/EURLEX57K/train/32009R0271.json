That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the enzyme preparation endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404), as a feed additive for weaned piglets, chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening and ducks for fattening to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) From the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 3\u00a0December 2008 and on 9 December 2008\u00a0(2) it results that the enzyme preparation endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404), as produced by the applicant BASF SE, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health and the environment and that it is efficacious in increasing performance of piglets and chickens for fattening and in improving feed conversion in turkeys for fattening and laying hens. Based on the data provided for chickens for fattening, it was assumed efficacious also for ducks for fattening. It further concluded that the product may be a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 914, 1-21.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
