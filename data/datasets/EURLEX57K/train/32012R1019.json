The application was accompanied by the relevant supporting data.\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 2 February 2012\u00a0(4) that, under the new proposed conditions of use, the enzyme concerned is efficacious at the requested minimum dose of 280 TXU/kg.
