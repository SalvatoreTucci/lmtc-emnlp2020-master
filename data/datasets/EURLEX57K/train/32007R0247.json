For the 2007/2008 marketing year those quotas must be adjusted by the end of February 2007 at the latest.\n(2) The adjustments result in particular from the application of Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, which provide for the allocation of additional sugar quotas and additional and supplementary isoglucose quotas. The adjustments must take account of the communications from the Member States provided for in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system\u00a0(2). These communications were sent to the Commission before 31 January 2007 and relate in particular to the additional and supplementary quotas already allocated on the date on which the communication was drawn up.\n(3) Undertakings may request additional sugar quotas until 30 September 2007. Supplementary isoglucose quotas are allocated in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Member States. The additional and supplementary quotas which are to be allocated for the 2007/2008 marketing year, but which do not appear in the communications sent before 31 January 2007, will be taken into account in the next adjustment of the quotas laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 before the end of February 2008.\n(4) The adjustments to the quotas laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 also result from the application of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3), which provides for restructuring aid for undertakings which renounce their quotas. It is therefore necessary to take account of the quotas renounced for the 2007/2008 marketing year under the restructuring scheme.\n(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
