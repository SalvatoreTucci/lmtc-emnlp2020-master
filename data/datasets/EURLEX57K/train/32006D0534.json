If there have been new developments, these should be described in a new answer.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General description\nWhat are the main features of national legislation that are necessary to set up an authorisation or registration system to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Directive? Please detail changes in national legislation during the reporting period concerning Directive 1999/13/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coverage of installations\nFor each of the twenty sections of Annex II A, please estimate how many installations fall into the categories set out below (Member States with a different sector classification in their national legislation may use it in terms of answering this question):\n\u2014 all existing installations, encompassed by Article 2(2) of the Directive, at the end of the reporting period,\n\u2014 all installations which were registered or authorised by the competent authority during the reporting period,\n\u2014 of the installations referred to in the previous indent, how many were authorised or registered pursuant to Article 4(4) of the Directive? (optional),\n\u2014 how many of these installations are also covered by the IPPC Directive? (optional).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basic operator obligations\nIn general terms, what administrative provisions have been put into place to allow the competent authorities to ensure that installations operate in accordance with the general principles set out in Article 5?\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existing installations\nHow many existing installations are authorised or registered as using the reduction scheme of Annex II B, according to Article 4(3).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All installations\n5.1. Following Article 5(3)(a), Member States shall report to the Commission on the derogation concerning the application of fugitive emission limit values.\n\u2014 Have there been any derogations?\n\u2014 In these cases, how is it demonstrated that for the individual installation concerned this value was not technically and economically feasible?\n\u2014 How is it taken into account that significant risks to human health or the environment are not to be expected?\n5.2. Following Article 5(3)(b), activities which cannot be operated under contained conditions may be exempted from the controls of Annex II A when this possibility is explicitly mentioned in that Annex.\n\u2014 How many operators have used this possibility and for how many installations?\n\u2014 How is it demonstrated that the reduction scheme of Annex II B is not technically and economically feasible?\n\u2014 How does the operator demonstrate for the respective installations that the best available technique is being used?\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National plans\n6.1. Has the Member State decided to define and implement a National Plan according to Article 6? (see Commission Decision 2000/541/EC of 6 September 2000 on criteria for assessing national plans according to Article 6 of Council Directive 1999/13/EC\u00a0(1)).\n6.2. How many installations have been included under the national plan? What is the emission reduction target which the plan will deliver? What is the current overall emission for the installations covered by the plan? How does this compare with any interim reduction target falling within this reporting period?\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Substitution\nFollowing the provision of guidance by the Commission according to Article 7(1), to what extent has this been taken into account for the authorisation and formulation of general binding rules (see Article 7(2))?\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring\n8.1.

What measures are taken by the competent authority to ensure that this information is supplied within the shortest possible time?\n8.2.

Please, inform about examples of measures to ensure compliance applied during the period.\n10.2. What are, in general terms, the most common practices concerning regular on-site inspections by competent authorities? In case those are not carried out, how do competent authorities verify the information provided by the operator?\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reduction scheme\n11.1. What is the procedure to ensure that the reduction scheme proposed by the operator corresponds as closely as possible to the emissions which would have resulted if the emission limit values set out in Annex II of the Directive had been applied? Please provide information about your experience with the application of the reduction scheme.\n11.2. If you have used the reduction scheme proposed in Annex II B(2), please answer the following questions:\n11.2.1.
