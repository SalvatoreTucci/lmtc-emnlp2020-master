Part I of the Annex lists the names of the countries and territories covered by a specific Decision and part II names those qualifying under Article 2(2) of Decision 95/408/EC.\n(2) Commission Decisions 2001/632/EC(5), 2001/633/EC(6), and 2001/634/EC(7) set specific import conditions for fishery and aquaculture products originating in Nicaragua, Uganda and Guinea, respectively. Nicaragua, Uganda and Guinea should therefore be added to part I of the Annex.\n(3) The Republic of El Salvador and Mayotte, have provided information that they satisfy the equivalent conditions and are able to guarantee that the fishery products they will export to the Community shall meet the health requirements of Council Directive 91/493/EC. It is therefore necessary to modify the above list to include these countries in part II of the list. Nevertheless, following the information and the guarantees received from Mayotte it should be necessary to restrain the imports of fishery products from this territory to non-processed and non-prepared fresh aquaculture products only.\n(4) Following Decision 1/2001 of the EC-Faeroe Island Joint Committee of 31 January 2001 laying down the provisions to implement the Protocol on veterinary matters supplementing the Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part(8); the Faeroe Islands undertake to apply the provisions laid down in Council Directives 91/493/EEC and 92/48/EEC(9), and their rules of application fixed in the relevant Commission decisions. Under the provisions of this Agreement it is necessary to apply to fishery products originating or proceeding from the Faeroe Islands to the EC, the provisions laid down in Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market(10) and, therefore, this country shall be deleted from the list of countries and territories annexed to Decision 97/296/EC.\n(5) Since Decisions 2001/632/EC, 2001/633/EC and 2001/634/EC will enter into force 60 days after their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities, it is necessary to apply the same delay for the enter into force of this Decision. Nevertheless, since the imports of fishery products from Mayotte and El Salvador will be authorised for the first time by this Decision, the import of fishery products from El Salvador and Mayotte may be permitted immediately.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to this Decision replaces the Annex to Decision 97/296/EC.", "1.
