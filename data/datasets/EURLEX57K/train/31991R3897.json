whereas experience has shown that this  transitional period is too short to allow certain Member States to establish larger units; whereas  this period should be extended;\nWhereas Article 37 (1) (e) of Regulation (EEC) No 2392/89 lays down a prohibition on covering the  closing device of wine bottles with capsules containing lead; whereas in order to align the terms  in which that prohibition is expressed on those of Resolution No 7 approved on 6 September 1991 in  Paris by the International Vine and Wine Office, the abovementioned provision should be amended;\nWhereas experience has shown that it is important to provide that the geographical name designating  a specified region must be sufficiently precise to avoid any possibility of confusion;\nWhereas the use of brand names for the labelling of wines and grape musts is governed by Article 40  (2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2392/89; whereas, with a view to providing effective protection  for geographical names used for the description of wine-sector products, these provisions prohibit,  for the description and presentation of such products, the use of brand names which contain wording  that is identical to a geographical name used to describe a table wine, a quality wine psr or an  imported wine, unless the product described by the brand name in question is entitled to such a  name; whereas the application of these provisions has shown that there are well-known brand names  corresponding to the identity of the original holder or of the original provider of the name, which  have been registered and used for at least 25 years before the date of official recognition of the  geographical name; whereas such brand names should be allowed to continue to be used,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2392/89 shall be amended as follows:\n1.  in the last subparagraph of paragraph 4 (4), '31 August 1991` shall be replaced by '31 August  1993`;\n2.\nthe following subparagraph shall be added to Article 5 (1) (f) and to Article 14 (1) (e):\n'This does not apply to the use of the name of the variety \"Barbera\" in relation to the name of the  specified region \"Conca de Barber\u00e1\".';\n3.\npoint (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 13 (3) shall be replaced by the following:\n'(b)  the name of a geographical unit as referred to in paragraph 1 where the wine is obtained from  a mixture of grapes, grape musts, new wines still in fermentation or, until 31 August 1995, wines  originating in the geographical unit the name of which is to be used for the designation, with a  product obtained in the same specified region but outside that unit, provided that at least 85 % of  the quality wine psr concerned is obtained from grapes picked in the geographical unit whose name  it bears;`;\n4.\nthe following point (f) shall be added to Article 20 (2):\n'(f)  a brand name, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 40.`;\n5.\nthe following subparagraph shall be added to Article 27 (2):\n'In addition, the description may be supplemented by the indication of a brand name, in accordance  with the conditions laid down in Article 40.`;\n6.", "7 (1) (e) shall be replaced by the following:\n'(e)  have a closing device which is not covered with a capsule made on the basis of lead.`;\n7.", "0 shall be amended as follows:\n(a)  the following subparagraph shall be added to paragraph 1:\n'The geographical name designating a specified region must be sufficiently precise and familiarly  linked to the area of production so that, taking account of the existing situations, confusion may  be avoided.`;\n(b)\nthe second subparagraph to paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n'Moreover, the holder of a well-known registered brand name for a wine or a grape must which  contains wording that is identical to the name of a specified region or the name of a geographical  unit smaller than a specified region may, even if he is not entitled to use such a name pursuant to  paragraph 2, continue to use that brand name where it corresponds to the identity of its original  holder or of the original provider of the name, provided that the brand name was registered at  least 25 years before the official recognition of the geographical name in question by the producer  Member State in accordance with Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 823/87 as regards quality  wines psr and that the brand name has actually been used without interruption.\nBrand names complying with the conditions of the first and second subparagraphs may not be invoked  against the use of the names of geographical units used to describe a quality wine psr or a table  wine.`.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nWith regard to Article 1:\n- point 3 shall apply from 1 September 1991,\n- point 6 shall apply from 1 January 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 1991.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.
