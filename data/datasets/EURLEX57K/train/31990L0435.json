By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States shall have the option of:\n- replacing, by means of bilateral agreement, the criterion of a holding in the capital by that of a holding of voting rights,\n- not applying this Directive to companies of that Member State which do not maintain for an uninterrupted period of at least two years holdings qualifying them as parent companies or to those of their companies in which a company of another Member  State does not maintain such a holding for an uninterrupted period of at least two years.", "1.  Where a parent company, by virtue of its association with its subsidiary, receives distributed profits, the State of the parent company shall, except when the latter is liquidated, either:\n- refrain from taxing such profits, or\n- tax such profits while authorizing the parent company to deduct from the amount of tax due that fraction of the corporation tax paid by the subsidiary which relates to those profits and, if appropriate, the amount of the withholding tax levied by the  Member State in which the subsidiary is resident, pursuant to the derogations provided for in Article 5, up to the limit of the amount of the corresponding domestic tax.\n2.  However, each Member State shall retain the option of providing that any charges relating to the holding and any losses resulting from the distribution of the profits of the subsidiary may not be deducted from the taxable profits of the parent  company. Where the management costs relating to the holding in such a case are fixed as a flat rate, the fixed amount may not exceed 5 % of the profits distributed by the subsidiary.\n3.  Paragraph 1 shall apply until the date of effective entry into force of a common system of company taxation.\nThe Council shall at the appropriate time adopt the rules to apply after the date referred to in the first subparagraph.", "1.  Profits which a subsidiary distributed to its parent company shall, at least where the latter holds a minimum of 25 % of the capital of the subsidiary, be exempt from withholding tax.\n2.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Hellenic Republic may, for so long as it does not charge corporation tax on distributed profits, levy a withholding tax on profits distributed to parent companies of other Member States. However, the rate of that  withholding tax must not exceed the rate provided for in bilateral double-taxation agreements.\n3.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Federal Republic of Germany may, for as long as it charges corporation tax on distributed profits at a rate at least 11 points lower than the rate applicable to retained profits, and at the latest until mid-1996,  impose a compensatory withholding tax of 5 % on profits distributed by its subsidiary companies.\n4.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Portuguese Republic may levy a withholding tax on profits distributed by its subsidiaries to parent companies of other Member States until a date not later than the end of the eighth year following the date of  application of this Directive.\nSubject to the existing bilateral agreements concluded between Portugal and a Member State, the rate of this withholding tax may not exceed 15 % during the first five years and 10 % during the last three years of that period.\nBefore the end of the eighth year the Council shall decide unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission, on a possible extension of the provisions of this paragraph.", "The Member State of a parent company may not charge withholding tax on the profits which such a company receives from a subsidiary.", "1.
