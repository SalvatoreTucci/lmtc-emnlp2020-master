2 of Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 of 27 November 2009 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards export

under the quota to the United States.\n(2) In accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 789/2011 of 5 August 2011 opening the procedure for the allocation of export licences for cheese to be exported to the United States of America in 2012 under certain GATT quotas\u00a0(3), was adopted for 2012 quota year.\n(3) For sake of administrative simplification, it is appropriate to integrate into Section 2 of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 a permanent mechanism as regards the opening of a yearly procedure for the allocation of export licences, instead of adopting a separate Regulation each year.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are
