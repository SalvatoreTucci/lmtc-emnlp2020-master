Tariffs are not negotiable for households;\n2. a tariff price is a price within a tariff that applies to a component element or unit of consumption of the good or service in question.", "Basic information\nThe basic information shall be all tariff prices and weights which reflect the structure of the consumption of the good or services according to the characteristics of the consumers, the level, the structure or the timing of the consumption.", "Data sources\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HICP sub-indices involving tariff prices shall be computed by the Member States from basic information as defined in Article 3 provided by the supplier.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statistical units called upon by the Member States to cooperate in the collection or provision of basic information are obliged to give honest and complete information at the time it is requested and allow the organisations and institutions responsible for compiling official statistics at their request to obtain information at the level of detail necessary to evaluate compliance with the comparability requirements and the quality of the HICP sub-indices.", "Procedure\nHICP sub-indices involving tariff prices shall be calculated using a formula which is consistent with the Laspeyres-type formula used for other sub-indices. They should reflect the price change on the basis of the changed expenditure of maintaining that consumption pattern chosen by households prior to the given change in the tariff. Where there is a change in the tariff and where, after that change:\n1. a component element or a unit of consumption remains unchanged with respect to its specification, then the price for that element or unit according to the old and the new tariff shall be directly compared and the price difference taken into the HICP;\n2. a component element or a unit of consumption changes with respect to its specification, or a new component element is added which does not constitute a new good or service for the consumer, then the price change shall be computed with weights corresponding to the expenditure of preserving the pattern of consumption applying during a period, up to one year, preceding the change. The adjustments for specification changes shall be consistent with quality adjustments made for other sub-indices;\n3. a component element or a unit of consumption with a new and distinct specification constituting a new good or service for the consumer is added to the tariff, it shall be treated as \u2018newly significant goods and services\u2019 as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1749/96. If the expenditure on the new good or service is significant it shall be taken into the index by linking from the month when the new tariff comes into force using an estimate of expected immediate consumption or within a period of 12 months otherwise.", "Comparability\nHICPs constructed following the procedures described in Article 5 of this Regulation or following other procedures which do not result in an index which differs systematically by more than one-tenth of one percentage point on average over one year against the previous year from an index compiled following those procedures, shall be deemed comparable.\nAny amendments of procedures and practices to secure comparability as defined in this paragraph shall be implemented at the earliest for the sub-indices following the entry into force of this Regulation, and at the latest by December 1998 and take effect with the index for January 1999.", "Quality control\nMember States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with information on the procedures developed for the treatment of tariff prices where these procedures differ from those specified in Article 5 of this Regulation, before such procedures are used.\nMember States shall also provide the Commission (Eurostat), on its request, with information on the procedures used for meeting the requirement of minimum standards established in this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 1998.\nFor the Commission\nYves-Thibault DE SILGUY\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 257, 27. 10. 1995, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Opinion delivered on 8 July 1998.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 229, 10. 9. 1996, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 214, 31. 7. 1998, p. 23."}
