It is cordate-oblate in shape. Its equatorial section has a diameter of at least 40\u00a0mm. Its neck is narrow, thin and closed. The height of each onion, measured from the circular base of the bulb to the closed neck must be 10-50\u00a0% less than the diameter of its widest part (equatorial diameter).\nThe dry outer skins are reddish brown to pale red in colour. The flesh is white with a bluish or purplish tinge and a more distinct purple edge.\n\u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 typically has a moderately pungent taste and a strong onion smell.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area\nOnions marketed under the name \u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 have to be produced in the geographical area.\nThe onion seed or sets must be produced in the geographical area or bought from seed producers which can prove that they carry out maintenance breeding of the Ptujska rde\u010da variety.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 is sold in traditional wreaths (rye straw, six or twelve onions of the same size and colour, without the use of twine, wire or the like), in small packages, and loose.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nOnions which satisfy the conditions laid down in the specification are labelled with the name \u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019, the words \u2018protected geographical indication\u2019 and the national quality symbol.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area where production takes place is historically determined, comprising the Ptujsko Polje. This is a plain delimited by the town of Ptuj, the River Drava, the margins of the Slovenske Gorice hills and the settlements of Mihovci and Velika Nedelja.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe Ptujsko Polje is part of a flatland natural region where the land evolved on a pedosequence of sand and gravel. The soils are shallow, with a high sandy-particle and rock content. Owing to the continental climate, with spring rainfall and hot and relatively dry summers, these soils are often prone to drought. With regard to pedogenesis, the two pedosequences each have two soil systems. On gravel and sand, there are alluvial soils on a Holocene terrace and brown soils on a Pleistocene terrace, whereas on clay and loam there are brown pseudogleys and anthrosols.\nThe alluvial soils are young and pedologically undeveloped. They have a fine sandy texture and contain very few clayey particles. They are permeable and flowable. Fine sand reaches down to a depth of 100\u00a0cm; the gravel rarely reaches the surface. Where the water has filtered away there is arable land that offers favourable growing conditions, in particular where it is protected against flooding.\nBrown soils are the main soil type on the Ptujsko Polje. From a self-sufficiency point of view, they are strategically important for food production. This is made possible owing to the quality of the soils and the flatness of the terrain. The soils are of medium depth, have a medium humus content and are permeable and light-textured. Arable land predominates.\nThe brown, deep loam-based soils are situated on the edges of the Slovenske Gorice hills and the Pesnica valley, and loam is their primary constituent. These are deeper, more finely textured and less permeable soils. It is an area of intensive field-crop, grass and hop production.\nAnthrosols occupy the valley of the River Pesnica where it enters the Ptujsko Polje. Most of the land has been improved (in terms of drainage and agricultural use). The soils\u2019 physical and chemical properties have been modified. The soils have been aerated and rendered permeable by deep tillage, and the use of fertilisers has raised their pH so that they are no longer acid. Intensive cropping predominates on these soils.\nGeographically speaking, the Dravsko-Ptujsko Polje forms part of the Sub-Pannonian region of Slovenia. The climate in this geographical region may be described as the most markedly continental. It is not overly endowed with rainfall, the annual average in the 1961-2000 period being around 950\u00a0mm. Around Ptuj, most of the rain tends to fall in June, July and August (usually more than 100\u00a0mm per month), and the driest months are March, April and May (only 60-85\u00a0mm per month).\n\u2018Ptujski luk\u2019 must be harvested manually. This ensures the product\u2019s high quality. Another specific feature of \u2018Ptujski luk\u2019 is that individual onions are woven into traditional wreaths containing six or twelve onions of the same size and colour.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 is distinguished by its long-keeping quality and excellent culinary properties. It quickly disintegrates when cooked, yet retains its characteristic taste. Other characteristic features of \u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 are its cordate to oblate shape, the reddish colour of its skins and flesh, and its moderately pungent taste.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe link between \u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 and the area is based on the reputation it has acquired over many years and the long-standing traditional production method. \u2018Ptujski l\u00fck\u2019 is the common name for an onion which has been grown on the Ptujsko Polje for more than 200\u00a0years. The growing area has since time immemorial been called the \u2018onion-growing country\u2019 (l\u00fckarija), because onions (l\u00fck) are grown there. Anton Ingoli\u010d, who lived and worked hereabouts, wrote that onion-growing started at Dornava, the heart of onion-growing country, and spread from there throughout the Ptujsko Polje. All producers in Dornava \u2013 and throughout the Ptujsko Polje \u2013 have taken up onion-growing, in particular small and medium-sized farmers.\nOwing to the rainfall pattern, cereal rotation was the main form of farming to develop and become established on the Ptujsko Polje. Onion-growing is also ideal for incorporation into this rotation system. Onions do not need high temperatures in order to develop. As the sandy soils quickly dry out and heat up, the seed can therefore be sown and the sets planted very early in the year, when the days are still short. During the short-day season, the onions develop a strong root system, and then swell during the spring rains. This is followed by a hot and dry summer, which is necessary for the characteristic aroma (taste) to develop and, in particular, for drying the onions properly. The onions are therefore initially left to dry in the fields, the final stage of drying taking place on producers\u2019 premises. As agriculture, especially the growing of cereals (including rye), has been well developed in the geographical area since ancient times, the well-known tradition of weaving onions into rye-straw wreaths (strings) has also spread.\nIt is because of the dry weather during ripening and the shallow sandy, nutrient-poor soils that the onions have developed a more pungent taste.\nThe various stages in production and the method of producing the onions are reflected locally in a wealth of practices, customs, sayings, adages and traditional foods which have evolved and survived, as well as in the architectural features of houses, which had to have projecting roofs for the drying of onions. These practices live on and are maintained both as part of people\u2019s daily lives (special, still very popular foods, the drying of onions in yards under projecting roofs and the weaving of onion wreaths) and in connection with tourist events.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\u00a0(2)\nhttp://www.mko.gov.si/fileadmin/mko.gov.si/pageuploads/podrocja/Varna_in_kakovostna_hrana_in_krma/zasciteni_kmetijski_pridelki/Specifikacije/PTUJSKI_LUK_01.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No\u00a01151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\u00a0November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No\u00a01151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\u00a0November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
