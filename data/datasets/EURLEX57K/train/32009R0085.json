For this reason provisions should be established for such payments on account for the Structural Funds: 7,5\u00a0% (for Member States of the European Union as constituted before 1 May 2004) and 9\u00a0% (for the Member States that acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004) in order to accelerate the implementation of operational programmes.\n(11) By reason of the principles of equality of treatment and of legal security, the amendments relating to Articles 56(2) and 78(1) should apply during the whole 2007-2013 programming period. Retroactive application is therefore necessary with effect from 1 August 2006, the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 came into force. As the unprecedented crisis affecting international financial markets necessitates a rapid response in order to counter effects on the economy as a whole, other amendments should enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should therefore be amended,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 44, the second paragraph shall be amended as follows:\n(a) point (b) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) when the agreement is not a public service contract within the meaning of applicable public procurement law, the award of a grant, defined for this purpose as a direct financial contribution by way of donation to a financial institution without a call for proposals, if this is in accordance with a national law compatible with the Treaty;\u2019;\n(b) the following point (c) shall be added:\n\u2018(c) the award of a contract directly to the EIB or the EIF.\u2019;\n2. in Article 46(1), the following second subparagraph shall be added:\n3.
