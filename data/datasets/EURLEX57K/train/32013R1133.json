It originated in China, where its cultivation began in the 8th century. The cultivation of persimmons was introduced in Western Europe in the second half of the 19th century and in Spain in the 1870s. Today Spain\u2019s national production takes place principally in the Community of Valencia, where the area protected by the designation of origin \u2018Kaki Ribera del X\u00faquer\u2019 is located. Half of all production is concentrated in this area.\nThe \u2018Rojo Brillante\u2019 persimmon emerged by chance after seeds were sowed on the edge of a plot in the municipality of Carlet. Later, around 1960, the first homogeneous plantation was grafted in the municipality of Alcudia. This paved the way for the rapid development of the variety in the region.\nNatural\nRibera del X\u00faquer is a natural region in the Province of Valencia. It is surrounded by a large quaternary valley or alluvial plain through which the J\u00facar River (X\u00faquer in Valencian) and its tributary, the Magro, flow.\nMuch of the agricultural land is situated on the low plain on the banks of the J\u00facar and Magro, where the soils are very rich and compact owing to the build-up of alluvial deposits from the J\u00facar and its tributaries that flow down from the upland regions. Moreover, in the lower part of the valley slopes, where the incline is gentle, there are colluvial soils, pink in colour and loose, which particularly lend themselves to intensive cultivation.\nThe municipality enjoys a mild climate. The average annual temperature is 17\u00a0\u00b0C, with temperatures averaging 9-10\u00a0\u00b0C in January and 24-25\u00a0\u00b0C in August. Cloudy conditions are infrequent, and the average annual rainfall hardly exceeds 400 to 500\u00a0mm. In addition, the surrounding hills protect the crops from frost, especially in the tributary valleys.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe \u2018Rojo Brillante\u2019 is a native variety of the area. It is the result of the spontaneous mutation of another local variety and is therefore perfectly adapted to the region of Ribera del X\u00faquer, where full advantage is taken of the crop.\nPersimmons grown in the protected area have a greater height/diameter ratio and a more pointed shape. The \u2018Kaki Ribera del X\u00faquer\u2019 is distinguished by its pointed shape, which is slightly more elongated than normal. The height/diameter ratio is thus greater and this gives fruit obtained in the protected area a characteristic shape. In addition, they are larger on average than in other production areas owing to the mild climate and the absence of extreme temperatures.\nThe \u2018Kaki Ribera del X\u00faquer\u2019 also has a characteristic deep red colour and a sweet flavour at maturity, which is reached at an earlier stage thanks to the prevailing conditions in the area. The fruit may also be harvested before it is ripe. The method used to remove the bitterness makes it possible to market the fruit when its flesh is firm and very sweet and has acquired the typical taste of persimmons produced in the Ribera del X\u00faquer region.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nIt is said that the Ribera del X\u00faquer region is the cradle of the \u2018Rojo Brillante\u2019 persimmon, as that is where this variety emerged as a result of a spontaneous mutation. Nowadays it is well established in the region and on the market.\nThe particular climatic and soil conditions in the defined geographical area are reflected in the persimmon\u2019s characteristics.\nThe mild climate owing to the proximity of the Mediterranean Sea and the colluvial agricultural land resulting from the J\u00facar and Magro watercourses surrounding the region combine to endow the \u2018Kaki Ribera del X\u00faquer\u2019 with its principal distinctive characteristics, i.e. a more pronounced pointed shape leading to a greater height/diameter ratio as well as a larger size and a distinctive colouring when ripe.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttp://www.agricultura.gva.es/documents/170659/179611/030712+Pliego+de+condiciones+kaki+def.pdf/b354d4a8-425e-40fa-8e8b-0ae6d3588fe6\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
