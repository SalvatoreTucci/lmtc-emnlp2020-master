This results in outgoings on removals, transport, etc.;\nWhereas the United Kingdom Government is to contribute \u00a3 16 900 000 towards such costs borne by the NCB in 1983/84;\nWhereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 8 of the Decision;\nWhereas the aid given to cover losses on mining (\u00a3 415 000 000) will almost completely cover the losses sustained by NCB pits in 1983/84. The aid is given to avoid serious economic and social problems in those coalfields where there are not yet adequate re-employment opportunities and to maintain existing production capacities so as to safeguard energy supplies. The aid is therefore compatible with Article 12 of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the abovementioned aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in the 1983/84 financial year;\nWhereas aids for current production in the United Kingdom will amount to 719 900 000 ECU or 5,88 ECU per tonne for the 1983/84 financial year; whereas the British coal industry therefore receives the lowest subsidy of all coal-producing Member States;\nWhereas an examination of the compatibility of these aids with the proper functioning of the common market requires no detailed information or investigation:\n- there were no supply difficulties on the British market in 1983/84,\n- British coal exports to other Community countries fell slightly in 1983/84 compared with 1982/83,\n- the closure of 10 unprofitable pits resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest,\n- industrial consumers of coal did not receive indirect aids in 1983/84 as a result of the prices of British coking coal and steam coal;\nWhereas it can therefore be stated that the aids for the British coal industry for current production in the 1983/84 financial year are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this also applies when account is taken of aids to the coal industry pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC;\nIII\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ascertain that aids authorized are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must be informed in particular of the amount of these aids and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1983/84 financial year to grant aids totalling \u00a3 431 900 000 to the British coal-mining industry.\nThe said aids are made up as follows:\n1. Grant to cover the costs incurred by the National Coal Board in respect of relocation of personnel under the production rationalization programme, not exceeding \u00a3 16 900 000.\n2. Aid to cover losses on mining not exceeding \u00a3 415 000 000.", "The United Kingdom shall notify the Commission by 30 June 1984 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 September 1984.\nFor the Commission\n\u00c9tienne DAVIGNON\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 63, 11. 3. 1976, p. 1.\n(2) The 1983/84 financial year runs from the beginning of April 1983 to the end of March 1984."}
