For this reason Directive 72/462/EEC is no longer the appropriate legal basis for a decision allowing for warm-cutting. A new decision should therefore be adopted under Directive 64/433/EEC.\n(3) The authorities of Sweden, by letter of 15 July 2002, have presented to the Commission a request for a derogation from point 46(d) of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC for cutting fresh beef and pigmeat. This request proposes health conditions which are equivalent to those laid down in that paragraph.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding point 46(d) of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC, Sweden may authorise cutting of fresh beef and pigmeat under the conditions laid down in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 May 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 2012/64.\n(2) OJ L 243, 11.10.1995, p. 7.\n(3) OJ L 302, 31.12.1972, p. 28.\n(4) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\nANNEX\nSpecial conditions for cutting of bovine and pig carcases\n1. The carcases, originating from the slaughter floor, after chilling in refrigerating rooms operating with an air temperature at the outlet from the evaporators such that carcases can be cooled to an internal temperature of 7 \u00b0C within 48 hours for bovine carcases and 20 hours for pig carcases, are transported to the cutting premises, the temperature of which does not exceed 12 \u00b0C, located in the same group of buildings as the chillers.\n2. The meat is transferred in a single operation.\n3. The carcases are introduced into the cutting room and boned before an internal temperature of 7 \u00b0C has been achieved if the cutting is performed within 48 hours from the end of the slaughtering operations for bovine carcases and 20 hours for pig carcases.\n4. The time between meat entering the cutting room and being subjected to further refrigeration does not exceed 60 minutes.\n5. As soon as it is cut and packaged, the meat is transported to appropriate refrigerating rooms."}
