However, they are mainly used for professional applications and were found to be professional camera systems within the meaning of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. They should therefore be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000.\n(9) In accordance with the established Community institutions' practice, these television camera systems should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of the following cameras imported on or after 5 September 2005 should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from this date:\n\u2014 Camera head AK-HC910L,\n\u2014 Camera head AK-HC1500G,\n\u2014 Camera control unit AK-HRP900,\n\u2014 Camera control unit AK-HRP150.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camera heads DK-H31 and remote control panel RU-3300N\n(10) Camera head DK-H31 and remote control panel RU-3300N fall within the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. However, they are mainly used for professional applications and are not sold with the corresponding triax system or adaptor on the Community market. Therefore, it was concluded that they should be regarded as professional camera systems within the meaning of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. As a result, they should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000.\n(11) In accordance with the established Community institutions' practice, these television camera systems should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of the following cameras imported on or after 3 November 2005 should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from this date:\n\u2014 Camera head DK-H31,\n\u2014 Remote control panel RU-3300N.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INFORMATION OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND CONCLUSIONS\n(12) The Commission informed the Community industry and the exporters of the TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. None of the parties objected to the Commission's findings.\n(13) On the basis of the above, Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 shall be replaced by the Annex hereto.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall apply to imports of the following models produced and exported to the Community by the following exporting producers:\n(a) Matsushita from 5 September 2005:\n\u2014 Camera head AK-HC910L,\n\u2014 Camera head AK-HC1500G,\n\u2014 Camera control unit AK-HRP900,\n\u2014 Camera control unit AK-HRP150.\n(b) Hitachi from 3 November 2005:\n\u2014 Camera head DK-H31,\n\u2014 Remote control panel RU-3300N.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 19 June 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
