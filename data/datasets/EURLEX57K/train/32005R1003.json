It is also to include a definition, where relevant, of serotypes with public health significance.\n(4) That Regulation also provides that for a transitional period of three years, the Community target for breeding flocks of Gallus gallus is to cover the five most frequent salmonella serotypes in human salmonellosis, which are to be identified on the basis of data collected through Community monitoring systems.\n(5) The information from Community monitoring systems shows that the five most frequent salmonella serotypes in human salmonellosis are Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella hadar, Salmonella infantis, Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella virchow. The Community target established by this Regulation should therefore cover those serotypes.\n(6) In order to set the Community target, comparable data on the prevalence of the concerned salmonella serotypes in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus in Member States should be available. The minimum requirements for control of salmonella in accordance with Council Directive 92/117/EEC\u00a0(2) have been used as a basis for collecting the relevant data on prevalence in the Member States. Such information was collected during an appropriate period of time in all Member States in the year 2004.\n(7) In order to verify achievement of the target and taking into account the relatively low prevalence of the relevant salmonella serotypes in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus in the Community, it is necessary to organise repeated sampling of a representative number of flocks of a sufficient size, which should be 250 birds or more, as was required under Directive 92/117/EEC.\n(8) The testing scheme necessary to verify the achievement of the Community target is significantly different and likely to be more sensitive than the scheme that was used to collect comparable data in Member States pursuant to Directive 92/117/EEC. It is therefore necessary to provide for a review of the Community target after a maximum of one year of implementation of the corresponding national control programmes.\n(9) Due to that period of collection of information, comparable data were not available in time before the establishment of the Community target within the date laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 in relation to breeding flocks of Gallus gallus. The date of establishment of that target should therefore be extended with six months and Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures foreseen in Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 for the establishment of the Community target in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus during the transitional period are based on the methodology for controlling salmonella already established pursuant to Directive 92/117/EEC, and the remaining aspects of the measures relate to risk management. The measures provided for in this Regulation have been prepared in a working group with the participation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Without prejudice to the requirement to consult EFSA provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 on any matter that could have a significant impact on public health, a formal consultation of EFSA is not necessary at this stage.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Community target\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Community target for the reduction of Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella hadar, Salmonella infantis, Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella virchow in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus shall be a reduction of the maximum percentage of adult breeding flocks comprising at least 250 birds remaining positive to 1\u00a0% or less by 31 December 2009.\nHowever, for Member States with fewer than 100 breeding flocks, not more than one adult breeding flock shall remain positive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The testing scheme to verify the achievement of the Community target is set out in the Annex.", "Review\nThe Commission shall review the Community target set out in Article 1 in the light of the results of the first year of implementation of the national control programmes approved in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.", "Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, the text in column 4 of the first row is replaced by the following:\n\u201818 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\u2019", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 June 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 62, 15.3.1993, p. 38.

If the hatching eggs from a breeding flock occupy more than one incubator, then one such composite sample shall be taken from each incubator.\nIn cases where hatcher basket liners are not used, 10\u00a0g broken eggshells shall be taken from 25 separate hatcher baskets, crushed, mixed and a 25\u00a0g sub sample taken.\nThat procedure shall be followed for sampling at the initiative of the operator as well as for official sampling.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling at the holding\n2.2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Routine sampling at the initiative of the operator\nSampling shall primarily consist of faecal samples and shall aim to detect a 1\u00a0% within flock prevalence, with 95\u00a0% confidence limit. To that effect, the samples shall comprise one of the following:\n(a) Pooled faeces made up of separate samples of fresh faeces each weighing not less than 1 g taken at random from a number of sites in the building in which the birds are kept, or where the birds have free access to more than one building on a particular holding, from each group of buildings on the holding in which the birds are kept. Faeces may be pooled for analysis up to a minimum of two pools.\nNumber of birds kept in a building Number of faeces samples to be taken in the building or group of buildings on the holding\n250-349 200\n350-449 220\n450-799 250\n800-999 260\n1\u00a0000 or more 300\n(b) Five pairs of boot swabs:\n(c) In cage breeding flocks, sampling may consist of naturally mixed faeces from dropping belts, scrapers or deep pits, depending on the type of house. Two samples of at least 150 g shall be collected to be tested individually:\n(i) droppings belts beneath each tier of cages which are run regularly and discharged into an auger or conveyor system;\n(ii) droppings pit system in which deflectors beneath the cages are scraped into a deep pit beneath the house;\n(iii) droppings pit system in a step cage house when cages are offset and faeces fall directly into the pit.\n2.2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Official sampling\n(a) Routine sampling shall be as described in point 2.2.2.1.\n(b) Confirmatory sampling following detection of relevant salmonella from sampling at the hatchery shall be carried out as follows.\n(c) Suspect cases\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examination of the samples\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of the samples\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hatcher basket liners\n(a) place in 1 litre Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) which has been been prewarmed at room temperature and mix gently;\n(b) continue culture of the sample by using the detection method in 3.2.\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Boot swabs samples\n(a) carefully unpack the pair of boot swabs (or \u2018socks\u2019) to avoid dislodging adherent faecal material and place in 225 ml BPW which has been prewarmed to room temperature;\n(b) where five pairs of boot swabs are pooled into two samples, place five individual samples into a minimum of 225 ml BPW and ensure that all the samples are totally immersed in the BPW;\n(c) swirl to fully saturate the sample and continue culture by using the detection method in 3.2.\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other faecal material samples\n(a) at the laboratory place each sample (or pooled sample as appropriate) into an equal weight of Buffered Peptone Water and mix gently;\n(b) allow the sample to soften for 10-15 minutes then mix gently;\n(c) immediately after mixing remove 50\u00a0g of the mixture and add to 200\u00a0ml of Buffered Peptone Water which has been pre-warmed to room temperature;\n(d) continue culture of the sample by using the detection method in 3.2.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Detection method\nThe method recommended by the Community Reference Laboratory for Salmonella in Bilthoven, Netherlands, shall be used: the method is a modification of ISO 6579 (2002), where a semi solid medium (MSRV) is used as the single selective enrichment medium. The semi-solid medium should be incubated at 41,5 +/\u2013 1\u00a0\u00b0C for 2 \u00d7 (24 +/\u2013 3) hours.\nAs regards the boot swabs samples and other faecal material samples referred to in paragraph 3.1., it is possible to pool incubated BPW enrichment broth for future culture. To do that, incubate both samples in BPW as normal. Take 1\u00a0ml of incubated broth from each sample and mix thoroughly then take 0,1\u00a0ml of the mixture and inoculate the MSRV plates in the usual way.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serotyping\nAt least one isolate from each positive sample shall be typed, following the Kaufmann-White scheme.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results and reporting\nA breeding flock shall be considered positive for the purpose of verifying the achievement of the Community target, when presence of relevant salmonella (other than vaccine strains) was detected in one or more faecal samples (or if there is a secondary official confirmation in the Member State, in the relevant faecal samples or birds organ samples), taken at the holding. This shall not apply in exceptional cases of suspect breeding flocks where salmonella detection at the holding at the initiative of the operator was not confirmed by official sampling.\nThe cumulative results from sampling and testing in breeding flocks at holding level shall be accounted for, i.e. each breeding flock shall be counted only once irrespective of the number of sampling and testing operations. Positive breeding flocks shall be counted only once, irrespective of the number of sampling and testing operations.\nReporting shall include:\n(a) detailed description of the options implemented for the sampling scheme and the type of samples taken, as appropriate;\n(b) number of existing breeding flocks and those tested;\n(c) results of the testing;\n(d) explanations on the results, in particular concerning exceptional cases."}
