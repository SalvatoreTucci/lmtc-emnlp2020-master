Pursuant to Decision 2012/735/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion. The Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 March 2013.\n(2) Subsection 2 of Section B of Appendix 1 to Annex I to the Agreement concerns the tariff elimination schedule of the EU party for goods originating in Peru. For a number of specific products, it provides for the application of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to open tariff quotas for such products.\n(3) The tariff quotas should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(4) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of origin to the customs authorities, as provided for in the Agreement.\n(5) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(3), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 927/2012\u00a0(4), contains new CN codes which are different from those referred to in the Agreement. The new codes should therefore be reflected in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since the Agreement takes effect on 1 March 2013, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Union tariff quotas are opened for the goods originating in Peru and listed in the Annex.", "The customs duties applicable to imports into the Union of goods originating in Peru and listed in the Annex shall, within the respective tariff quota set out in the Annex to this Regulation, be suspended.", "The tariff quotas in the Annex shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with Articles 308a to 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 March 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 21.12.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0253, 11.10.1993, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0304, 31.10.2012, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the scope of the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by CN codes as they exist at the time of adoption of this Regulation.\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Quota period Annual quota volume\n09.7210 0201 Meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen From 1.3.2013 to 31.12.2013 1\u00a0792\u00a0(1)\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 2\u00a0365\u00a0(1),\u00a0(2)\n09.7211 0403\u00a090 Buttermilk, curdled milk and cream, kephir and other fermented or acidified milk and cream, whether or not concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured or containing added fruit, nuts or cocoa From 1.3.2013 to 31.12.2013 1\u00a0584\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12. 2\u00a0090\u00a0(3)\n09.7212 0405 Butter and other fats and oils derived from milk;
