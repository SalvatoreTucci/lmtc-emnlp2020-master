In this light, it is appropriate for the additional period of the designation of the Performance Review Body to end on 31 December 2016, in order not to pre-empt the outcome of that review process, which may lead to future changes in the tasks, designation and composition of that body. The end date of 31 December 2016 is also consistent with the reference period pursuant to Article 3(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 390/2013, insofar as it allows the Performance Review Body to finalise its work in relation to the adoption of performance plans for the second reference period (2015-19), to develop Union-wide performance targets with a view to their application as of 2017 in respect to determined unit cost for terminal air navigation services, and to assess in 2016 the traffic assumptions that were used to set Union-wide performance targets for the second reference period.\n(5) The Performance Review Commission of Eurocontrol, which at this point in time continues to be the most appropriate body to carry out those tasks, has expressed no objection to being designated as the Performance Review Body for an additional period. The chair and the members of this body, which were previously selected following the procedure laid out in Article 4(4) and 5(1) of Commission Decision of 29 July 2010, have also indicated their availability for a renewed term. Given the limited duration of the present additional period and the importance to ensure continuity in the beginning of the reference period, it is not appropriate to initiate a new selection procedure at this stage.\n(6) The designation of the Performance Review Body and the appointment of its chair and its members should therefore be renewed, for a period ending on 31 December 2016.\n(7) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, the Performance Review Body must be impartial, have appropriate competences when carrying out the tasks entrusted to it and act independently. Adequate safeguards should therefore be provided for in this regard. It should also be specified how this body is to report to the Commission.\n(8) In order to ensure its proper functioning, appropriate rules should be set out on the rules of procedure, the necessary voting requirements and the financing of the Performance Review Body.\n(9) In the interest of clarity, Commission Decision of 29 July 2010 and Commission Decision of 25 July 2013 should be repealed.\n(10) In order to ensure continuity, this Decision should enter into force on 1 July 2015.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee established by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,", "main_body": ["Designation of the Performance Review Body\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Performance Review Commission of Eurocontrol, supported by the performance review unit of the Eurocontrol agency, is designated as the Performance Review Body of the single European sky until 31 December 2016.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The designation is subject to the condition that the Performance Review Body maintains collective competence in the four key performance areas of safety, capacity, environment and cost-efficiency, and that sufficient, independent and competent support is provided to it by the Eurocontrol performance review unit.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When performing the duties entrusted to it by this Decision, the Performance Review Body, its chair and its individual members shall be impartial and shall exercise their functions with independence, avoiding conflicts of interests.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Performance Review Body shall be granted access to the performance-related data referred to in the Implementing Regulation (EU) No 390/2013, available within Eurocontrol.", "Reporting\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Performance Review Body shall act in full transparency and report directly to the Commission.
