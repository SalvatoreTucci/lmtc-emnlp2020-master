Sample preparation is made according to IDF-Standard 122B/1992. For acid casein, the sample preparation procedure described in IDF-Standard 73A/1985 may be used alternatively.\n2. Only tubes inoculated with 1 gram samples (butter) or 0,1 gram samples (skimmed milk powder, casein/caseinate) respectively, are incubated and evaluated. No decimal dilutions are made.\nEvaluation of results\n>TABLE>\nRemark\nColiform content: 1/10 g butter; 1/g skimmed milk powder or casein/caseinate on an average: results indicating that the requirement is fulfilled are obtained with a probability of 93 %.\nColiform content: 1/g butter; 1/0,1 g skimmed milk powder or casein/caseinate on an average:\nresults indicating that the requirement is not fulfilled are obtained with a probability of 91 %.\n(Assumption: Poisson-distribution)"}
