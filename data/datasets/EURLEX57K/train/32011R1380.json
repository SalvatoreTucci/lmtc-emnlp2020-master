That requirement is reflected in Part I of the relevant model veterinary certificate for day-old chicks laid down in Annex IV to Directive 2009/158/EC.\n(3) Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 sets out the specific conditions which apply to imports of ratites for breeding and production, hatching eggs and day-old chicks thereof. Those specific conditions do not currently include a similar provision concerning ratites as the one included for poultry in point 2 of Part II of Annex VIII to that Regulation.\n(4) Experience in the application of that provision concerning poultry shows that it is appropriate to extend it also to day-old chicks of ratites.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, in Part II, point 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.
