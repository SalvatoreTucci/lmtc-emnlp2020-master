That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article\u00a07(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136), as a feed additive for ducks, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article\u00a07(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed. The method of analysis referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is therefore not to be understood as a Community method of analysis within the meaning of Article\u00a011 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\u00a0(2).\n(5) The use of endo-1,4-beta xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136) was authorised without a time limit for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01206/2005\u00a0(3) and for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01259/2004\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 15\u00a0June 2006\u00a0(5) that the safety of this additive for the consumer, the user and the environment have already been established and will not be changed by the proposed new use. It further concluded, that the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on this additional animal category and that the use of that preparation can improve the zootechnical parameters in ducks. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6\u00a0March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.
