Indeed in certain cases, especially in Member States where only a small part of the national territory is used for agriculture and where consequently lower expenses are incurred for controlling outbreaks of harmful organisms, the amount of eligible expenditure per year was below the threshold of EUR 50\u00a0000.\n(4) A financial contribution should therefore also be granted for dossiers where the amount of eligible expenditure per year is substantially less than EUR 50\u00a0000.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002, the third sentence is replaced by the following:\n\u2018The financial contribution from the Community shall not be granted where the total amount of eligible expenditure per year, as referred to in Article 4(1), is less than EUR 25\u00a0000.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 January 2005\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
