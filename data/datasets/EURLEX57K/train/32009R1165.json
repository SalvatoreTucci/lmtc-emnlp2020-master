Paragraphs 27A and 27B are added.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE\nOther disclosures\nFair value\n27 An entity shall disclose for each class of financial instruments the methods and, when a valuation technique is used, the assumptions applied in determining fair values of each class of financial assets or financial liabilities. For example, if applicable, an entity discloses information about the assumptions relating to prepayment rates, rates of estimated credit losses, and interest rates or discount rates. If there has been a change in valuation technique, the entity shall disclose that change and the reasons for making it.\n27A To make the disclosures required by paragraph 27B an entity shall classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels:\n(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\n27B For fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position an entity shall disclose for each class of financial instruments:\n(a) the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety, segregating fair value measurements in accordance with the levels defined in paragraph 27A.\n(b) any significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. Transfers into each level shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level. For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities.\n(c) for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances, disclosing separately changes during the period attributable to the following:\n(i) total gains or losses for the period recognised in profit or loss, and a description of where they are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented);\n(ii) total gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income;\n(iii) purchases, sales, issues and settlements (each type of movement disclosed separately); and\n(iv) transfers into or out of Level 3 (eg transfers attributable to changes in the observability of market data) and the reasons for those transfers. For significant transfers, transfers into Level 3 shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of Level 3.\n(d) the amount of total gains or losses for the period in (c)(i) above included in profit or loss that are attributable to gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and a description of where those gains or losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented).\n(e) for fair value measurements in Level 3, if changing one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change fair value significantly, the entity shall state that fact and disclose the effect of those changes. The entity shall disclose how the effect of a change to a reasonably possible alternative assumption was calculated. For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities, or, when changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, total equity.\nLiquidity risk\n39 An entity shall disclose:\n(a) a maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities (including issued financial guarantee contracts) that shows the remaining contractual maturities.\n(b) a maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities. The maturity analysis shall include the remaining contractual maturities for those derivative financial liabilities for which contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows (see paragraph B11B).\n(c) a description of how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in (a) and (b).\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n44G Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7), issued in March 2009, amended paragraphs 27, 39 and B11 and added paragraphs 27A, 27B, B10A and B11A\u2013B11F. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. In the first year of application, an entity need not provide comparative information for the disclosures required by the amendments. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.\nAppendix A\nDefined terms\nThe following term is amended.\nliquidity risk The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.\nAppendix B\nApplication guidance\nA heading and paragraph B11 are amended. Paragraphs B10A and B11A\u2013B11F are added and paragraphs B12\u2013B16 are deleted. Paragraphs B12 and B13 are replaced by paragraph B11C(a) and (b). Paragraphs B14 and B16 are replaced by paragraph B11D.\nNature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments (paragraphs 31\u201342)\nQuantitative liquidity risk disclosures (paragraphs 34(a) and 39(a) and (b))\nB10A In accordance with paragraph 34(a) an entity discloses summary quantitative data about its exposure to liquidity risk on the basis of the information provided internally to key management personnel. An entity shall explain how those data are determined. If the outflows of cash (or another financial asset) included in those data could either:\n(a) occur significantly earlier than indicated in the data, or\n(b) be for significantly different amounts from those indicated in the data (eg for a derivative that is included in the data on a net settlement basis but for which the counterparty has the option to require gross settlement),\nB11 In preparing the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) an entity uses its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands. For example, an entity might determine that the following time bands are appropriate:\n(a) not later than one month;\n(b) later than one month and not later than three months;\n(c) later than three months and not later than one year; and\n(d) later than one year and not later than five years.\nB11A In complying with paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity shall not separate an embedded derivative from a hybrid (combined) financial instrument. For such an instrument, an entity shall apply paragraph 39(a).\nB11B Paragraph 39(b) requires an entity to disclose a quantitative maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities if the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. For example, this would be the case for:\n(a) an interest rate swap with a remaining maturity of five years in a cash flow hedge of a variable rate financial asset or liability.\n(b) all loan commitments.\nB11C Paragraph 39(a) and (b) requires an entity to disclose maturity analyses for financial liabilities that show the remaining contractual maturities for some financial liabilities. In this disclosure:\n(a) when a counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, financial liabilities that an entity can be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band.\n(b) when an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, an undrawn loan commitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down.\n(c) for issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called.\nB11D The contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analyses as required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, for example:\n(a) gross finance lease obligations (before deducting finance charges);\n(b) prices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash;\n(c) net amounts for pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are exchanged;\n(d) contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative financial instrument (eg a currency swap) for which gross cash flows are exchanged; and\n(e) gross loan commitments.\nB11E Paragraph 39(c) requires an entity to describe how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in the items disclosed in the quantitative disclosures required in paragraph 39(a) and (b). An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis of financial assets it holds for managing liquidity risk (eg financial assets that are readily saleable or expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities), if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.\nB11F Other factors that an entity might consider in providing the disclosure required in paragraph 39(c) include, but are not limited to, whether the entity:\n(a) has committed borrowing facilities (eg commercial paper facilities) or other lines of credit (eg stand-by credit facilities) that it can access to meet liquidity needs;\n(b) holds deposits at central banks to meet liquidity needs;\n(c) has very diverse funding sources;\n(d) has significant concentrations of liquidity risk in either its assets or its funding sources;\n(e) has internal control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk;\n(f) has instruments that include accelerated repayment terms (eg on the downgrade of the entity\u2019s credit rating);\n(g) has instruments that could require the posting of collateral (eg margin calls for derivatives);\n(h) has instruments that allows the entity to choose whether it settles its financial liabilities by delivering cash (or another financial asset) or by delivering its own shares; or\n(i) has instruments that are subject to master netting agreements.\nB12-B16 [Deleted]\nAmendment to International Financial Reporting Standard 4\nInsurance Contracts\nParagraph 39(d) is amended.\nDISCLOSURE\nNature and extent of risks arising from insurance contracts\n(d) information about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk that paragraphs 31\u201342 of IFRS 7 would require if the insurance contracts were within the scope of IFRS 7. However:\n(i) an insurer need not provide the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) of IFRS 7 if it discloses information about the estimated timing of the net cash outflows resulting from recognised insurance liabilities instead. This may take the form of an analysis, by estimated timing, of the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position.\n(ii) \u2026"}
