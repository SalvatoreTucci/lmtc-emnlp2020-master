Aid shall be granted in accordance with the terms of contracts concluded with intervention agencies ; such contracts shall express the reciprocal obligations of the contracting parties in standard terms for each product.", "Unless specially authorised, a request for private storage aid may only be made in the country where the product is to be stored.", "If the market situation so requires, the period of storage specified in the contract may be curtailed or extended under conditions to be determined.", "1. The amount of aid shall be either:    - determined by means of an invitation to tender published in the Official Journal of the European Communities ; or\n- fixed in advance ; in this case the entitlement under Article 14 (3) (b) (aa) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 may be substituted wholly or partially for the aid.\n2.
