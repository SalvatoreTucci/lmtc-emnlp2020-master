Therefore Decision 2001/494/EC should be repealed.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The schemes submitted by the United Kingdom and Ireland for the withdrawal of all fish in farms situated in their territory and infected with infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) are approved.", "Decision 2001/494/EC is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 175, 19.7.1993, p. 23.\n(2) OJ L 99, 10.4.2001, p. 11.\n(3) OJ L 180, 3.7.2001, p. 34."}
