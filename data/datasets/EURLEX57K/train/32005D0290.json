Decision 2004/639/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) Equivalence has been recognised with regard to public health requirements for pig meat but not for animal health requirements. Therefore the simplification based on equivalence of the model certificate for pig meat should only cover public health measures.\n(6) Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing\u00a0(7) provides that the health certificates accompanying meat to be imported from a third country be supplemented by an attestation certifying that animals referred to in that Directive have been slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to those provided for in that Directive. That attestation should be included in the model certificate for fresh pig meat set out in this Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Member States shall authorise the importation from Canada of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species conforming to the certification conditions laid down in the model certificate set out in Annex I, and accompanied by such a certificate duly completed and issued before departure of the consignment from Canada.", "The Member States shall authorise the importation from Canada of fresh meat of domestic swine conforming to the certification conditions laid down in the model certificate set out in Annex II, and accompanied by such a certificate duly completed and issued before departure of the consignment from Canada.", "In Article 1 of Decision 2004/639/EC, the following paragraph 4 is added:\n\u20184.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirement laid down in paragraph 1 to use the model animal health certificate set out in Annex II, part 1 shall be without prejudice to specific certification requirements and model certificates adopted pursuant to agreements between the Community and third countries following a recognition of equivalence.\u2019", "For a transitional period not exceeding 90 days from the date of application of this Decision, Member States shall authorise the importation from Canada of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species and fresh meat of domestic swine under model certificates applicable before the date of application of this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 April 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 71, 18.3.1999, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 22.7.1988, p. 10.
