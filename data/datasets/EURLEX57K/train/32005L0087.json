Lead accumulates to some extent in kidney and liver tissue, muscle tissues contain very low residual amounts of lead and carry-over into milk is limited. Therefore foods of animal origin are not a major source of human exposure to lead.\n(5) Cattle and sheep seem to be the most sensitive animal species with respect to acute lead toxicity. Individual intoxications have been reported, resulting from ingestion of feed material originating from polluted areas or accidental ingestions of lead sources. However, the levels found in commercial feed materials in the European Union do not induce clinical signs of toxicity.\n(6) The existing legal provisions as regards lead in products intended for animal feed are generally appropriate to ensure that these products do not represent any danger to human health, animal health or adversely affect the livestock production.\n(7) Cattle and sheep seem to be the most sensitive animal species and green fodder is a major component of their daily ration, it is important to provide for a review in view of a possible further reduction of the maximum level of lead in green fodder.\n(8) In addition the establishment of a maximum level of lead for additives belonging to the functional group of trace elements, binders and anti-caking agents and for premixtures is appropriate. The maximum level established for premixtures takes into account the additives with the highest level of lead and not the sensitivity of the different animal species to lead. In order to protect animal and public health, it is therefore the responsibility of the producer of premixtures to ensure that, in addition to compliance with the maximum levels for premixtures, the instructions for use on the premixture are in accordance with the maximum levels for complementary and complete feedingstuffs.\n(9) The Scientific Panel on contaminants in the Food Chain of the EFSA adopted an opinion on a request from the Commission related to fluorine as undesirable substance in animal feed on 22 September 2004.\n(10) Fluoride accumulates particularly in calcifying tissues. In contrast, transmission into edible tissues including milk and eggs is limited. Hence, the fluoride concentrations in foods from animal origin contribute only marginally to human exposure.\n(11) In the European Union, fluoride levels in pastures, herbages and compound feeds are generally low and subsequently exposure of animals to fluoride is generally below the level causing detrimental effects. However, in certain distinct geographic areas and incidentally in the proximity of industrial sites with high fluoride emission, excessive exposure to fluoride is associated with dental and skeleton abnormalities.\n(12) The existing legal provisions as regards fluorine in products intended for animal feed are appropriate to ensure that these products do not represent any danger to human health, animal health or adversely affect the livestock production.\n(13) The extraction procedure used has a large influence on the analytical result and it is therefore appropriate to determine the extraction procedure. Equivalent procedures with demonstrated equal extraction efficiency can be used.\n(14) The level for fluorine in marine crustaceans such as marine krill has to be amended in order to take into account new processing techniques to improve the nutritional quality and to reduce the biomass loss but which also results in higher levels of fluorine in the final end product.\n(15) Commission Directive 84/547/EEC of 26 October 1984 amending the Annexes to Council Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs\u00a0(3) establishes a maximum level for fluorine in vermiculite (E 561). The scope of Directive 2002/32/EC provides for the possibility of the establishment of maximum levels of undesirable substances in feed additives and the rules governing undesirable substances should be collected in a single text for greater clarity.\n(16) The Scientific Panel on contaminants in the Food Chain of the EFSA adopted an opinion on a request from the Commission related to cadmium as undesirable substance in animal feed on 2 June 2004.\n(17) Contamination of food with cadmium is of public health concern. Accumulation of cadmium in animal tissue is function of dietary concentration and duration of exposure. The short life span of animals like fattening pigs and poultry minimizes the risk of undesirable cadmium concentrations in edible tissues of these animals Ruminants and horses however may be exposed during their entire lifespan to cadmium present in pastures. In distinct regions this may result in an undesirable cadmium accumulation particularly in kidneys.\n(18) Cadmium is toxic to all animal species. In most of the domestic animal species, including pigs which are considered the most sensitive species, gross clinical symptoms are unlikely to occur if dietary cadmium concentrations remain below 5 mg/kg feed.\n(19) The existing legal provisions as regards cadmium in products intended for animal feed are appropriate to ensure that these products do not represent any danger to human health, animal health or adversely affect the livestock production.\n(20) No maximum level is currently established for pet food and feed materials of mineral origin other than phosphates. It is appropriate to establish a maximum level for these products intended for animal feed. It is appropriate to amend the current maximum level for cadmium for fish feed in order to take into account recent developments in formulating fish feed incorporating higher ratios of fish oil and fishmeal. In addition the establishment of a maximum level of cadmium for additives belonging to the functional group of trace elements, binders and anti-caking agents and for premixtures is appropriate. The maximum level established for premixtures takes into account the additives with the highest level of cadmium and not the sensitivity of the different animal species to cadmium. As provided in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, in order to protect animal and public health, it is the responsibility of the producer of premixtures to ensure that, in addition to compliance with the maximum levels for premixtures, the instructions for use on the premixture are in accordance with the maximum levels for complementary and complete feedingstuffs.\n(21) Directive 2002/32/EC and Directive 84/547/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(22) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Without prejudice to the other conditions for the authorisation of the additive vermiculite, belonging to the group of binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants, laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC, the maximum fluorine content shall be as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive 12 months after the entry into force at the latest.
