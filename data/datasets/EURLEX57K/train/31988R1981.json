whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/86 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1754/88 (3), lays down certain provisions for the implementation of the said Regulation;\nWhereas trade with third countries under the outward processing relief arrangements is governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2473/86 of 24 July 1986 on outward processing relief arrangements and standard exchange arrangements (4); whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2458/87 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 4151/87 (6), lays down certain provisions for the implementation of the said Regulation;\nWhereas save as otherwise provided in the Act of Accession or in Protocol 3 thereto, customs legislation in force for trade with third countries must, in accordance with Articles 51 (1) and 211 (1) of the abovementioned Act and Article 9 (1) of the said Protocol, apply on the same terms to trade within the Community for such time as customs duties are levied in such trade;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 296/86 (7) provides for certain adjustments to Council Directive 69/73/EEC of 4 March 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of inward processing (8) and Council Directive 76/119/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of outward processing (9);

whereas, however, these Regulations will cease to be used for processing of Community goods from 1 January 1993, when customs duties on imports are due to be finally abolished under the Act of Accession;\nWhereas it is necessary to provide for certain adaptations to the inward processing relief arrangements in order to allow for the use of the suspension system and the release for free circulation of the compensating products obtained in all cases;\nWhereas, for the sole purposes of the present Regulation, the restrictions provided for in Section II of Chapter 1 of Title II of the Fourth Part of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal may be treated as specific commercial policy measures provided for in Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2458/87; whereas in accordance with that Article these measures are not applied where the compensating products obtained under the outward processing arrangements and released for free circulation originate in the Community;
