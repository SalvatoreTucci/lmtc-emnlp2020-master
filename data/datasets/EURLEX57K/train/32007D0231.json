The Decision may however be confirmed for additional periods in accordance with Article 13(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC.\n(3) In the light of the experience acquired so far and the absence of a permanent Community act on the safety of lighters, it is necessary to confirm the validity of the Decision for a further 12 months.\n(4) Decision 2006/502/EC bans the placing on the market of non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters as of 11 March 2007. After that date, however, non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters may still be supplied to consumers until stocks are exhausted. Since non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters pose a serious risk, the supply of such lighters to consumers should be prohibited.\n(5) The shortest possible transitional periods should be allowed for the application of the measures established by this Decision, consistent with the need to prevent further accidents while taking into account technical constraints and ensuring proportionality. Transitional periods are also required for the Member States to ensure that the measures are efficiently applied. Consequently, the ban on supplying non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters to consumers should apply one year after the date of application of the ban on placing such products on the market.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend Decision 2006/502/EC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/502/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
