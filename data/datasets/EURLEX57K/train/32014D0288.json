The structure of the relevant reports should therefore be adapted for the electronic submission and processing of data.\n(7) Therefore, the standard requirements for the submission by Member States of applications for Union financing for the national programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses should be amended and made consistent with the amendments to relevant Union legislation and compatible with the on-line submission system.\n(8) In the second half of each year, the Commission requests from the Member States to provide updated information on the usage of funds for eligible measures under their programmes since the beginning of the year and estimations for the total needed budget for the whole year. On the basis of this information and in order to improve the usage of available funds the Commission prepares every year a Decision amending the financing decision for that year to reallocate funds between programmes that are expected not to use their initial allocation of funds and programmes reported to be in need of additional funds.\n(9) In order to optimise the efficiency of the exercise of reallocating funds amongst programmes, it is appropriate that the Member States also submit quantitative information on the activities already performed and expected to be performed, as well as unit cost data. Furthermore, to reduce administrative burden the submission of information for the reallocation of funds should be integrated within the submission of intermediate reports.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate that Decision 2008/940/EC is repealed and replaced by the current Decision.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Member States shall, in accordance with this Decision, submit intermediate and final reports as regards programmes approved pursuant to Article 27 of
