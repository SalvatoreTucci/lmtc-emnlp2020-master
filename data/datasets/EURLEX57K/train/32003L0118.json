These Decisions provided that plant protection products containing these active substances shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community.\n(2) In order to allow legitimate expectations to be fulfilled for existing stocks of pesticides to be used, the Commission Decisions cited in recital 1, allowed a phasing-out period, and it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community should not apply until the end of the phasing-out period applying to that substance.\n(3) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius(12) are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for acephate and parathion-methyl. These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established.\n(4) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of those plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.\n(6) MRLs for parathion-methyl should be set in Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. Provisions of Directive 76/895/EEC which set MRLs for that substance should consequently be deleted.\n(7) Where no Community MRL or provisional community MRL exists, as is the case for 2,4-D on citrus by Commission Directive 2002/97/EC(13), Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised. Data have been submitted by a Member State that demonstrated that a higher MRL can be set for citrus, reflecting the use of 2,4-D in some third countries. Data have been submitted showing that these residues do not pose a risk to consumers in the Community.\n(8) The relevant Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entries relating to parathion-methyl shall be deleted.", "In part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following rows are added:\n\">TABLE>\"", "In part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are added:\n\">TABLE>\"", "Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
