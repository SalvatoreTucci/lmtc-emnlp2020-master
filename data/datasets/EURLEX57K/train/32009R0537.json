In the light of new applications and information received by the Commission from third countries since the last publication of the list, certain modifications should be taken into consideration and added or inserted in the list.\n(2) The Australian and Costa Rican authorities have asked the Commission to include a new control and certification body. The Australian and Costa Rican authorities have provided the Commission with the necessary guarantees to satisfy it that the new control and certification bodies meet the criteria laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.\n(3) The duration of inclusion of India in the list provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 expires on 30 June 2009. In order to avoid trade disruption, there is a need to prolong the inclusion of India in that list for a further period. The Indian authorities have asked the Commission to include four new control and certification bodies. The Indian authorities have provided the Commission with the necessary guarantees to satisfy it that the new control and certification body meets the criteria laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008. The Indian authorities have informed the Commission that one control body has changed its name.\n(4) The Israeli authorities have informed the Commission that one control body has changed its name.\n(5) Certain agricultural products imported from Tunisia are currently marketed in the Community pursuant to the transitional rules provided for in Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008. Tunisia submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list provided for in Annex III to that Regulation. It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the Tunisian authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Commission has carried out an on-the-spot check of the rules of production and the control measures actually applied in Tunisia, as provided for in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 189, 20.7.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 334, 12.12.2008, p. 25.\nANNEX\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n1. in point 5 of the text relating to Australia the following indent is added:\n\u2018\u2014 AUS-QUAL Pty Ltd, www.ausqual.com.au\u2019;\n2. in point 5 of the text relating to Costa Rica the following indent is added:\n\u2018\u2014 Control Union Certifications, www.cuperu.com\u2019;\n3. the text relating to India is amended as follows:\n(a) point 5 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 Aditi Organic Certifications Pvt.
