The request states that the aforementioned Directorate has the necessary staff, equipment and facilities to carry out checks, that it uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from Senegal to the Community must meet the Community marketing standards.\n(3) The information sent by the Member States to the Commission shows that, in the period 2001 to 2005, the incidence of non-conformity with marketing standards among imports from Senegal of fresh fruit and vegetables was very low.\n(4) Checks on conformity carried out by Senegal should therefore be approved with effect from the date of implementation of the administrative cooperation procedure provided for in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Checks on conformity with the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruit and vegetables carried out by Senegal prior to import into the Community are hereby approved in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001.", "Details of the official authority and inspection body in Senegal, as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001, are given in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the date of publication in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union of the notice referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001, relating to the establishment of administrative cooperation between the Community and Senegal.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 March 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.
