whereas these duties are to be reduced to 62,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1988; whereas, by derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/86 of 24 February 1986 concerning the basic duties to be adopted in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal (1) provides that the basic duties are those which actually have been applied on 1 January 1986; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the import of these products, a Community tariff quota should be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1988 for 1 900 tonnes of dried grapes originating in Spain and falling within codes 0806 20 11, 0806 20 19, ex 0806 20 91 and ex 0806 20 99 of the combined nomenclature at the duty shown in the table in Article 1;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade im agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question, originating in Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quotas are only applicable in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;\nWhereas from 1 January 1988 the Nomenclature used under the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized System of Commodity Description and Coding System;\nWhereas this Regulation should take into account this fact by including the Combined Nomenclature Codes relevant to the products in question;\nWhereas it is in particularly necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports from Spain over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports into each of the Member States were as follows:\n(tonnes)\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member States  // 1984   // 1985  // 1986   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 2   // 26  // 6   // Denmark   // 5   // 3,1   // -   // Germany   // 3  // 3   // 4   // Greece   // -   // -   // -   // Spain   // -   // -   // -   // France   // 80   // 103   // 43   // Ireland   // -   // 1   // 1   // Italy   // 7   // 14,9   // 6 1985, p. 7.\nWhereas in the last three years the products in question were only imported regularly by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be allocated to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports take place in the latter; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the combined nomenclature;\nWhereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover the subsequent requirements of these Member States where they have used up their initial share and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should, under the circumstances, be fixed at 40 % of the quota volume;\nWhereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional share is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota amounts have been used up and to inform Member States thereof;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,", "main_body": ["From 1 January to 31 December 1988, on import into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985, the duty for the following products shall be totally suspended within the limits of a Community tariff quota as follows:\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CN code  // Description  // Amount of quota (tonnes)   // Rate of duty (%)   //    //   //   //   //   // 09.0303   //   // Grapes, fresh or dried   // 1 900   // free   //   //   //  Dried:  //   //   //   //   //   In immediate containers of a net capacity not exceeding 2 kg:   //   //   //   // 0806 20 11  //    Currants   //   //   //   // 0806 20 19   //    Other  //   //   //   //   //   Other   //   //   //   // ex 0806 20 91   //    Currants in immediate containers of a net capacity of 15 kg or less   //   //   //   // ex 0806 20 99   // Other in immediate containers of a net capacity of 15 kg or less   //   //   //    //   //   //   //", "1.
