Under Article 8 of that Regulation, on each Thursday the Commission must record the level of market prices in each Member State, based on the prices communicated by them.\n(2) As these rules require buying-in under a tendering procedure to be opened or suspended immediately after the second consecutive recording of a market price that is below or alternatively equal to or above 92 % of the intervention price, the decision to do so is not a matter of discretion and so must be taken by the Commission as quickly as possible, without having recourse to the management procedure laid down in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.\n(3) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 is replaced by the following: \"Article 2\n1.
