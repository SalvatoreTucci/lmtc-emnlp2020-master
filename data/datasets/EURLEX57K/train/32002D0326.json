In accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the single programming document includes the following elements:\n(a) the strategy and priorities for the joint action of the Structural Funds and the Member State; their specific quantified targets; the ex ante evaluation of the expected impact, including on the environmental situation, and the consistency of the priorities with the economic, social and regional policies and the employment strategy of Flanders (Belgium).
