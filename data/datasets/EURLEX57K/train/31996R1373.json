whereas this could prevent application of the special arrangements; whereas it is therefore necessary, pending the conclusion of new agreements with the countries in question, to make transitional adjustments to the abovementioned Commission Regulations while maintaining the essential parts of the arrangements concerned;\nWhereas levies are now replaced by customs duties and the reductions granted to third countries must be applied to the customs duties applicable from 1 July; whereas, in order not to prejudice the interests of the exporter countries, it is also necessary to replace the reduction of the component designed to protect the Community industry by a fixed reduction of the import duty;\nWhereas the rates of duty set out in the common customs tariff for imports of husked rice falling within CN code 1006 20 and milled rice falling within CN code 1006 30 are those applicable on the date referred to in Article 67 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (11);\nWhereas, to ensure the correct application of the arrangements involving the collecting of an export charge, the import duty must be fixed in advance; whereas, therefore, the possibility of fixing the applicable duty on the date of submission of the import licence application should be maintained;\nWhereas the security provided for in Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1029/96 (13), to cover imports carried out with advance fixing should be increased;\nWhereas Regulation (EC) No 2123/95 lays down temporary measures until 30 June 1996 to facilitate the transition from the abovementioned special import arrangements;\nWhereas Regulation (EC) No 1193/96 extends the period for transitional measures until 30 June 1997; whereas the measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2123/95 should be extended until 30 June 1997;\nWhereas, however, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3877/86 (14), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3130/91 (15), on imports of rice of the long-gain aromatic Basmati variety applies until 30 June 1996; whereas it is therefore no longer necessary to provide for transitional measures for these arrangements;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Rice,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2942/73 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
