It lays down certain transitional measures, including a prohibition on the dispatch from Cyprus to other Member States and third countries of certain meat and meat products derived from ovine and caprine animals. That Regulation applies until 30 April 2007.\n(2) The results of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) eradication and monitoring programme for 2006 in the Community indicate that in Cyprus, 865 cases of TSE in sheep were diagnosed, out of the total of 2\u00a0579 TSE cases in the Community, and 461 TSE cases in goats were diagnosed, out of the total of 531 TSE cases in the Community.\n(3) In the framework of the TSE roadmap (COM(2005) 322 final) adopted on 15 July 2005 and in line with the SANCO work programme 2006-2007 on TSEs (SEC(2006) 1527), the Commission is currently discussing with the Member States on a proposal to review the current measures to apply in TSE affected flocks where BSE has been excluded.\n(4) Due to the animal health situation in Cyprus in sheep and goat populations with regard to scrapie, taking control requirements into account and awaiting the conclusions of the discussion on a review of the current eradication measures it is necessary to maintain certain protection measures as regards the intra-Community trade and trade with third countries with certain meat and meat products derived from ovine and caprine animals in order to prevent the risk of the disease in other Member States.\n(5) The dispatch of products derived from ovine and caprine animals in Cyprus to other Member States and the export thereof to third countries should therefore continue to be prohibited.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Cyprus shall ensure that fresh meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products, as defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), derived from ovine and caprine animals are not dispatched from that Member State to other Member States or exported to third countries.", "This Decision shall apply until 31 October 2007.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Cyprus."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.
