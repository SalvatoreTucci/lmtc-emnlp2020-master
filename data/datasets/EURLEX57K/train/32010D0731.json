In view of the experience gained in the implementation of the Directive and the information already obtained through the first questionnaire, this questionnaire focuses on the changes and progress made by Member States in the actual implementation of the Directive.\nIn order to ensure continuity and enable direct comparisons to be made to previous responses, this questionnaire does not change the general approach contained in Decision 2006/329/EC. In those cases where questions are similar to those of the previous questionnaire, reference can simply be made to the previous answers where the situation is unchanged. If there have been new developments, these should be described in a new answer.\nAs for the first questionnaire, the Commission intends to make use of the ReportNet platform (or its successor if this is the case) to make available to Member States an Electronic Reporting Tool based on this questionnaire. Accordingly, the Commission strongly recommends its use for fulfilling this reporting requirement in order to reduce burdens and streamline the analysis of the responses.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number of plants and permits\n1.1.
