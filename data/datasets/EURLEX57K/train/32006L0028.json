Directive 70/156/EEC was amended accordingly by that Directive.\n(5) Since then it has become obvious that the way to provide these data can be simplified for 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and that it is unnecessary for monitoring purposes to require information about the use of 79 GHz short-radar equipment in the Certificate of Conformity (CoC) in addition to the information about the 24 GHz short range radar equipment, since the 79 GHz band does not interfere with other applications and its use is not restricted. It is therefore appropriate to modify requirements related to the use of 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and delete requirements related to the use of 79 GHz short-range radar equipment in Directive 72/245/EEC. This Directive does not affect the validity of existing approvals for vehicles not fitted with 24 GHz short range radars.\n(6) Only Technical Services issue attestations according to the model given in Annex III C of Directive 72/245/EEC. No further authority or administration is involved in this process. Therefore, the additional stamping of the attestation presently required is dispensable and shall be removed.\n(7) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The amendments to Directive 72/245/EEC have an impact on Directive 70/156/EEC. It is therefore necessary to amend Directive 70/156/EEC accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Directive 72/245/EEC\nDirective 72/245/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
