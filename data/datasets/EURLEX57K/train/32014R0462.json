That application was accompanied by the information required by the second subparagraph of Article 23(3).\n(2) The Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) for scientific assistance. The Authority presented to the Commission a Technical report on the substance concerned on 24 May 2013\u00a0(2). The Commission presented the review report and this draft regulation on the approval of Equisetum arvense L. to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 20 March 2014.\n(3) The documentation provided by the applicant and the results of examination carried out by the Authority\u00a0(3) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) show that Equisetum arvense L. fulfils the criteria of a foodstuff as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5). Moreover, it is not predominantly used for plant protection purposes but nevertheless is useful in plant protection in a product consisting of the substance and water. Consequently, it is to be considered as a basic substance.\n(4) As the basic substance concerned is a foodstuff not requiring a specific authorisation under Regulation (EC) No\u00a0178/2002, it is deemed to be evaluated as having neither an immediate or delayed harmful effect on human or animal health nor an unacceptable effect on the environment.\n(5) It has appeared from the examinations made that Equisetum arvense L. may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to include certain conditions for the approval which are detailed in Annex I to this Regulation.\n(6) In accordance with Article 23(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, basic substances are to be listed separately in the Regulation referred to in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is therefore appropriate to add a Part C in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\u00a0(6). That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Approval of a basic substance\nThe basic substance Equisetum arvense L., as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 the second paragraph is replaced by the following two paragraphs:\n\u2018The active substances approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are as set out in Part B of the Annex to this Regulation.
