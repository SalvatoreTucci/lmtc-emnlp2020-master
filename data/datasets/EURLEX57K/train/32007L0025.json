That list includes dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb.\n(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For dimethoate, the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 4 August 2004. For dimethomorph and metribuzin, the rapporteur Member State was Germany and all relevant information was submitted on 11 June 2004 and 23 august 2004 respectively. For glufosinate, the rapporteur Member State was Sweden and all relevant information was submitted on 3 January 2003. For phosmet, the rapporteur Member State was Spain and all relevant information was submitted on 23 August 2004. For propamocarb, the rapporteur Member State was Ireland and all relevant information was submitted on 5 October 2004.\n(3) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 March 2005 for glufosinate, on 12 May 2006 for phosmet and propamocarb, on 23 June 2006 for dimethoate and dimethomorph, and on 28 July 2006 for metribuzin, in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports\u00a0(4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 24 November 2006 in the format of the Commission review reports for dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb.\n(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points concerning dimethoate, glufosinate, metribuzin and phosmet. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that dimethoate, glufosinate, metribuzin and phosmet should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for some issues and that such studies should be presented by the notifiers.\n(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92\u00a0(5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 31 March 2008 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

On the basis of that evaluation, they shall determine whether the product satisfies the conditions set out in Article 4(1)(b), (c), (d) and (e) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\nFollowing that determination Member States shall:\n(a) in the case of a product containing dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb as the only active substance, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30 September 2011 at the latest; or\n(b) in the case of a product containing dimethoate, dimethomorph, glufosinate, metribuzin, phosmet and propamocarb as one of several active substances, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30 September 2011 or by the date fixed for such an amendment or withdrawal in the respective directive or directives which added the relevant substance or substances to Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, whichever is the latest.", "This Directive shall enter into force on 1 October 2007.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
