That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of propionic acid, sodium propionate and ammonium propionate as feed additives for all animal species to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019, functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019. The application includes also other uses of the same substances for which no decision has yet been taken.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 16 November 2011\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, propionic acid, sodium propionate and ammonium propionate do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It was also concluded that the substances improve the aerobic stability of easy to ensile materials. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the substances concerned shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those substances should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The substances specified in the Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(12):2446.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of technological additives.
