The analysed concentration corrected for recovery and the expanded measurement uncertainty subtracted from the analytical result is used to assess compliance. This procedure is only applicable in cases where the method of analysis enables the estimation of measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery (eg. Not possible in case of microscopic analysis)\n(a) corrected or uncorrected for recovery, the manner of reporting and the level of recovery being indicated;\n(b) as \u201cx +/- U\u201d, whereby x is the analytical result and U is the expanded measurement uncertainty, using a coverage factor of 2 which gives a level of confidence of approximately 95\u00a0%.\u2019"}
