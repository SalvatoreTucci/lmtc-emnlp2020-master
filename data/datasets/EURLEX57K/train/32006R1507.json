As a result of the addition of the use of pieces of oak wood to the list of authorised oenological practices in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, restrictions on and conditions for the use of this material should be laid down. The restrictions and conditions laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the rules approved by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2001 of 24 April 2001 laying down detailed rules of application concerning the documents accompanying the carriage of wine products and the records to be kept in the wine sector\u00a0(3) lays down rules on the information to be provided in accompanying documents and the keeping of inwards and outwards registers, and provides in particular for the indication of certain operations in the records. The particular characteristics of the use of pieces of oak wood in wine require this use to be indicated in the accompanying documents and the records.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 of 29 April 2002 laying down certain rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products\u00a0(4) lays down the conditions for using indications concerning the production method. The use of pieces of oak wood in winemaking gives the product a woody flavour similar to that of wines produced in oak casks. It is therefore difficult for the average consumer to determine which of the two methods has been used. Using pieces of oak wood in winemaking is extremely financially attractive to wine producers, and affects the selling price of the product. There is a risk of misleading consumers if the labelling of a wine made using pieces of oak wood contains terms or expressions which may lead them to believe that it has in fact been produced in oak casks. To avoid misleading consumers, and to prevent any distortion of competition between producers, appropriate labelling rules should be laid down.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

They may not have undergone any chemical, enzymatic or physical processes other than heating. No product may be added for the purpose of increasing their natural flavour or the amount of their extractible phenolic compounds.\nLABELLING\nThe label must mention the origin of the botanical species of oak and the intensity of any heating, the storage conditions and safety precautions.\nDIMENSIONS\nThe dimensions of the particles of wood must be such that at least 95\u00a0% in weight are retained by a 2 mm mesh filter (9 mesh).\nPURITY\nThe pieces of oak wood may not release any substances in concentrations which may be harmful to health.\nThis treatment is to be recorded in the register referred to in Article 70(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX X\nIndications authorised for use on wine labelling pursuant to Article 22(3)\n\u201cbarrel fermented\u201d \u201cbarrel matured\u201d \u201cbarrel aged\u201d\n\u201coak-cask fermented\u201d \u201coak-cask matured\u201d \u201coak-cask aged\u201d\n\u201ccask fermented\u201d \u201ccask matured\u201d \u201ccask aged\u201d\u00a0\u2019"}
