It should, therefore, be amended to include such a statement. Similarly, Article 35 of that Regulation should be amended to make it possible to make payments throughout the year for the measures referred to in that Article.\n(4) The procedures for amendments to programmes provided for in Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 need to be more precise. It is appropriate to specify the rules for the submission of the requests for amendments to the overall programmes and for their approval by the Commission, as well as the timing for their application. Due to budgetary rules, the approved amendments should be implemented as from 1 January of the year following the request for amendment. Moreover, there should be a distinction between major amendments requiring approval by a Commission Decision and minor amendments that should only be notified to the Commission for information.\n(5) The time limit of 90 days for the aid to be paid by the competent authorities after the date on which the utilised aid certificate is lodged as provided for in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 is too long and leads to certain administrative difficulties. It should, therefore, be reduced to 60 days.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1914/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
