In this case, crisis management and prevention measures can include market withdrawals as referred to in Article 103c(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and in Article 75 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 to stabilise producer prices.\n(3) In accordance with Article 79(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011, Annex XI to that Regulation sets out the maximum amounts of support for market withdrawals for the products referred thereto. Those amounts have to be fixed so as to avoid that withdrawals become a permanent alternative outlet for products compared to placing them on the market and to ensure at the same time that withdrawals remain an effective instrument for crisis prevention and management.\n(4) In the light of the prevailing market situation for peaches and nectarines and in order to mitigate the impact of a sudden drop in prices this summer, the maximum amounts of support for market withdrawals for peaches and nectarines should be adjusted.\n(5) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) It is appropriate to apply the new amounts of support as from 19 July 2011 onwards, the date around which the significance of the drop in prices for peaches and nectarines became apparent. This Regulation should therefore enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(7) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Annex XI to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 19 July 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX XI\nMaximum amounts of support for market withdrawals as referred to in Article 79(1)\n(EUR/100\u00a0kg)\nProduct Maximum support\nCauliflowers 10,52\nTomatoes 7,25\nApples 13,22\nGrapes 12,03\nApricots 21,26\nNectarines 26,90\nPeaches 26,90\nPears 12,59\nAubergines 5,96\nMelons 6,00\nWatermelons 6,00\nOranges 21,00\nMandarins 19,50\nClementines 19,50\nSatsumas 19,50\nLemons 19,50\u2019"}
