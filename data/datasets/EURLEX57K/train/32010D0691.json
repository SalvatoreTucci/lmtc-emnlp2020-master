This file shall contain an economical analysis showing that there is a substantial economical and/or technical advantage in putting ERTMS into service at a later date for equipment rather than during the course of the EU-funded project.\n(4) The Commission shall analyse the file submitted and the measures proposed by the Member State and shall inform the committee referred to in Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) of the result of its analysis. When a derogation is granted, the Member State shall ensure that ERTMS is installed at the latest 5 years after the end of the project and as soon as the section of the line is connected to another ERTMS equipped line.\n(5) The line Stran\u010dice\u2013\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice will be gradually upgraded until 2016, whereby some sections are or will be receiving financial support from European Regional Development Funds and/or Cohesion Funds.\n(6) The line Stran\u010dice\u2013\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice is shorter than 150\u00a0km and is not connected to an already ERTMS equipped line. On 24 January 2010, the Czech authorities sent a request for derogation to the Commission together with a file showing that there is a substantial economical and technical advantage in putting ERTMS into service by the end of 2018 rather than during the course of the EU-funded project.\n(7) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), the European Railway Agency provided its technical opinion on the request for derogation on 20 May 2010.\n(8) This technical opinion indicated that the file submitted contains the elements required for a derogation but suggested to obtain confirmation that the tender would contain an option for the ERTMS equipment of the line.\n(9) The Czech authorities confirmed on 7 June 2010 that the tender for the last subsection will contain a clear option for the ERTMS equipment of the line.\n(10) The Commission informed the Committee set up by Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC of the result of its analysis,", "main_body": ["The derogation from the obligation to implement the TSI control command and signalling of the trans-European conventional rail for the line Stran\u010dice\u2013\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice requested by the Czech Republic is hereby granted.\nThis derogation is granted until 31 December 2018.", "This Decision is addressed to the Czech Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 November 2010.\nFor the Commission\nSiim KALLAS\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 284, 16.10.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 25.7.2009, p. 60.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 18.7.2008, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 164, 30.4.2004, p. 1."}
