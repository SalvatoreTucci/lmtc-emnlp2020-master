Mr Andry Nirina RAJOELINA\nPresident of the High Transitional Authority\nof the Republic of Madagascar\nAntananarivo\nMadagascar\nSir,\nThe European Union (\u2018EU\u2019) attaches great importance to the essential elements set out in Article 9 of the Partnership agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 and revised in Luxembourg on 25 June 2005, hereinafter \u2018the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement\u2019, concerning respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which underpin the ACP-EU Partnership.\nThe EU therefore reacted immediately to the forcible transfer of power that occurred in Madagascar on 17 March 2009 and took the view that it constituted a flagrant violation of the essential elements set out in Article 9 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement.\nActing under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the EU entered into a political dialogue with the ruling regime, which led to the opening of consultations with a view to assessing the situation and possible solutions for a rapid return to constitutional order. At the opening meeting of these consultations, which were held in Brussels on 6 July 2009, the EU did not consider that any satisfactory proposals had been made by the Malagasy side.\nIn a spirit of openness to dialogue and taking full account of the complexity of the political situation in Madagascar, the EU proposed that the consultations remain open in order to encourage Madagascar\u2019s High Transitional Authority to continue negotiations with Madagascar\u2019s political factions under the aegis of the joint mediation team made up of the African Union (\u2018AU\u2019), the Southern African Development Community (\u2018SADC\u2019), the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the United Nations, in order to arrive at a consensus that would permit a return to constitutional order.\nUnder the aegis of this joint mediation team for Madagascar, and particularly after the appointment of Mr Chissano at the SADC Summit in June 2009, on 9 August 2009, the leaders of the four political factions signed, in Maputo, the Maputo Political Agreement and the Charter of the Transition, plus other agreements providing, in particular, for the creation of the institutions to manage the transition process and organise presidential and legislative elections over the next fifteen months. These agreements, which were to be implemented over the ensuing thirty days with appointments to key posts in the transition institutions made by consensus, have been supplemented by the Additional Act to the Malagasy Charter of the Transition, which was signed by the leaders of the four political factions on 6 November 2009 in Addis Ababa.\nDespite the many efforts of the joint mediation team with the support of the international community over the last few months, and despite the most recent ad hoc initiative of the President of the AU Commission, the political factions have not been able to reach agreement on the implementation of the transition process to which they agreed in Maputo and in Addis Ababa. Rather, Mr Rajoelina has embarked upon a unilateral transition process, including the appointment of a Prime Minister and a government and the organisation of elections for 2010, which runs counter to both the spirit and the letter of the Maputo Agreements and the Addis Ababa Charter.\nIn light of the foregoing, the EU has decided to close the consultation period and has decided under Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement to adopt the appropriate measures described below:\n\u2014 Humanitarian and emergency aid is not affected.\n\u2014 Budgetary aid provided for in the National Indicative Programmes (\u2018NIP\u2019) of the 9th European Development Fund (\u2018EDF\u2019) and 10th EDF shall be suspended.\n\u2014 Projects and programmes already under way under the 9th EDF shall continue to be implemented except for activities and payments directly involving the government and its agencies. Modifications and addenda to current contracts shall be examined on a case-by-case basis. New contracts shall be suspended.\n\u2014 The implementation of the NIP \u2013 10th EDF shall be suspended.\n\u2014 The European Commission may implement certain projects and programmes that directly benefit the population,\n\u2014 Regional projects shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2014 The European Commission reserves the right to assume immediately, wholly or partially, the functions of National Authorising Officer for the EDF.\n\u2014 The political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement shall be maintained and conducted, as far as possible, in coordination with the International Contact Group on Madagascar. It may be stepped up if a consensus-based solution for a return to constitutional order is reached, which includes 1) a consensual arrangement for a transitional government; 2) the setting-up of a clear roadmap towards election, which is acceptable to the involved parties and which allows for a free and fair election campaign; 3) fair elections, recognised as such by the international community and which can provide democratic legitimacy to a new Government. The EU will continue to monitor closely developments in Madagascar and may give its support to, if applicable, the implementation of a consensual political solution to the crisis.\nThese appropriate measures shall be adopted for an initial period of twelve months.\nThe EU reserves the right to examine and revise the measures mentioned above in order to take into consideration any developments, positive or negative, in the situation in Madagascar.\nWe wish to assure you, Mr President, of our highest consideration.\nFor the European Union\nThe Commission\nThe Council"}
