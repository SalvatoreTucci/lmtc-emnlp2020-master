Although the cost of each tonne produced increased owing to the substantial impact of labour costs on the total costs, the combined effect of the reduction in output and the  increase in coal prices resulted in a reduction in the overall amount of aid for 1991 as compared to 1990.\nThe aid proposed will cover the difference between the projected average costs and the projected average revenue for each tonne produced. The aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence complies with the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1)  of the Decision.\nThe gradual closure that this measure allows will facilitate the execution of regional development programmes and hence contribute to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third  indent of Article 2 (1).\nIn view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities, the aid to be granted to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry in 1991 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market.\nIII\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it authorizes is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 3 and 6 thereof. It must therefore be informed of  the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["Portugal is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Esc 803 777 000 to the coal industry to cover operating losses for the 1991 calendar year.", "The Portuguese Government shall inform the Commission at the latest by 30 June 1992 of the actual amount of aid paid in 1991.", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 December 1991.
