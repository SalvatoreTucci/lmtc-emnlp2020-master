The European Union will, at the time of the signature make the following declaration:\n\"The European Union states that it is in a process of development of an area of freedom, security and justice, which may have consequences that affect the Agreements with the United States. These developments will be considered carefully by the Union in particular as regards Article 10(2) of the Extradition Agreement. The Union will wish to consult with the United States in order to find solutions to any developments affecting the Agreements, including, if needed, through revision of the Agreements. The Union states that Article 10 does not constitute a precedent for negotiations with third states.\"\n(5) The Agreements foresee in their Article 3(2) that written instruments be exchanged between the United States of America and the Member States of the Union on the application of bilateral treaties. Article 3(3) of the Agreement on mutual legal assistance provides a similar obligation for those Member States that do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States.
