GENERAL REMARKS\nThis programme relates to the whole of the Portuguese fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Portugal.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the fleet to 209 140 GRT and 544 508 kW;\n(b) to redeploy fishing activities in coastal areas towards more distant and deeper waters;\n(c) to introduce better measures to support and monitor fishing operations and the development of the fleet;\n(d) to modernize existing vessels without increasing the individual tonnage and engine power of the vessels.\n2. The following limitations should apply to the development of the fleet during the period covered by the programme:\n(Tonnage (GRT))\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // Objective of programme 2908/83   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987   // Objective at 31. 12. 1991  //    //   //   //   // 1.

In case of modification, the objectives of 31 December 1991 will be adopted.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES\n(a) A redeployment of the capacity of the 'local' fleet and the coastal fleet of less than 9 metres between perpendiculars registered on the continent.\n(b) Redeployment of the coastal fleet of above 9 metres between perpendiculars and registered on the continent, by withdrawal of obsolete and unsuitable vessels and by encouraging the use of more selective fishing methods.\n(c) Redeployment of the fleet registered in the Azores and Madeira to the benefit of operational units:\n- on various sedentary species in waters of the archipelago,\n- on highly migratory species in waters which are not under Portuguese sovereignity.\n(d) Restructuring of the deep sea fleet by the use of more flexible fishing vessels but which in the present state of external resources and the forseeable evolution in the medium term of fishing relations must involve a reduction in the fishing capacity of this fleet (and principally) of boats or the distant water fishery).\nMoreover, the modernization actions should lead, in priority to the use of selective fishing year and to the improvement of conservation and processing of fish on board.\nFinally, a particular emphasis should be given to the improvement of working. IV. COMMENTS\n1. The overall objective referred to in point II (1) (a) above can only be revised on the basis of detailed scientific assessments showing the existence of stocks which are not fully exploited at present. In the light of experimental fishing this figure will be adjusted during the course of the period 1987 to 1989 up to a maximum limit of 7 000 GRT.\n2. With regard to the Portuguese coastal fleet, a certain increase in tonnage and of individual power of boats may be taken into consideration at the time of the realization of the programme for reasons of safety of navigation, the improvement of working conditions and the conservation of existing resources in coastal zones. Such an increase when it occurs should not disturb the equilibrium with the resources susceptible to being exploited by it.\n3. It is imperative that the redeployment of fishing activities referred to in point II (1) (b) above be accompanied by the introduction of regulations to ensure that fishing activities in the waters traditionally fished by the 'inshore fleet' are curtailed and that an analysis be made of the impact of such redeployment measures on the exploitation of coastal stocks before those measures are implemented.\n4. At least 20 % of the programme objectives should be achieve by the end of 1988 and at least 80 % by the end of 1990.\n5. The Commission recalls that structural financial measures taken by the national, regional or local authorities in respect of the sector concerned must henceforth lie within the scope of this programme."}
