This has been confirmed by an additional examination made by CEN experts. The Machinery Working Group consulted on this matter during its meeting of 4 December 2000 confirmed that the solutions as provided for in EN 848-3 reflect the current state of the art. This examination has also concluded that further research on the means of protection needs to be carried out and therefore, the arguments presented by Sweden relating to clause 5.2.7.1.2 of EN 848-3 must be taken into consideration for the revision of this standard,", "main_body": ["The references of standard EN 848-3 \"Safety of woodworking machines - One-side moulding machines with rotating tool - Part 3: Numerical control boring machines and routing machines\", adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) in July 1999, shall not be withdrawn from the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
