From the date on which this Regulation enters into force until 31 January 1987, the Common Customs Tariff duty for deep-frozen fillets and minced blocks of Alaska pollack (Theragra chalcogramma) falling within Common Customs Tariff subheadings ex 03.01 B II b) 17 and ex 03.01 B I n) 2 shall be suspended at a level of 5 % within the limit of a Community tariff quota of 4 000 tonnes.\n2.

If a Member State, after exhausting its second share has used 90 % or more of the third share drawn by it, that Member State shall, in the manner and to the extent provided in paragraph 1, draw a fourth share equal to the third.\nThis process shall apply until the reserve is used up.\n4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Member State may draw shares lower than those specified in those paragraphs if there are grounds for believing that those specified may not be used in full.

Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that additional shares drawn pursuant to Article 3 are opened in such a way that imports may be charged without interruption against their aggregate shares of the Community tariff quota.\n2. Member States shall ensure that importers of the product in question have free access to the shares allotted to them.\n3. Member States shall charge imports of the product in question against their shares as the product is entered with the customs authorities for free circulation.\n4.
