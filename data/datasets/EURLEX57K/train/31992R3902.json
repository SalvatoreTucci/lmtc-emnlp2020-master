Should the use of the margin of tolerance provided for in Article 12 (1) (a) of the basic  Regulation lead to the fixing of different withdrawal price levels for the same product category by  producers' organizations established in a given area, each of these organizations may adopt the  price level fixed by another producers' organization in the same area with effect from the date it  becomes applicable and for the relevant period.\n3.  The withdrawal price level fixed by a producers' organization using the margin of tolerance  shall apply to all the quantities offered for sale by that organization or its members, including  those offered for sale outside its area of activity.\nHowever, any producers' organization or one of its members, selling its products in an area other  than its own area of activity, may apply either its own withdrawal price level which must not be  lower than the price level in the zone concerned or one of those adopted, after eventual  application of the margin of tolerance, by the producers' organizations established in that area.\n4.  The withdrawal price shall not include expenses incurred after landing of the products with the  exception of those, including transport costs, made necessary by auction or quayside sales.", "1.  Any producers' organization applying the margin of tolerance to the Community  withdrawl price shall communicate to the competent authorities of the Member State in which it is  recognized the level of the withdrawal price adopted for each category of products in all parts of  its area of activity, at least two working days before it is to become applicable.\nIf a producers' organization intends to change the period of application of the margin of tolerance  or the level of the withdrawal price, or make use of the option provided for in Article 2 (2), it  shall inform the competent authorities thereof at least two working days before the date of  application of its decision.\nAll decisions referred to in this Article shall apply for five working days at least.\n2.
