The proposed measure is therefore adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for harmonised standards.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 February 2000.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30.8.1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nFlat and curved glass panels (including basic glass, processed glass, special or safety glass, coated, filmed, enamelled, surface-treated or mirrored glass):\nFor all uses other than:\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance,\n- for use as anti-bullet or anti-explosion glazing.\nChannel-shaped glass (wired or unwired):\nFor all uses other than:\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance.\nInsulating glass units:\nFor all uses other than:\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance,\n- for use as anti-bullet or anti-explosion glazing.\nGlass blocks:\nFor use in non-load bearing applications other than:\n- for anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses.\nGlass-block wall panels:\nFor all non-load bearing uses other than:\n- for fire compartmentation uses,\n- for anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses.\nANNEX II\nFlat and curved glass panels (including basic glass, processed glass, special or safety glass, coated, filmed, enamelled, surface-treated or mirrored glass):\n- for anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses,\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance.\nChannel-shaped glass (wired or unwired):\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance.\nInsulating glass units:\n- for anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses,\n- for use in a glazed assembly intended specifically to provide fire resistance.\nGlass blocks:\nfor anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses.\nGlass-block wall panels:\n- for fire compartmentation uses,\n- for anti-bullet and anti-explosion uses.\nANNEX III\nNote:\nfor products having more than one of the intended uses specified in the following families, the tasks for the approved body, derived from the relevant systems of attestation of conformity, are cumulative.\nPRODUCT FAMILY\nFLAT GLASS, PROFILED GLASS AND GLASS-BLOCK PRODUCTS (1/6)\n1.
