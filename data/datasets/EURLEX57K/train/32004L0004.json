These substances were considered by the Scientific Committee on Food not acceptable as previous cargoes and therefore should be removed from the list of acceptable previous cargoes.\n(4) In the case of methyl esters of fatty acids (laurate, palmitate, stearate, oleate), acetic anhydride, ammonium polyphosphate, propylene tetramer, propyl alcohol, sodium silicate, in view of data available, the assessment of the Scientific Committee on Food has resulted in the acceptance of these substances as previous cargoes. These substances should be therefore added to the list of acceptable previous cargoes.\n(5) In the case of iso-decanol, iso-nonanol, iso-octanol, montan wax, paraffin wax and white mineral oils the information available was inadequate to carry out a complete evaluation. However, according to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food, these substances may be considered as provisionally acceptable as previous cargoes considering their unlikely genotoxic potential, their easy removal by tank cleaning procedures and the very low residues expected as a result of these factors and their likely dilution.\n(6) These provisionally acceptable substances should be reassessed on the basis of new scientific data and the Annex reviewed as appropriate within an adequate period of time. The data needed for the above evaluation should be provided, in particular, by relevant food business operators.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 96/3/EC is replaced by the Annex hereto.", "The substances iso-decanol, iso-nonanol, iso-octanol, montan wax, paraffin wax and white mineral oils, shall be reassessed on the basis of new scientific data and the Annex reviewed as appropriate by 31 December 2006.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 June 2004 at the latest.
