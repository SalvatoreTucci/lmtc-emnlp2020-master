Article 8(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1443/82 of 8 June 1982 laying down detailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 392/94(4), provides that the amount referred to in Article 36(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 shall be fixed at the same time as the production levies and in accordance with the same procedure.\n(2) For the 2000/01 marketing year, the maximum amount of the B levy has been fixed for sugar at 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar. It has transpired that the amount of the B levy for sugar to be charged for the said marketing year is only 20,7308 % of the intervention price for white sugar. This difference requires, in accordance with Article 36(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999, that the amount to be paid by sugar manufacturers to beet sellers should be fixed per tonne of beet of the standard quality and at the rate of 60 % of the said difference.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The amount referred to in Article 36(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 to be paid by sugar manufacturers to beet sellers in respect of the B levy shall be fixed for the 2000/01 marketing year at EUR 8,27 per tonne of beet of the standard quality.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 October 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 127, 9.5.2001, p. 28.\n(3) OJ L 158, 9.6.1982, p. 17.\n(4) OJ L 53, 24.2.1994, p. 7."}
