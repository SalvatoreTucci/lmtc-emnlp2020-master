Annex III to that Directive sets out a table listing treatments that can be applied to products of animal origin in order to eliminate the animal health risks linked to meat and milk. Those treatments are in line with the treatments recommended in the relevant chapters of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE Terrestrial Code).\n(3) In the Chapter on foot-and-mouth disease of the OIE Terrestrial Code, a treatment has been included which ensures the inactivation of the foot-and-mouth disease virus in meat.\n(4) That treatment should therefore be included in the list of treatments in the Table set out in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC as effective to eliminate the risk of foot-and-mouth disease in meat.\n(5) In addition, the reference to \u2018sheep and goat plague\u2019 in the Table set out in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC should be replaced by \u2018peste des petits ruminants\u2019 in order to reflect the official denomination of that disease in the OIE Terrestrial Code. Furthermore, the number \u20181\u2019 in the title of the table should be deleted and the mention \u2018MEAT\u2019 before the treatments for milk should be replaced by \u2018MILK\u2019.\n(6) Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX III\nTreatments to eliminate certain animal health risks linked to meat and milk\n+ : Effectiveness recognised.\n0 : Effectiveness not recognised.\nMEAT Disease\nFoot-and-mouth disease Classical swine fever Swine vesicular disease African swine fever Rinderpest Newcastle disease Avian influenza Peste des petits ruminants\n(a) Heat treatment in a hermetically sealed container with an F0 value of 3,00 or more\u00a0(2)\n(b) Heat treatment at a minimum temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C, which must be reached throughout the meat\n(ba) Thorough cooking of meat, previously deboned and defatted, subjected to heating so that an internal temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C or greater is maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes\n(c) Heat treatment at a minimum temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C which must be reached throughout the meat\n(d) Heat treatment in a hermetically sealed container to at least 60\u00a0\u00b0C for a minimum of 4 hours, during which time the core temperature must be at least 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes\n(e) Natural fermentation and maturation of not less than nine months for boneless meat, resulting in the following characteristics: Aw value of not more than 0,93 or a pH value of not more than 6,0\n(f) Same treatment as in (e) above although meat may contain bone\u00a0(1)\n(g) Salami: treatment in accordance with the criteria to be defined by the Article 12(2) procedure following an opinion by the relevant Scientific Committee\n(h) Hams and loins: treatment involving natural fermentation and maturation during at least 190 days for hams and 140 days for loins\n(i) Heat treatment ensuring a core temperature of at least 65\u00a0\u00b0C is reached for the time necessary to achieve a pasteurisation value (pv) equal to or more than 40\nMILK Disease\nFoot-and-mouth disease Classical swine fever Swine vesicular disease African swine fever Rinderpest Newcastle disease Avian influenza Peste des petits ruminants\nMILK and milk products (including cream) for human consumption\n(a) Ultra-high temperature (UHT)\n(b) If the milk has a pH of less than 7,0, simple high temperature \u2014 short-time pasteurisation (HTST)\n(c) If the milk has a pH of 7,0 or more, double HTST\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0All the necessary measures must be taken to avoid cross contamination.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0F0 is the calculated killing effect on bacterial spores.
