It provides that detailed rules, required by the epidemiological situation to supplement the minimum control measures provided for in that Directive, are to be laid down. The date for the transposition of that Directive into the national law of the Member States is 1 July 2007.\n(2) Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC\u00a0(4) lays down certain protection measures to be applied in order to prevent the spread of that disease, including the establishment of areas A and B following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of the disease. Those areas are listed in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC and include parts of the Czech Republic, Hungary and the United Kingdom.

That Decision applies until 30 June 2007. As Directive 2005/94/EC is to be transposed into the national law by the Member States by 1 July 2007, the measures provided for therein will replace the measures currently provided for in Decision 2006/416/EC.\n(4) As outbreaks of the avian influenza virus of the subtype H5N1 continue to occur, the measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC should continue to apply where that virus is detected in poultry, thereby supplementing the measures provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC.\n(5) Given this epidemiological situation, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of Decision 2006/415/EC until 30 June 2008.\n(6) In addition, the references in Decision 2006/415/EC to Decision 2006/416/EC should be replaced by references to Directive 2005/94/EC.\n(7) Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/415/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
