That difference is based on transport costs that are considerably less than those used for calculating import duties. On the basis of market information, it would appear that the advantage of proximity is offset by logistical disadvantages created by transport, storage and loading infrastructures and that, in practice, freight costs over the long term are equivalent. On the basis of experience, it appears that the existence of this supplementary import duty has the effect of creating flow difficulties to the market. The reduction of EUR 10 per tonne provided for in Article 4 should therefore be abolished. The situation will be reassessed before the next marketing year.\n(2) Article 3 of and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lay down the quality criteria to be respected on imports to the Community. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1908/84(5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2507/87(6), laid down the reference methods for the determination of the quality of cereals. This Regulation was repealed as a consequence of the abolition of the standard qualities for cereals. It is therefore necessary to refer to the analytical methods laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 of 19 April 2000 establishing procedures for the taking-over of cereals by intervention agencies and laying down methods of analysis for determining the quality of cereals(7).\n(3) The footnote in Annex II lays down that where no quotation is available that can be used to calculate a representative cif import price, fob quotations publicly available in the United States of America may be used. However, that provision is difficult to apply, since internal transport costs in the USA cannot be taken into account. The footnote must therefore be amended to take account of those transport costs.\n(4) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 4(2) is replaced by the following: \"2.
