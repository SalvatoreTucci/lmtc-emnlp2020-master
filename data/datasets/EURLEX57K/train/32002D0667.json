This procedure is based on statistical principles. An essential element of this procedure is the use of a typical process standard deviation of the fat content of butter made according to a defined specification in a specified production plant and known in advance by the control authorities in Member States where the declaration for release into free circulation in the Community is presented. The identification of the factories and the corresponding typical process standard deviation are contained in Commission Decision 2001/651/EC(5).\n(2) The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Food Assurance Authority (MAF Food) by letter dated 5 July 2002 notified the Commission of new registered factory names and in some cases new registered factory numbers.
