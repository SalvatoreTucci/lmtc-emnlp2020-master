(\u2026)\u2019 referring to a specific location where the algae are grown, namely, Whyalla. However, in the last years, global demand on algal carotenes has increased and further saline lakes have been established in Australia and in other countries. There is no mention or any restriction about the location(s) where Dunaliella salina is grown in the current Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives\u2019 specifications for algal carotenes\u00a0(5) and the European Food Safety Authority\u2019s opinion on the re-evaluation of mixed carotenes (E 160a (i)) and beta-carotene (E 160a (ii)) as a food additive\u00a0(6). Therefore, in order to avoid market disruption, the description of Algal Carotenes (E 160a (iv)) in the specifications should be amended.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 contains errors in the specifications for Calcium Bisulphite (E 227) and Potassium Bisulphite (E 228). Those errors should be corrected.\n(9) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 lays down specifications also for Microcrystalline Cellulose (E 460(i)) which indicate that the synonym for this food additive is Cellulose gel. Since the Codex Alimentarius adopted a dual name for Microcrystalline Cellulose (E 460(i)), its designated INS name is \u2018Microcrystalline cellulose (Cellulose gel)\u2019. Taking into account previous practice\u00a0(7) and in order to ensure consistency, and to avoid any disruption in trade, the dual name of Microcrystalline Cellulose, Cellulose Gel should be adopted for the food additive (E 460(i)). Accordingly, the name \u2018Cellulose gel\u2019 should be removed from the entry \u2018Synonyms\u2019 in the specifications for that food additive and its name should be amended accordingly in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(10) The food additive \u2018Carboxy methyl cellulose, Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, cellulose gum\u2019 (E 466) should be renamed as \u2018Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, Cellulose gum\u2019 in the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and in the specifications for this additive for the purpose of clarity and in order to align it with its registered name in the INS.\n(11) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except if the updates in question are not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the updates in the Union lists referred to above are not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "The food additives \u2018Brilliant Black BN, Black PN\u2019 (E 151) or \u2018Carboxy methyl cellulose, Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, Cellulose gum\u2019 (E 466) and foods containing those food additives, labelled or placed on the market up to twenty four months after the entry into force of this Regulation and which do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation, may be marketed until the stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0International Numbering System for Food Additives (INS).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Monograph 4 (2007) on CAROTENES (Algae) available at http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/Monograph1/Additive-114.pdf\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS); Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Mixed Carotenes (E 160a (i)) and beta-Carotene (E 160a (ii)) as a food additive.
