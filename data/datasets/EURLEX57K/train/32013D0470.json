Annexes III and IV to that Decision set out the relevant model health certificates.\n(2) Commission Decision 2010/472/EU\u00a0(3) lays down, inter alia, certification requirements for the importation into the Union of consignments of semen and of ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species. Part 2 of Annex II and Part 2 of Annex IV to that Decision set out the relevant model health certificates.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in bovine, ovine, and caprine animals. Chapter A of Annex VIII to that Regulation lays down the conditions for intra-Union trade in live animals, semen and embryos. In addition, Annex IX to that Regulation lays down the conditions for the importation of live animals, embryos, ova and products of animal origin into the Union.\n(4) In the light of new scientific evidence, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 was amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 630/2013\u00a0(5). The amendments to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lift most of the restrictions with regards to atypical scrapie. They also further align to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards the rules relating to intra-Union trade in and imports of ovine and caprine animals and their semen and embryos to reflect a stricter approach as regards classical scrapie.\n(5) The model health certificates for intra-Union trade in consignments of semen and of ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species set out in Annexes III and IV to Decision 2010/470/EU and the model health certificates for imports into the Union of consignments of semen and of ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species set out in Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU should therefore be amended in order to reflect the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Regulation (EU) No 630/2013.\n(6) Decisions 2010/470/EU and 2010/472/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) To avoid any disruption of trade in and imports into the Union of consignments of semen and of ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species, the use of health certificates issued in accordance with Decision 2010/470/EU and Decision 2010/472/EU in their versions prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the
