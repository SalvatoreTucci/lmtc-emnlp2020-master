Consequently, the annual peak in pet movements could result in numerous administrative difficulties.\n(4) It is therefore advisable to maintain as necessary the application of the national conditions currently in force for a sufficient period of time. As a consequence, during this period movements shall be allowed in conformity either with Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 or with national rules which were in force before 3 July 2004. Accordingly, the derogation from Commission Decisions 2003/803/EC\u00a0(2) and 2004/203/EC\u00a0(3), provided for in Commission Decision 2004/301/EC, as regards the format for certificates and passports to be used for the non-commercial movement of dogs, cats and ferrets should be postponed.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Without prejudice to the second paragraph of Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, Member States shall allow entry into their territory until 1 October 2004 of pet animals of the species listed in Annex I to that Regulation in conformity with national rules which were in force before 3 July 2004.", "In Article 1, first paragraph, point (a), of Decision 2004/301/EC, the date \u20183 July 2004\u2019 is replaced by the date \u20181 October 2004\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 13.6.2003, p. 1.
