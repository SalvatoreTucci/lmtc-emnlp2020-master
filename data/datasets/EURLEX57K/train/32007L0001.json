However, as it is not obvious that 4-amino-3-fluorophenol belongs to that aniline family a specific entry for that substance should be included in Annex II.\n(4) For the sake of clarity, the substance epoxiconazole should be moved from the separate reference number 1182 to reference number 663 in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(5) As no new further scientific data were submitted to the SCCP before 31 July 2006 for the evaluation of N,N\u2032-dihexadecyl-N,N\u2032-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)propanediamide, that substance should be included in Annex II.\n(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall ensure that with effect from 21 February 2008, cosmetic products which fail to comply with this Directive are not sold or disposed of to the final consumer.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 21 August 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
