Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared in 2003 and since then is considered a potential high threat for public health. High pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses pose a serious risk to individuals and the evolution towards a potential pandemic influenza. West Nile virus infection in humans has been recently reported by an increasing number of Member States in the EU and countries outside Europe constituting a serious risk for public health. Humans are mainly infected through mosquito bites, although infection through blood transfusion and organ transplantation has been documented, as well as trans-placental transmission.\n(4) The Annexes to Decisions No 2119/98/EC and No\u00a02000/96/EC should therefore be amended in order to cover Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza in humans and West Nile virus infection.\n(5) The new International Health Regulations (2005) entered into force on 16 June 2007 and are no longer restricted to specific diseases but cover all public health emergencies of international concern identified as such according to the instrument provided in Annex 2 of the Regulations. It is therefore appropriate to amend the Annex of Decision 2119/98/EC.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 7 of Decision No 2119/98/EC,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision No 2119/98/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "Annex I to Decision 2000/96/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1.
