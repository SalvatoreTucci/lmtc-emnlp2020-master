whereas that Agreement also provides for a mandatory 5 %  increase in the share of the quota reserved for imports from Canada in the event of that share  being exhausted before the end of a given year;\nWhereas, under the Agreement with the United States on the Mediterranean preferences, citrus and  pasta, the community has undertaken to suspend provisionally, within the limits of Community tariff  quotas of appropriate volumes and varying duration, part of the customs duties applicable to  certain fruits and fruit juices;\nWhereas eligibility for these tariff quotas is, however, subject to presentation to the Community  customs authorities of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authorities of the  country of origin certifying that the products comply with the specifications laid down;\nWhereas by its Decision of 9 March 1993 the Commission approved the agreements negotiated between  the Community and the United States of America on the permanent importation, free of custom duties  and agricultural levies, of certain mixtures of malt sprouts and barley screenings, within the  limit of Community tariff quotas;\nWhereas, in the context of the Uruguay Round, it has been agreed to maintain the possibility for  exports to the Community market of chemically pure fructose originating in countries not bound by a  preference agreement with the Community;\nWhereas the Community has, in the context of its external relations, undertaken to open each year,  from 1 July to 31 December and 1 September to 31 August of the following year respectively, a  Community tariff quota for 5 000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets presented in the form of industrial  blocks with bones ('standard`) at a duty of 10 %, and, after various adjustments, another, at zero  duty, for ECU 1 870 000 of value added for various forms of processing work carried out on textiles  under the outward processing arrangements;\nWhereas the Community has declared its readiness to open each year, for certain handmade products,  a zero-duty Community tariff quota for an overall annual amount of ECU 10 540 000, with a maximum  value of ECU 1 200 000 for each group of products covered; whereas eligibility for these Community  tariff quotas is nevertheless subject to presentation to the Community customs authorities of a  certificate issued by the recognized authorities of the country of manufacture certifying that the  goods in question are handmade;\nWhereas the Community has declared itself ready to open zero-rated annual Community tariff quotas  for certain fabrics of silk, silk waste or cotton, woven on handlooms, up to an annual value  (customs value) of ECU 2 316 000 for silk fabrics and ECU 2 069 000 for cotton fabrics; whereas  eligibility for these Community tariff quotas is nevertheless subject to the presentation of a  certificate of manufacture recognized by the relevant Community authorities, the presence of a  stamp approved by those authorities at the beginning and end of each piece, and direct transport  from the country of manufacture to the Community;\nWhereas it is for the Community, in the performance of its international obligations, to open  Community quotas for the products listed in Annexes I to IV to this Regulation; whereas all  Community importers should be guaranteed equal and continuous access to the said quotas, and the  rates of duty laid down for the quotas should be applied without interruption to all imports of the  products concerned into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas there is,  however, no reason why the efficiency of the common administration of these quotas should not be  ensured by authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the requisite quantities  corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method does, however, require close cooperation  between the Member States and the Commission, which must, in particular, be able to monitor the  rate at which quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas Council or Commission Decisions amending the combined nomenclature and Taric codes or  adjusting the volume and rate of quotas result in no substantive changes; whereas, in the interests  of simplification, provision should be made to empower the Commission, after consulting the Customs  Code Committee, to make amendments and technical adjustments to the Annexes to this Regulation;\nWhereas this Regulation must be applicable in the case of amendment of existing agreements within  the framework of the GATT in so far as the amendments adopted specify the products eligible for  tariff quotas, the volume, rate of duty and duration of quotas, and, where relevant, the respective  terms of access; whereas provision should therefore be made to empower the Commission, after  consulting the Customs Code Committee, to make the relevant amendments to the provisions of this  Regulation, including the Annexes thereto;\nWhereas quota volumes may not be carried over from one year to the next;\nWhereas, however, the opening by means of a Regulation of tariff quotas for the agricultural  products referred to in Annexes I and II to this Regulation must be restricted to 1995 in order to  take into account the powers delegated to the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94  (1);\nWhereas the tariff quotas laid down in these agreements are for an unspecified period; whereas,  moreover, they lay down the conditions for access to tariff benefits under the tariff quotas in  question; whereas certain quotas entail specific conditions, which should be laid down in the  Annexes to this Regulation; whereas, therefore, in the interests of rationalizing the  implementation of these measures, the provisions governing the tariff quotas for the products in  question, which are set out in the different Regulations in force at present, should be gathered  together in a single Regulation applicable to certain products, for an unspecified duration;\nWhereas the Council has adopted Regulation (EC) No 3280/94 opening and providing for the  administration of Community tariff quotas bound in GATT for certain agricultural, industrial and  fisheries products (2); whereas this Regulation completes and replaces the said Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.

The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission,  which may take all appropriate measures to ensure their effective administration.\n2.  Where an importer enters a product covered by this Regulation for release for free circulation  in a Member State, applying to take advantage of the tariff quota, and the entry is accepted by the  customs authorities, the Member State concerned shall, by notifying the Commission, draw an amount  corresponding to its needs from the volume of that quota.\nRequests for drawings, showing the date on which such entries were accepted, shall be sent to the  Commission without delay.\nIn so far as the available balance permits, drawings shall be granted by the Commission on the  basis of the date of acceptance of entries for release for free circulation by the customs  authorities of the Member State concerned.\n3.
