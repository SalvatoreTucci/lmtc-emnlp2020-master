The Commission will continue to closely monitor banana imports from Peru,", "main_body": ["The temporary suspension of preferential customs duty on imports of fresh bananas of heading 0803\u00a090\u00a010 of the European Union Combined Nomenclature originating in Peru is not appropriate for the year 2013.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 17, 19.1.2013, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13)."}
