This provision shortens the time limit previously foreseen by the Commission Decisions granting support from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, in conjunction with Article 21(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94(5).\n(2) This shorter deadline by which the Commission must have received applications for payments could result in a significant underspending of the EAGGF Guidance Section; for this reason it is advisable to extend the date in question in order to permit the full consumption of available credits under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,", "main_body": ["1.
