That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC R646 as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 15 June 2012\u00a0(2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, selenomethionine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC R646 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use may be considered as an effective source of selenium for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of selenomethionine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC R646 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The Authority reiterated in its opinion mentioned above the recommendation from its opinion of 15 March 2011\u00a0(3) to limit the maximum supplementation with selenised yeast, an organic selenium compound, to 0,2\u00a0mg Se/kg complete feed for reasons of consumer safety. Selenised yeasts are already authorised by Commission Regulations (EC) No 1750/2006\u00a0(4), (EC) No 634/2007\u00a0(5) and (EC) No 900/2009\u00a0(6). Consequently, these authorisations should be amended in consistency with the Annex to this Regulation. In case inorganic compounds of selenium are also added to the feed, the supplementation with organic Selenium should not exceed 0,2\u00a0mg per kg complete feed.\n(7) Since further use of selenised yeasts as a feed additive at incorporation rates higher than 0,20\u00a0mg Se/kg complete feed may cause a risk to human health, feed materials and compound feed with higher levels of selenised yeasts should be phased out. For practical reasons however, a limited transitional period should be allowed for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018compounds of trace elements\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In column 9 in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1750/2006, the text in the line \u20183b8.10\u2019 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20181.
