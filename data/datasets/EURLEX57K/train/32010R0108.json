Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006\u00a0(2) complemented that framework by introducing detailed implementing rules.\n(2) Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 specifies that for payments linked to Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy\u00a0(3), detailed rules, including the maximum amount of support, are to be fixed.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 11(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC, Member States are obliged to establish a programme of measures for each river basin district by 22 December 2009. In accordance with Article 11(2) of that Directive, these measures have to comprise basic measures, including those already required to implement Union legislation for the protection of water, as referred to in Article 11(3) of that Directive and, where necessary, supplementary measures, as referred to in Article 11(4), which may consist in any of the types of measures listed in Part B of Annex VI to that Directive or in other types of measure not listed in that Annex. While voluntary measures and certain mandatory measures may already be supported under Articles 31 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, detailed rules for the implementation of Article 38(2) of that Regulation need to be defined to cover other mandatory measures.\n(4) In view to avoid overlapping between the meeting standards support as referred to in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, on the one hand, which aims at compensating beneficiaries\u2019 temporary disadvantages due to the obligation to adapt to Union standards in certain fields, and the payment under Article 38 of that Regulation linked to Directive 2000/60/EC on the other hand, which aims at compensating beneficiaries permanent disadvantages due to the obligation to comply with the specific requirements for achieving the environmental objectives of that Directive, provision making distinction on the basis of the types of operations concerned should be made.\n(5) Directive 2000/60/EC provides common principles and the framework for Union action in the field of water policy. The whole Union legislation on water is coordinated in the framework of that Directive which repealed and replaced several water Directives, and whose \u2018programmes of measures\u2019 contain measures which are provided for by previous Directives on water still in force as well as additional measures needed to achieve the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC itself. In the light of that, since part of the requirements formally related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC result in substance from other Union legislation for the protection of water, and have or should already have been implemented by the Member States, the costs and income foregone possibly occurring at present as a consequence of the application of those requirements should not be considered as eligible for compensation. In addition, Article 4(9) of Directive 2000/60/EC provides that the application of the new provisions of that Directive should guarantee at least the same level of protection as the existing Community legislation. Therefore, it seems proportional and appropriate to exclude compensation of costs and income foregone with reference to the requirements related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC resulting from other Union legislation for the protection of water, as well as to only grant support for requirements that go beyond the level of protection of the Union legislation existing at the time that Directive was adopted.\n(6) In addition, part of the legislation related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC is already included in cross compliance. Beneficiaries of the payments under Article 38 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 are already obliged to respect the statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental condition provided for respectively in Articles 5 and 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a073/2009\u00a0(4) which has established common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy as well as certain support schemes for farmers, and in Annexes II and III to that Regulation. Therefore, no compensation should be granted with reference to requirements related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC which are also cross compliance requirements.\n(7) As a consequence of the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC different levels of constraints for farmers may be introduced. Permanent compensation should be allowed only in case of serious disadvantages.\n(8) The maximum amount of support should be fixed. In addition, a minimum amount of permanent support should be set to reflect that compensation should be granted only in cases of serious disadvantage, and provision should be made for going beyond the maximum amount taking account of specific circumstances to be justified in the rural development programmes.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Rural Development Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
