The financing requires a revision of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013 in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, so as to raise the ceilings for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by EUR 650\u00a0million for the year 2012 and by EUR 190\u00a0million for the year 2013 in current prices.\n(2) The increase of the ceilings for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a for the years 2012 and 2013 will be fully offset by a decrease of the ceilings for commitment appropriations for the year 2011 under heading 2 and of commitment appropriations for the years 2011 and 2012 under heading 5.\n(3) In order to keep an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments, the annual ceilings for payment appropriations will be adjusted. The adjustment will be neutral in terms of payment requirements over the period 2007-2013.\n(4) Annex I to the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should therefore be amended accordingly\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Annex I to the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management is replaced by the Annex to this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 13 December 2011.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
