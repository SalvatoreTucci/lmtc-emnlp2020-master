Where such bodies send or receive information for the exchange of human organs, they should act in accordance with the common procedures laid down in this Directive. These procedures should not preclude additional verbal contacts, in particular in case of urgencies.\n(3) In the implementation of this Directive, Member States are to ensure that the processing of donors\u2019 and recipients\u2019 personal data complies with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2). In order to enhance awareness of the persons processing information transmitted pursuant to this Directive, it is appropriate to include a reminder in the written communications pursuant to this Directive.\n(4) In order to allow for rapid responses in case of alerts, and in order to facilitate the implementation of the obligation, provided for in Article 10(3)(b) of Directive 2010/53/EU, to keep data needed to ensure full traceability for a minimum of 30 years after donation, and without prejudice to the obligations of other bodies in that respect, it is appropriate that competent authorities or delegated bodies handle and record that information. Procurement organisations and transplantation centres should therefore ensure that their respective competent authorities or delegated bodies receive a copy of the information on organ and donor characterisation exchanged pursuant to this Directive, where applicable.\n(5) Given the current variety of practices between Member States, it is not appropriate at this stage to provide for a standard form for the transmission of information on organ and donor characterisation in this Directive. However, in order to facilitate mutual understanding of the information transmitted, such a standard form should be developed in the future, in cooperation with the Member States.\n(6) A serious adverse event or reaction may be detected in a Member State of origin or destination and may be of concern for the quality and safety of the donated organs and as a consequence for the health of recipients, and in case of living donation also for the health of the donor. When organs are exchanged between Member States, such concerns may occur in different Member States. Moreover, organs from one donor might be transplanted into recipients in different Member States so that, if a serious adverse event or reaction is first detected in one Member State of destination, the competent authorities or delegated bodies in the Member State of origin and in the other Member States of destination have to be informed. It is essential to ensure that all competent authorities or delegated bodies of all the Member States concerned are informed without undue delay. In order to reach this objective, Member States should ensure that all relevant information is disseminated among all Member States concerned through a set of written reports. Initial reports should be updated if additional relevant information becomes available.\n(7) The transmission of information is very often a matter of urgency. It is essential that the senders of information are able to identify and inform rapidly the relevant addressees. The competent authorities or delegated bodies of a Member State should, where appropriate in accordance with the repartition of competence in the Member State concerned, transfer the information received pursuant to this Directive to the appropriate recipient. A list of national contact points, including their contact details, should be made available at Union level and be constantly kept up to date.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on organ transplantation, established under Article 30 of Directive 2010/53/EU,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Directive shall apply to the cross-border exchange of human organs intended for transplantation within the European Union.", "Subject matter\nIn line with Article 29 of Directive 2010/53/EU, this Directive sets out:\n(a) procedures for the transmission of information on organ and donor characterisation;\n(b) procedures for the transmission of the necessary information to ensure the traceability of organs;\n(c) procedures for ensuring the reporting of serious adverse events and reactions.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Member State of origin\u2019 means the Member State where the organ is procured with the purpose of transplantation;\n(b) \u2018Member State of destination\u2019 means the Member State to which the organ is sent for the purpose of transplantation;\n(c) \u2018National donor/recipient identification number\u2019 means the identification code attributed to a donor or a recipient in accordance with the identification system established at national level pursuant to Article 10(2) of Directive 2010/53/EU;\n(d) \u2018Specification of the organ\u2019 means (1) the anatomical description of an organ including: its type (e.g. heart, liver); (2) where applicable, its position (left or right) in the body; and (3) whether it is a whole organ or a part of an organ, mentioning the lobe or segment of the organ;\n(e) \u2018a delegated body\u2019 means a body to which tasks have been delegated in accordance with Article 17(1) of Directive 2010/53/EU or a European organ exchange organisation to which tasks have been delegated in accordance with Article 21 of Directive 2010/53/EU.", "Common procedural rules\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the information transmitted pursuant to this Directive between competent authorities or delegated bodies, procurement organisations and/or transplantation centres:\n(a) is transmitted in writing either electronically or by fax;\n(b) is written in a language mutually understood by the sender and the addressee or, in absence thereof, in a mutually agreed language, or, in absence thereof, in English;\n(c) is transmitted without undue delay;\n(d) is recorded and can be made available upon request;\n(e) indicates the date and time of the transmission;\n(f) includes the contact details of the person responsible for the transmission;\n(g) contains the following reminder:\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In case of urgencies, the information can be exchanged in a verbal form, in particular for exchanges pursuant to Articles 5 and 7.
