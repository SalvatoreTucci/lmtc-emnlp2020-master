The depreciation percentage at the time of the buying-in of the agricultural products must not exceed the difference between the buying-in price and the foreseeable disposal price for each of these products. That percentage must be fixed for each product before the beginning of each accounting year. The Commission may also restrict the depreciation at the time of buying-in to a fraction of this depreciation percentage, but that fraction may not be less than 70\u00a0% of the overall depreciation.\n(3) Coefficients for certain products to be applied by the intervention agencies to the monthly buying-in values of those products in the 2010 accounting year should therefore be fixed, to enable the agencies to establish the depreciation amounts.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["In respect of the products listed in the Annex hereto which, having been bought in by public intervention, are stored or taken over by the intervention agencies between 1 October 2009 and 30 September 2010, the intervention agencies shall apply to the values of the products bought in every month the depreciation coefficients set out in the Annex.", "The expenditure amounts, calculated by taking account of the depreciation referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation, shall be notified to the Commission under the declarations established in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006\u00a0(3).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0209, 11.8.2005, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0171, 23.6.2006, p.\u00a035.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0171, 23.6.2006, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nDEPRECIATION COEFFICIENTS TO BE APPLIED TO THE MONTHLY BUYING-IN VALUES\nProducts Coefficient\nCommon wheat of bread-making quality 0,02\nBarley 0,02\nSorghum 0,02\nSkimmed-milk powder 0,10"}
