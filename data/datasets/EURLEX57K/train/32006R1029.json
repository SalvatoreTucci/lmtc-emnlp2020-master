For reasons of clarity it is appropriate to adapt those references. Likewise, the definition of the term \u2018carcass\u2019 should be adapted to Annex III Section II Chapter IV(7)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.\n(4) The second indent of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 excludes from the scope of that Regulation the type of sales referred to in Chapter II Article 3(II) of Directive 71/118/EEC. This latter provision deals with an optional derogation for Member States concerning small-scale production of under 10\u00a0000 birds. Whilst Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 and (EC) No 853/2004 contain a derogation, which is neither optional nor limited to a specific number of birds, an optional derogation such as that in Article 3(II) of Directive 71/118/EEC, limited to a specific number of birds, should be retained for Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90.\n(5) Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 contains a reference to Commission Directive 80/879/EEC of 3 September 1980 on the health marking of large packagings of poultrymeat\u00a0(9). That Directive has been repealed by Council Directive 92/116/EEC of 17 December 1992 amending and updating Directive 71/118/EEC on health problems affecting trade in fresh poultrymeat\u00a0(10). That reference is redundant and should be deleted.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
