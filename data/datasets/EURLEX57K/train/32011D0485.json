However, there are strong indications that integration of the applications of that technology in car manufacturing will not be achieved by the deadline set for short-range technology in the 24\u00a0GHz range and that, considering the time still necessary for the development, integration and testing phases, it is likely that integration of 79\u00a0GHz radars in cars to allow for a mass market distribution will be feasible by 2018 or a few years before at the earliest.\n(4) Moreover, an additional period will be necessary in order to ensure the transition from the 24\u00a0GHz technology to the 79\u00a0GHz technology on car lines using 24\u00a0GHz technology which will exist when the new car lines equipped with the 79\u00a0GHz technology appear.\n(5) It is essential to ensure continuity of the existing and future production of cars equipped with 24\u00a0GHz radars, considering their importance for traffic safety and the need to encourage the development of such applications in as many of the existing vehicles as possible; therefore a discontinuity of usable spectrum for radars must be avoided and a temporary solution is needed in order to ensure the transition between 1 July 2013 and 1 January 2018. To allow for an additional transition period, the date of 1 January 2018 should be extended by 4 years for automotive short-range radar equipment mounted on motor vehicles for which a type-approval application has been granted before 1 January 2018.\n(6) Considering the international protection granted to radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research passive services in the 23,60\u00a0GHz to 24\u00a0GHz band, and the exceptional character of the designation of that band for short-range radars by Decision 2005/50/EC, a prolongation of such designation is not a viable option. Moreover, the band 24\u00a0GHz to 24,25\u00a0GHz has been designated for industrial, scientific and medical purposes (ISM band).\n(7) CEPT compatibility studies, including some military systems, indicate that the 24,25\u00a0GHz to 27,50\u00a0GHz band may be a technically feasible alternative solution. The band above 26,50\u00a0GHz has been identified by NATO as a planned military band for fixed and mobile systems.\n(8) The threshold of a 7\u00a0% penetration rate imposed by Decision 2005/50/EC should be maintained, as there is no indication that such a limit would be exceeded before the switch-over to the 79\u00a0GHz band and to underline that the 24\u00a0GHz band remains a transitional solution.\n(9) The Commission, assisted by the Member States, should continue to monitor the application of this Decision, in particular regarding the threshold limit, and the absence of harmful interference to other users of the band or to neighbouring bands, whether or not the threshold of 7\u00a0% is exceeded.\n(10) Decision 2005/50/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/50/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 2, point 5 is replaced by the following:\n\u20185. \u201creference dates\u201d means 30 June 2013 for the frequency between 21,65 and 24,25\u00a0GHz and 1 January 2018 for the frequency between 24,25 and 26,65\u00a0GHz;\u2019;\n2.
