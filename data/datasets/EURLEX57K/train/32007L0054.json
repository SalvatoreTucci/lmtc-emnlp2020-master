It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.\n(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.\n(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.\n(4) Substances for which no updated safety files are submitted allowing an adequate risk assessment should be included in Annex II.\n(5) However 4,4\u2032-Diaminodiphenylamine and its salts; 4-Diethylamino-o-toluidine and its salts; N,N-Diethyl-p-phenylenediamine and its salts; N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and its salts; and Toluene-3,4-Diamine and its salts, are currently listed under reference numbers 8 and 9 in Annex III, Part 1, which are general entries. Therefore they should be expressly deleted from general entries in Annex III. It is appropriate to list them in Annex II instead. Those annexes should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 18 March 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
