Therefore, rotenone should be added to the lists of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012.\n(7) The approval of the substance didecyldimethylammonium chloride has been withdrawn in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, with the effect that didecyldimethylammonium chloride is banned for use as pesticide in the group of plant protection products and thus should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012.\n(8) The substances warfarin and cyfluthrin are no longer approved as active substances in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, with the effect that those substances are banned for use as pesticide in the group of plant protection products and thus should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012.\n(9) At its sixth meeting held from 28 April to 10 May 2013, the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention decided to include azinphos-methyl, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonamides and perfluorooctane sulfonyls in Annex III to that Convention, with the effect that those chemicals became subject to the PIC procedure under that Convention. Those chemicals should thus be removed from the list of chemicals contained in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 and added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 3 of that Annex.\n(10) The Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention also decided to include commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether, including tetra- and pentabromodiphenyl ether, as well as commercial octabromodiphenyl ether, including hexa- and heptabromodiphenyl ether, in Annex III to that Convention, with the effect that those chemicals became subject to the PIC procedure under that Convention. Since tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether are already listed in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 and are therefore subject to an export ban, those chemicals are not added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012.\n(11) The entry for chlorate in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 should be amended in order to provide more clarity as to the substances covered by that entry.\n(12) Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) In order to allow enough time for all interested parties to take the measures necessary to comply with this Regulation and for Member States to take the measures necessary for its implementation, its application should be deferred,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 December 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0201, 27.7.2012, p.\u00a060.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Decision 2003/106/EC of 19 December 2002 concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (OJ L\u00a063, 6.3.2003, p.\u00a027).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L\u00a0396, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (OJ L\u00a0309, 24.11.2009, p.\u00a01).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (OJ L\u00a0167, 27.6.2012, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 is amended as follows:\n1.
