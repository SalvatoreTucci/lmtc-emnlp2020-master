Following the enlargement of the Community on 1 May 2004, Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 also provides for transitional measures in respect of those criteria for the year 2005.\n(3) The demand for export licences for some quotas and product groups has shown a significant increase and exceeds, sometimes by far, the quantities available. This may lead to a substantial reduction in the quantities allocated per applicant, thereby reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme. In addition, where the quantities allocated to each operator are very small, experience has shown that there is a risk of an operator being unable in such circumstances to fulfil his obligation to export with the consequent loss of the security.\n(4) In order to deal with that situation, it is appropriate to apply a combination of the three criteria referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, taking into account the transitional measures provided for. In accordance with points (a) and (b) of that subparagraph, licences should be allocated in preference to applicants who have already been engaged in the United States of America, whose designated importers are subsidiaries and who have exported a quantity of the products concerned to that destination in the past. In addition, a reduction coefficient should be applied pursuant to point (c) of that subparagraph.\n(5) In the case of product groups and quotas for which the applications lodged are for quantities less than those available, it is appropriate, in accordance with Article 20(5) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, to provide for the allocation of the remaining quantities to the applicants in proportion to the quantities applied for. The allocation of such further quantities should be conditional upon the interested operator making a request and lodging a security.\n(6) Given the time limit for the implementation of this procedure, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1847/2004, this Regulation should apply as soon as possible.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for provisional export licences lodged pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1847/2004 in respect of the product groups and quotas identified by 16-Tokyo, 16-, 17-, 18-, 20- and 21-Uruguay, 25-Tokyo and 25-Uruguay in column 3 of the Annex to this Regulation shall be accepted, subject to the application of the allocation coefficients laid down in column 5 of that Annex, when they are submitted by:\n\u2014 applicants who show an export to the United States of America of the products in question during at least one of the preceding three years and whose designated importers are subsidiaries, or\n\u2014 applicants whose designated importers are deemed to be subsidiaries pursuant to point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999.\nApplications referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accepted, subject to the application of the allocation coefficients laid down in column 6 of the Annex, when they are submitted by:\n\u2014 applicants other than those referred to in the first subparagraph who show an export to the United States of America of the products in question during each of the preceding three years, or\n\u2014 applicants in respect of whom an historical performance is not required pursuant to point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999.\nApplications referred to in the first subparagraph shall be rejected when they are submitted by applicants other than those referred to in the first and second subparagraphs.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the allocated quantity resulting from the application of paragraph 1 is less than 2 tonnes, applicants may withdrawn their application.
