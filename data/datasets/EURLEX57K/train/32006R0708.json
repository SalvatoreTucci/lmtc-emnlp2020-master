IFRIC 7 clarifies the requirements under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies relating to issues that companies had regarding how a company should restate its financial statements pursuant to IAS 29 in the first year it identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency.\n(3) On 15 December 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued Amendment to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates \u2014 Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, to clarify its requirements regarding an entity's investment in foreign operations. Companies had raised concerns relating to loans that form part of a company's investment in a foreign operation as IAS 21 included provisions requiring the loan to be denominated in the functional currency of either the company or the foreign operation in order that the exchange differences arising could be recognised in the equity section of the consolidated financial statements. However, in practice the loan may be denominated in another (third) currency. The IASB concluded that it had not intended to impose this restriction, therefore published this amendment to permit the loan to be denominated in a third currency.\n(4) The consultation with technical experts in the field confirm that IFRIC 7 and the Amendment to IAS 21 meet the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1725/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Accounting Regulatory Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1725/2003 is amended as follows:\n1.

Therefore, in relation to non-monetary items measured at historical cost, the entity\u2019s opening balance sheet at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements shall be restated to reflect the effect of inflation from the date the assets were acquired and the liabilities were incurred or assumed until the closing balance sheet date of the reporting period. For non-monetary items carried in the opening balance sheet at amounts current at dates other than those of acquisition or incurrence, that restatement shall reflect instead the effect of inflation from the dates those carrying amounts were determined until the closing balance sheet date of the reporting period.\n4 At the closing balance sheet date, deferred tax items are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12. However, the deferred tax figures in the opening balance sheet for the reporting period shall be determined as follows:\n(a) the entity remeasures the deferred tax items in accordance with IAS 12 after it has restated the nominal carrying amounts of its non monetary items at the date of the opening balance sheet of the reporting period by applying the measuring unit at that date.\n(b) the deferred tax items remeasured in accordance with (a) are restated for the change in the measuring unit from the date of the opening balance sheet of the reporting period to the closing balance sheet date of that period.\n5 After an entity has restated its financial statements, all corresponding figures in the financial statements for a subsequent reporting period, including deferred tax items, are restated by applying the change in the measuring unit for that subsequent reporting period only to the restated financial statements for the previous reporting period.\nEffective date\n6 An entity shall apply this Interpretation for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006. Earlier application is encouraged. If an entity applies this Interpretation to financial statements for a period beginning before 1 March 2006, it shall disclose that fact.\nAmendment to IAS 21\nThe Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\nThis document sets out amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The amendments finalise proposals that were contained in Draft Technical Correction 1 Proposed Amendments to IAS 21 Net Investment in a Foreign Operation published in September 2005.\nAn entity shall apply the amendments in this document for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006. Earlier application is encouraged.\nNet investment in a foreign operation\nParagraph 15A is added as follows.\n\u201815A The entity that has a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation described in paragraph 15 may be any subsidiary of the group. For example, an entity has two subsidiaries, A and B. Subsidiary B is a foreign operation. Subsidiary A grants a loan to Subsidiary B. Subsidiary A\u2019s loan receivable from Subsidiary B would be part of the entity\u2019s net investment in Subsidiary B if settlement of the loan is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. This would also be true if Subsidiary A were itself a foreign operation.\u2019\nRecognition of exchange difference\nParagraph 33 is amended as follows.\n\u201833 When a monetary item forms part of a reporting entity\u2019s net investment in a foreign operation and is denominated in the functional currency of the reporting entity, an exchange difference arises in the foreign operation\u2019s individual financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. If such an item is denominated in the functional currency of the foreign operation, an exchange difference arises in the reporting entity\u2019s separate financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. If such an item is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of either the reporting entity or the foreign operation, an exchange difference arises in the reporting entity\u2019s separate financial statements and in the foreign operation\u2019s individual financial statements in accordance with paragraph 28. Such exchange differences are reclassified to the separate component of equity in the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting entity (ie financial statements in which the foreign operation is consolidated, proportionately consolidated or accounted for using the equity method).\u2019\nParagraph 58A is added as follows.\n\u201858A Net Investment in a Foreign Operation (Amendment to IAS 21), issued in December 2005, added paragraph 15A and amended paragraph 33. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006. Earlier application is encouraged.\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The identification of hyperinflation is based on the entity\u2019s judgement of the criteria in paragraph 3 of IAS 29."}
