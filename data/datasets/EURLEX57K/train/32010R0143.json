The three conventions mentioned are listed as core human rights conventions respectively in points 1, 5 and 6 of Annex III, Part A, to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008.\n(4) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 provides for the temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance granted pursuant to that Regulation, in particular if the national legislation incorporating the conventions referred to in Annex III to that Regulation, which have been ratified in fulfilment of the requirements of Article 8(1) and (2) of that Regulation, is not effectively implemented.\n(5) By Commission Decision 2008/803/EC\u00a0(4), an investigation was initiated in order to establish \u2018whether the national legislation of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka incorporating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child is effectively implemented\u2019.\n(6) Throughout the course of the investigation the Commission provided Sri Lanka with every opportunity to cooperate in the investigation, including by providing Sri Lanka with the opportunity to comment on the comprehensive findings of experts entrusted by the Commission to provide an independent legal assessment of the matters under the investigation. Despite the fact that Sri Lanka decided not to cooperate with, or participate in, the investigation, the Commission maintained regular contact with Sri Lanka outside the framework of the investigation so as to enable Sri Lanka to bring to the Commission\u2019s attention any information relevant to the investigation. The information received in this context from Sri Lanka has been taken by the Commission fully into account and has contributed to inform its assessment.\n(7) On 19 October 2009, the Commission approved a report containing its findings (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Report\u2019). The Report concludes that the national legislation of Sri Lanka incorporating international human rights conventions, specifically the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is not effectively implemented.\n(8) Sri Lanka was provided with the Report containing the findings of the investigation and reminded that those findings constituted the basis on which the Commission intended to decide whether to recommend the temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. Sri Lanka was also granted a period within which it could make representations on this matter or specifically in relation to the Report.\n(9) Sri Lanka provided the Commission with a number of observations in respect of the subject-matter of the Report and conduct of the investigation. These observations covered also facts and findings on which Sri Lanka was given the opportunity to comment during the investigation but did not do so. The Commission nevertheless considered Sri Lanka\u2019s observations carefully and in particular those relevant in the context of a decision on temporary withdrawal. The Commission\u2019s assessment, of which Sri Lanka was informed, led to the conclusion that none of Sri Lanka\u2019s arguments would substantively alter the findings of the investigation.\n(10) The Commission has submitted the Report on the findings of the investigation to the Generalised Preferences Committee on 17 November 2009, in accordance with Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008.\n(11) In the light of the foregoing, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be withdrawn temporarily for all products originating in Sri Lanka, until it is decided that the reasons justifying the temporary withdrawal no longer prevail.\n(12) This Regulation should enter into force 6 months after its adoption, unless the Council decides before then, upon a proposal from the Commission, that the reasons justifying it no longer prevail,", "main_body": ["The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance for products originating in Sri Lanka provided for in Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 shall be withdrawn temporarily.", "With respect to the period of application of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission, shall re-establish the special incentive arrangement for products originating in Sri Lanka, if the reasons justifying the temporary withdrawal no longer prevail.", "This Regulation shall enter into force 6 months after its adoption, unless the Council before then, on a proposal from the Commission pursuant to Article 19(5) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, decides otherwise.", "This Regulation shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 February 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\n\u00c1.
