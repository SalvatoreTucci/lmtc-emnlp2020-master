The Union list set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lists food additives on the basis of the categories of food to which those additives may be added.\n(4) Due to the difficulties encountered during the transfer of food additives to the new categorisation system provided in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, certain errors have been introduced and should be corrected. In particular, the use of antioxidants in peeled, cut and shredded fruit and vegetables should be restricted to prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption only. The use of Sorbic acid \u2014 sorbates, Benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates; p-hydroxybenzoates (E 200-219) should continue to be authorised in heat-treated meat products and the use of Natamycin (E 235) should continue to be authorised in heat-treated dried cured sausages. Maximum limits for the use of Curcumine (E 100) in processed fish and fishery products including molluscs and crustaceans should be introduced corresponding to the levels specified in Directive 94/36/EC. The maximum limits for the use of Silicon dioxide \u2014 silicates (E 551-559) should be changed to quantum satis as specified in Directive 95/2/EC and for the use of Silicon dioxide \u2014 silicates (E 551-553) as specified by Commission Regulation (EU) No 380/2012 of 3 May 2012 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the conditions of use and the use levels for aluminium-containing food additives\u00a0(6).\n(5) There are clarifications necessary as regards the use of food additives in certain food categories. In food category 13.1.4 \u2018Other food for young children\u2019 conditions of use for the food additives E 332 \u2018Potassium citrates\u2019 and E 338 \u2018Phosphoric acid\u2019 should be set. In food category 14.2.6 \u2018Spirit drinks as defined in Regulation (EC) No 110/2008\u2019 the use of food colours should not be authorised in Geist as defined in Annex II.17 of Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89\u00a0(7). The use of the food colours Quinoline Yellow (E 104), Sunset Yellow FCF/Orange Yellow S (E 110) and Ponceau 4R, Cochineal Red A (E 124) in certain spirit drinks should be reintroduced as this use is not of safety concern for children. It should be clarified that Caramels (E 150a-d) can be used in all products belonging to food category 14.2.7.1 \u2018Aromatised wines\u2019.\n(6) Therefore, the Union list of food additives should be corrected, clarified and completed in order to include all the uses permitted and complying with Articles 6, 7 and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the Union list is amended in order to include uses already permitted in accordance with Directive 94/35/EC, Directive 94/36/EC, and Directive 95/2/EC, it constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health. Therefore, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.\n(8) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0237, 10.9.1994, p.\u00a03.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0237, 10.9.1994, p.\u00a013.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a061, 18.3.1995, p.\u00a01.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0119, 4.5.2012, p.\u00a014.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a039, 13.2.2008, p.\u00a016.\nANNEX\nPart E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In food category 01.7.1 \u2018Unripened cheese excluding products falling in category 16\u2019, the entry concerning \u2018Group I\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Group I Additives   except mozzarella\u2019\n(2) In food category 04.1.2 \u2018Peeled, cut and shredded fruit and vegetables\u2019, the entries concerning food additives E 300 \u2018Ascorbic acid\u2019, E 301 \u2018Sodium ascorbate\u2019, E 302 \u2018Calcium ascorbate\u2019, E 330 \u2018Citric acid\u2019, E 331 \u2018Sodium citrates\u2019, E 332 \u2018Potassium citrates\u2019 and E 333 \u2018Calcium citrates\u2019 are replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 300 Ascorbic acid quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 301 Sodium ascorbate quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 302 Calcium ascorbate quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 330 Citric acid quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 331 Sodium citrates quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 332 Potassium citrates quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\nE 333 Calcium citrates quantum satis  only prepacked refrigerated unprocessed fruit and vegetables ready for consumption and prepacked unprocessed and peeled potatoes\u2019\n(3) Food category 08.2.2 \u2018Heat-treated processed meat\u2019 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following entry concerning food additive E 200-219 is inserted after the entry concerning food additive E 200-203 \u2018Sorbic acid \u2014 sorbates\u2019:\n\u2018E 200-219 Sorbic acid \u2014 sorbates, Benzoic acid \u2014 benzoates;
