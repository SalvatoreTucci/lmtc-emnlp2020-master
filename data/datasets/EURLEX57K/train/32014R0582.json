An adjustment period, with effect from the date on which the application was lodged with the Commission, was therefore granted to those undertakings under Article 5(6) of Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006\u00a0(3), which was in force when the application was submitted.\n(4) Moreover, as the undertakings met the requirements laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the French authorities asked the Commission in the same letter to set a transitional period under that article to allow the undertakings to make legal use of the sales name after registration.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 has now been replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, in force since 3 January 2013.
