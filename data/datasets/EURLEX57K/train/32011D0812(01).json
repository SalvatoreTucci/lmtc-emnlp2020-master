This Group should be composed of the Member States, in particular of their Competent Authorities, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and representative bodies of the industry concerned and relevant customers.\n(2) Security of gas supply is a shared responsibility of natural gas undertakings, Member States, and the Commission within their respective areas of activities and competence. Moreover, customers using gas for electricity generation or industrial purposes may also have an important role to play in security of gas supply through their ability to respond to a crisis with demand-side measures. Therefore, in order to ensure the best coordination of measures to be taken under Regulation (EU) No 994/2010, the representative bodies of the industry concerned and those of relevant customers should participate actively in the work of the Gas Coordination Group.\n(3) The Commission should, in consultation with the Member States, decide on the composition of the Group, ensuring it is fully representative and that a three-level approach is respected which involves first the relevant natural gas undertakings and industry, then Member States at national or regional level, and then the Union.\n(4) The following bodies of the industry concerned should be considered to be representative:\n\u2014 the representative European association of the storage system operators in the sense of Article 2(10) of Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC\u00a0(2) and of LNG system operators in the sense of Article 2(12) of Directive 2009/73/EC,\n\u2014 the European association of the gas supplying industry,\n\u2014 the international association representing gas producers in Europe,\n\u2014 the European association of gas traders.\n(5) As for the relevant consumers, four main sectors consuming natural gas should be distinguished:\n\u2014 the industrial sector,\n\u2014 the power sector using gas as a fuel,\n\u2014 the household sector,\n\u2014 the district heating sector.\n(6) The Gas Coordination Group should act as adviser to the Commission to facilitate the coordination of security of supply measures in the event of a Union or regional emergency. It is also the main body to be consulted by the Commission in the context of the establishment of the Preventive Action Plans and the Emergency Plans. The Gas Coordination Group should monitor the adequacy and appropriateness of measures to be taken under the Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 and exchange all information relevant for security of gas supply at national, regional and Union levels.\n(7) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be laid down.\n(8) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n(9) Decision 2006/791/EC should be repealed,", "main_body": ["Composition of the Gas Coordination Group (\u2018the Group\u2019)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Group shall be composed of the following members:\n(a) the Member States, in particular their Competent Authorities in the sense of Article 2(2) of the Regulation (EU) No 994/2010;\n(b) the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (\u2018the Agency\u2019);\n(c) the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (\u2018the ENTSO for Gas\u2019);\n(d) the Energy Community Secretariat;\n(e) Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) as the representative body of Storage System Operators and LNG System Operators;\n(f) Eurogas;\n(g) the International Association of the Oil and Gas Producers (OGP);\n(h) European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET);\n(i) the International Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers (IFIEC Europe);\n(j) Eurelectric;\n(k) the European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC);\n(l) Euroheat & Power.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each of the members shall nominate not more than two permanent representatives and two alternates to participate in the work of the Group.
