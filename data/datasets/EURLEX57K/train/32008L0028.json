Adjusting that Directive necessitates adjusting Directives 92/42/EEC, 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC.\n(5) The Commission should be empowered to amend or repeal Directives 92/42/EEC, 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC. Such amendment or repeal must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(6) In addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures laying down ecodesign requirements for defined energy-using products, including the introduction of implementing measures during the transitional period, and including where appropriate provisions on the balancing of the various environmental aspects. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2005/32/EC by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.\n(7) Directive 2005/32/EC and Directives 92/42/EEC, 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) Since the amendments made to Directive 2005/32/EC, as well as to Directives 92/42/EEC, 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC, by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
