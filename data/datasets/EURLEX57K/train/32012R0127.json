Since the replacement of Directive 91/414/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this substance is deemed to have been approved under that Regulation and is listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011, implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances\u00a0(4).\n(2) On 23 March 2010 one of the notifiers at whose request metazachlor was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, submitted an application for an amendment to the specific provisions of use of metazachlor to allow more frequent applications on the same field, without however exceeding the total maximum amount of 1,0\u00a0kg/ha over a three-year period. That application was accompanied by additional information. It was submitted to the United Kingdom which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002\u00a0(5).\n(3) The rapporteur Member State assessed the additional information submitted by the applicant and prepared an addendum to the draft assessment report. It submitted that addendum to the Commission on 4 January 2011 which communicated it to the other Member States and to the European Food Safety Authority for comments. The addendum to the draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 24 January 2012 in the format of an addendum to the Commission review report for metazachlor.\n(4) It has appeared from the various examinations carried out that the amendment to the specific provisions of use applied for does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the approval of metazachlor and in the Commission review report for that substance.\n(5) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nIn the column \u2018Specific provisions\u2019 of row number 217, metazachlor, of Part A of the Annex, Part A is replaced by the following:\n\u2018PART A\nOnly uses as herbicide may be authorised.
