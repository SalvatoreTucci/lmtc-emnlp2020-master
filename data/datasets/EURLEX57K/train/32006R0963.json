Eight years of experience have shown the need to provide for an expiry date of the suspensions listed in the Annex to this Regulation to ensure that account is taken of technological and economic changes. This should not exclude the premature termination of certain measures or their continuation beyond this period, if economic reasons are submitted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Commission Communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas\u00a0(2).\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation shall be inserted;\n2. the products for which the CN codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation shall be deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2006.\nHowever, for products with TARIC codes 5205310010 and 8414308920, it shall apply from 1 January 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 27 June 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
