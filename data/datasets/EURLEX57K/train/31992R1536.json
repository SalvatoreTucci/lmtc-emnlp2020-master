whereas it is completely without prejudice to their classification and tariff treatment when imported into the Community, in particular for the granting of preferential arrangements;\nWhereas, in order to ensure clarity in the trade description of the products concerned, the presentation in which they are marketed should be defined and the method of designation of the covering media laid down;
