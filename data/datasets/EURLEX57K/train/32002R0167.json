Those arrangements provide for subsidised, voluntary distillation in order to support the wine market and help ensure continued supplies to the potable alcohol sector, which traditionally uses this type of alcohol. To that end, wine producers and distillers conclude contracts, which the Member States notify to the Commission twice a month.\n(2) Article 63(6) lays down the conditions under which the Commission must intervene in the contract-approval procedure, setting a single percentage for acceptance of the contracts concluded for distillation and/or suspending the notification of new contracts, where the available budgetary resources or the absorption capacity of the potable alcohol sector are exceeded or may be exceeded.\n(3) For the 2001/02 wine year the Commission has, for budgetary reasons and bearing in mind the absorption capacity of the potable alcohol sector, managed this distillation in quantitatively limited tranches. The second tranche was opened from 1 January 2002 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2512/2001 of 20 December 2001 opening a second tranche of distillation as provided for in Article 29 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for the 2001/02 wine year(5). Contracts can be concluded under this tranche for a maximum of 3 million hl of table wine. On the basis of the quantities of wine for which the Member States notified new distillation contracts to the Commission on 21 January 2002, the Commission notes that that limit has been exceeded. The Commission should therefore set a single percentage for acceptance of the quantities notified for distillation and suspend the notification of new contracts,", "main_body": ["1.
