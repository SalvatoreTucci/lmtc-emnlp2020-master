The provision establishing a ten month validity period should therefore only apply to the budget period 2009 and cover the certificates applied for at the latest on 7 November 2008. That provision is no longer needed and should therefore be deleted.\n(3) Since Commission Regulation (EC) No 585/2009 of 6 July 2009 providing for exceptional measures regarding refund certificates for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\u00a0(3) applies only to the refund certificates applied for between 8 July and 7 November 2008, in compliance with point (a) of Article 33 or Article 38a of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, it is appropriate to specify that the amendments made by the this Regulation are without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 585/2009.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,", "main_body": ["Article 39(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.
