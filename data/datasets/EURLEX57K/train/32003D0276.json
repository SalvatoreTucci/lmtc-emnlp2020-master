The excessive and uncontrolled accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition poses a threat to peace and security and reduces the prospects for sustainable development; this is acutely the case in Albania.\n(2) In pursuing the objectives set out in Article 1 of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP, the European Union envisages operating within the relevant international fora and in a regional context, as appropriate, to render assistance through international organisations, programmes and agencies as well as regional arrangements.\n(3) The Albanian Ministry of Defence has identified a large amount of SALW ammunition, surplus to their requirements or recovered from the public. Much of the ammunition is incorrectly packaged and stored in inappropriate locations and conditions.\n(4) The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), under the terms of the Partnership for Peace Trust Fund, is managing a project aimed at the consolidation and demilitarisation of surplus SALW ammunition, amounting to a total of 11\u00a0665 tonnes, during a period of four years.\n(5) The Commission has agreed to be entrusted with the implementation of this Decision.\n(6) The European Union therefore intends to offer financial assistance to the NAMSA project in accordance with Title II of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP.\n(7) The Commission will ensure an adequate visibility of the contribution of the EU to the project, including by appropriate measures taken by NAMSA,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Union shall contribute to the destruction of surplus SALW ammunition in Albania.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this purpose, the European Union shall provide financial support to the NAMSA project aimed at the consolidation and demilitarisation of surplus SALW ammunition.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be entrusted with the implementation of this Decision.
