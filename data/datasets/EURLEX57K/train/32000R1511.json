Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product, an intervention threshold for apples should be set for the 2000/01 marketing year.\n(3) The intervention threshold for apples should be set on the basis of a percentage of the average quantity of produce, intended for consumption fresh, of the last five marketing years for which data are available. The period to be taken into account for assessing the overrun of the threshold should also be determined.\n(4) Pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27, an overrun of the intervention threshold results in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following the year in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of such an overrun should be determined and a reduction in proportion to the size of the overrun set.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["1. The intervention threshold for apples for the 2000/01 marketing year shall be 486900 tonnes.\n2. Any overrun of the intervention threshold shall be assessed on the basis of withdrawals effected between 1 June 2000 and 31 May 2001.", "If the quantity of apples subject to withdrawals during the period laid down in Article 1(2) exceeds the threshold laid down in Article 1(1), the Community withdrawal compensation set under Article 26 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for the following marketing year shall be reduced in proportion to the size of the overrun based on the production used to calculate the relevant threshold.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 80.\n(3) OJ L 180, 15.7.1999, p. 3."}
