However, notwithstanding paragraph 1, any legal or natural person or group of persons processing grapes harvested in Austria shall be obliged to withdraw under supervision the by-products of such processing. Such by-products shall present the minimum characteristics required by Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88. The competent Austrian authorities shall adopt suitable national measures to ensure the proper application of this measure.\n3. Where the voluntary distillation measures laid down in Articles 38 and 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 are initiated, the Commission shall, in establishing the quantities of wine concerned, the prices and aids in Austria, take account of the impact of compulsory distillation on producers' incomes in that Member State.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 1996.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 August 1996.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 84, 27. 3. 1987, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 206, 16. 8. 1996, p. 31.\n(3) OJ No L 175, 27. 7. 1995, p. 57.\n(4) OJ No L 277, 8. 10. 1988, p. 21.\n(5) OJ No L 241, 10. 10. 1995, p. 17."}
