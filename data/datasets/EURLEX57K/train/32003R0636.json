The impending adjustment of the refunds applicable to those products has led to the submission of applications for export licences for speculative ends. There is a risk that the issue of licences for the quantities applied for from 31 March to 4 April and 7 to 8 April 2003 may lead to an overrun in the quantities of the products concerned normally disposed of by way of trade. Applications covering the products concerned in respect of which export licences have not yet been granted should be rejected,", "main_body": ["No further action shall be taken in respect of applications submitted for export licences for poultrymeat of 31 March to 4 April and 7 and 8 April 2003 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 in respect of category three of Annex I to that Regulation which should have been issued from 9 April and from 16 April 2003 respectively.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 9 April 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 April 2003.\nFor the Commission\nJ.
