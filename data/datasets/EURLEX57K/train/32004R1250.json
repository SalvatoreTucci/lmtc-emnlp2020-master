The level of the premium is to rise each year until 2007 to offset the reduction in market support, which applies annually on 1 July, the start of the milk year.\n(3) The operative event for the exchange rate for the purposes of the dairy premium should therefore be set at 1 July of the year for which the aid is granted. For the sake of consistency, it should also be laid down that the same operative event for the exchange rate is to apply to the dairy premium and to additional payments.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture\u00a0(4) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["In Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 the following third subparagraph is added:\n\u2018For the dairy premium and additional payments referred to in Chapter 7 of Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the operative event for the exchange rate shall be 1 July of the year in which the aid is granted.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
