whereas this consideration and the desirability of efficient quota administration make it appropriate for operators to be allowed to make their initial import authorization application for 1997 equivalent to the quantity (for each textile category and each third country) which they imported in 1996;\nWhereas it has also proved necessary to revise the maximum quantities previously established for certain categories in order to allow commercially significant transactions to take place;\nWhereas for optimum use of the quantities it is appropriate to envisage that each operator, after 50 % utilization of a licence, can introduce a new request for a licence, not exceeding a predetermined quantity, provided quantities are available in the quotas;\nWhereas it is appropriate for the sake of sound administration to make import authorizations valid for nine months from the date of issue and to stipulate that the Member States can issue licences only after being notified of the Commission's decision and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and certify (except where specifically provided otherwise) that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorization under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned; whereas the competent national authorities are however authorized, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 1998 licences of which at least 60 % has been used by the application date;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion expressed by the Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation specifies certain rules concerning the management of quantitative quotas established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and applicable for 1997.", "The quotas referred to in Article 1 and shown in Annexes IIIB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 shall be allocated on a 'first come, first served` basis according to the chronological order of receipt by the Commission of Member States' notifications of applications from individual operators, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities per operator stipulated in the Annex hereto.\nThese maximum quantities shall not, however, apply to operators able to prove to the competent national authorities when making their first application for 1997 that they imported, for given categories, given third countries and under import licences granted to them for 1996, more than the maximum quantities specified for each category. In the case of such operators, the competent authorities may authorize imports of no more than the quantities imported in 1996 for given third countries and given categories, provided that enough quota is available.", "Any importer who has used 50 % or more of the amount allocated to him through a licence under this Regulation may make a further application for a licence, for the same category and country of origin, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities laid down in the Annex hereto, provided that enough of the quota is available.", "The requests for import authorizations can be submitted to the Commission as of 2 January 1997 at 10 a.m., Brussels time. Import authorizations shall be valid for nine months from the date of issue, but in no case later than 31 December 1997. At the importer's request, the competent national authorities may, however, grant a three-month extension for licences which are at least 60 % used up at the time of the request. The extension must in no case last beyond 31 March 1998.\nThe competent authorities of the Member States shall issue authorizations only after being notified of the Commission's decision and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 3, certify in writing that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorization under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1997.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 December 1996.\nFor the Commission\nLeon BRITTAN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 67, 10. 3. 1994, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 255, 9. 10. 1996, p. 4.\nANNEX\nMaximum amounts referred to in Article 2\n>TABLE>"}
