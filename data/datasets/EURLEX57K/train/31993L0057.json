In such cases, the maximum level is one-tenth of the value related to fat content, but must be no less  than 0,01 mg/kg.(7) In determining the residues in raw cow's milk and whole cream cow's milk, a fat content of 4 % by weight should be taken as a basis. For raw milk and whole cream milk of another animal origin the residues are expressed on the basis  of the fat. For the other foodstuffs listed in Annex I under heading Nos 0401, 0402, 0405 00 and 0406: - with a fat content of less than 2 % by weight, the maximum level is taken as half that set for raw milk and whole cream milk, - with a fat content  of 2 % or more by weight, the maximum level is expressed in mg/kg of fat. In such cases, the maximum level is 25 times that set for raw milk and whole cream milk.(8) For eggs and egg products with a fat content higher than 10 % the maximum level is  expressed in mg/kg fat. In this case the maximum level is 10 times higher than the maximum level for fresh eggs.(9) Footnotes (1), (2) and (3) do not apply in cases where the lower limit of analytical determination is indicated.(10)() Should levels not  be adopted by 1 January 1998, the following maximum level shall apply: 0,05*."}
