Under Article\u00a05(c) of that Regulation, indications of organoleptic properties of virgin olive oils may appear on the labelling only if they are based on the results of a method of analysis provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02568/91 of 11 July 1991 on the characteristics of olive oil and olive-residue oil and on the relevant methods of analysis\u00a0(3).\n(2) The work launched by the International Olive Council (ICO) with a view to finding new organoleptic evaluation methods enabling the range of positive attributes of virgin olive oils to be expanded was concluded in November 2007. Community legislation is in the process of being brought into line with the revised method of the IOC. It would however be premature to apply Article\u00a05(c) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01019/2002 from the formal start of the 2008/09 marketing year, i.e. on 1 July 2008.\n(3) The date on which Article\u00a05(c) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01019/2002 becomes applicable should therefore be postponed until 30\u00a0November 2008, which coincides with the date on which the bottling of oils from the 2008/09 marketing year will begin.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01019/2002 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["The third subparagraph of Article\u00a012(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01019/2002 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article\u00a05(c) shall apply from 30\u00a0November 2008.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.
