whereas the special provisions necessary for the application of the system of levies fixed by tender in the olive oil sector need to be added to that Regulation;\nWhereas those special provisions either complement or derogate from those of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 193/75 of 17 January 1975 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [6], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1624/78 [7];\nWhereas, under Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2751/78 of 23 November 1978 laying down general rules for fixing the import levy on olive oil by tender [8], tenderers must submit an application for an import licence on the dates fixed by the Commission; whereas, for ease of administration these applications should be submitted in such a way that the minimum levy is calculated once a week;\nWhereas the special security should be fixed at a level permitting the system for fixing the levy by tender to function properly; whereas, for the sake of administrative simplicity, this special security should replace that provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75;\nWhereas all imports of the products in question become subject to the tendering procedure from the time when the Commission decides to apply it;\nWhereas, under Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75, no application for an import licence is required in respect of imports of products in the olive oil sector not exceeding 100 kilograms, although such imports remain subject to the levy; whereas, for the sake of administrative simplicity, this provision should be retained;\nWhereas in certain Member States traders import only small quantities; whereas, if such traders had to submit their offers under the tendering procedure, the administrative burden on the competent bodies in the Member States would be increased without any improvement in their knowledge of the market situation; whereas the tendering procedure should apply only to applications for licences relating to quantities of a product in excess of 20000 kilograms;\nWhereas, in order to avoid any risk of disturbance of the Community market, a levy should be charged in the two cases referred to above; whereas imports not exceeding 21000 kilograms should be made subject to the minimum levy applicable on the day of importation for each category of olive oil in question; whereas, in order to ensure that the levy system functions correctly, the number of applications for licences in respect of the quantities referred to above which may be submitted by any one importer should be limited; whereas to this same end such licences should be made non-transferable;\nWhereas, under Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75, import licences applied for otherwise than under the tendering procedure are subject to a waiting period of four days; whereas experience has shown that such applications for licences are rare; whereas the abovementioned waiting period is therefore unnecessary;\nWhereas, when olive oils or olives intended for the production of oil are covered either by the arrangements provided for in Council Directive 69/73/EEC of 4 March 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of inward processing [9], as last amended by Directive 76/119/EEC [10], or by the system described in Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 645/75 of 13 March 1975 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products [11], special provisions should be laid down to take account of the existence of a system of fixing levies by tender in the olive oil sector;\nWhereas, in view of the relaxation of the arrangements applicable to the import of small quantities, it is desirable to monitor more closely trade movements in respect of such quantities; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 205/73 on communications between Member States and the Commission concerning oils and fats [12], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2413/77 [13], should therefore be amended;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["1. Where the tendering procedure referred to in Article 16 (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC or in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2749/78 applies, applications for import licences in respect of olive oil shall be submitted to the competent agencies in the Member States on the Monday or Tuesday of each week.\nThe time limit for the lodging of applications shall be 4 p.m. This time limit shall expire:\n- one hour earlier in Ireland and the United Kingdom outside the period known as Summer Time in those Member States;\n- one hour later in the other Member States during the period known as Summer Time in those Member States.\nAny applications submitted after the deadline on the Tuesday, or on any other subsequent day of the week, shall be deemed to have been submitted on the Monday of the following week.\nHowever, the provisions of the preceding subparagraph shall not apply to applications submitted after the deadline on the Tuesday unless the applicant has stated in his application that he wishes them to apply.\n2.

The rate indicated on the licence shall be that referred to in Article 2 (4) (c). However, where Sections 13 and 14 of the licence issued contain the name of a non-member country with which the Community has signed an agreement, the levy actually paid by the importer shall be that referred to above adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Council Regulations:\n- (EEC) No 2164/70 of 27 October 1970 on imports of olive oil from Spain [14], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2277/71 [15],\n- (EEC) No 1180/77 of 17 May 1977 on imports of olive oil from Turkey [16], as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2387/77 [17];\n- (EEC) No 1508/76 of 24 June 1976 on imports of olive oil originating in Tunisia [18],\n- (EEC) No 1514/76 of 24 June 1976 on imports of olive oil originating in Algeria [19],\n- (EEC) No 1521/76 of 24 June 1976 on imports of olive oil originating in Morocco [20],\n- (EEC) No 2750/78 of 23 November 1978 on the standard amount for unrefined olive oil produced entirely in Greece and transported direct from that country to the Community [21].", "1. If the licence application contains the word \"Greece\" the licence shall be issued on the entry into force of the minimum levy with the word \"Greece\" in Sections 13 and 14.\n2.

In this event Sections 13 and 14 shall contain the words \"all non-member countries\".\n3.
