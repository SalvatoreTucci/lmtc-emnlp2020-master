In accordance with Article 7 of the Regulation, a Decision is therefore to be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of the Regulation.\n(3) At a meeting on 9 October 2000 experts of Groupe Danone were called upon to provide the necessary information in response to the comments and objections raised by Member States. In particular, a technical explanation was given that the high-pressure treatment provides the same level of safety as the generally used heat pasteurisation process with respect to the bacteriological risks and the allergenic potential.\n(4) It is therefore considered that the use of high-pressure pasteurisation in the production of fruit preparations is not likely to have an effect on public health so that a decision can be taken without consultation of the Scientific Committee for Food.\n(5) On this basis, it is established that the products comply with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of the Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["The fruit preparations pasteurised by high-pressure treatment, as specified in the Annex, may be placed on the market in the Community as a novel food ingredient.", "Without prejudice to the other requirements of Community law concerning the labelling of foodstuffs, the wording \"pasteurised by high-pressure treatment\" is displayed next to the fruit preparations in question as such and in any product in which it is used.", "This Decision is addressed to Groupe Danone, 7 rue de T\u00e9h\u00e9ran, F-75391 Paris CEDEX 08."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\nANNEX\nSpecifications for fruit preparations pasteurised by high-pressure treatment\n>TABLE>"}
