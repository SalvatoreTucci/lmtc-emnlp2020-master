These transactions are sometimes referred to as \u2018debt for equity swaps\u2019. The IFRIC has received requests for guidance on the accounting for such transactions.\nSCOPE\n2 This Interpretation addresses the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability. It does not address the accounting by the creditor.\n3 An entity shall not apply this Interpretation to transactions in situations where:\n(a) the creditor is also a direct or indirect shareholder and is acting in its capacity as a direct or indirect existing shareholder.\n(b) the creditor and the entity are controlled by the same party or parties before and after the transaction and the substance of the transaction includes an equity distribution by, or contribution to, the entity.\n(c) extinguishing the financial liability by issuing equity shares is in accordance with the original terms of the financial liability.\nISSUES\n4 This Interpretation addresses the following issues:\n(a) Are an entity\u2019s equity instruments issued to extinguish all or part of a financial liability \u2018consideration paid\u2019 in accordance with paragraph 41 of IAS 39?\n(b) How should an entity initially measure the equity instruments issued to extinguish such a financial liability?\n(c) How should an entity account for any difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the initial measurement amount of the equity instruments issued?\nCONSENSUS\n5 The issue of an entity\u2019s equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all or part of a financial liability is consideration paid in accordance with paragraph 41 of IAS 39. An entity shall remove a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) from its statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished in accordance with paragraph 39 of IAS 39.\n6 When equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish all or part of a financial liability are recognised initially, an entity shall measure them at the fair value of the equity instruments issued, unless that fair value cannot be reliably measured.\n7 If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured then the equity instruments shall be measured to reflect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished. In measuring the fair value of a financial liability extinguished that includes a demand feature (eg a demand deposit), paragraph 49 of IAS 39 is not applied.\n8 If only part of the financial liability is extinguished, the entity shall assess whether some of the consideration paid relates to a modification of the terms of the liability that remains outstanding. If part of the consideration paid does relate to a modification of the terms of the remaining part of the liability, the entity shall allocate the consideration paid between the part of the liability extinguished and the part of the liability that remains outstanding. The entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the transaction in making this allocation.\n9 The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished, and the consideration paid, shall be recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with paragraph 41 of IAS 39. The equity instruments issued shall be recognised initially and measured at the date the financial liability (or part of that liability) is extinguished.\n10 When only part of the financial liability is extinguished, consideration shall be allocated in accordance with paragraph 8. The consideration allocated to the remaining liability shall form part of the assessment of whether the terms of that remaining liability have been substantially modified. If the remaining liability has been substantially modified, the entity shall account for the modification as the extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability as required by paragraph 40 of IAS 39.\n11 An entity shall disclose a gain or loss recognised in accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10 as a separate line item in profit or loss or in the notes.\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n12 An entity shall apply this Interpretation for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies this Interpretation for a period beginning before 1 July 2010, it shall disclose that fact.\n13 An entity shall apply a change in accounting policy in accordance with IAS 8 from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.\nAppendix\nAmendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\nThe amendment in this appendix shall be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. If an entity applies this Interpretation for an earlier period, these amendments shall be applied for that earlier period.\nA heading and paragraph D25 are added to Appendix D.\nExtinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments\nD25 A first-time adopter may apply the transitional provisions in IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments."}
