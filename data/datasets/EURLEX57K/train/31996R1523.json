Under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (4), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, market access is to be completely liberalized with effect from 1 April 1997.\n(4) Such a period appears sufficient to allow adjustment to new market conditions, and there is no longer any justification for extending it.\n(5) In the case of interlining the following aspects must be taken into consideration:\n- according to information and documents provided by the airlines and by the International Air Transport Association, the rates resulting from tariff consultations are up to 70 % higher than market prices. The result is, in particular, that consignments covered by interlining agreements are carried at rates which are negotiated between the consignors and the carriers or their representatives and which have no real relationship with the rates resulting from the tariff consultations. It has thus been established that interlining operates in some cases with tariffs that are less than half those set during consultations,\n- it has also been established that airlines which do not take part in the tariff consultations carry cargo under interlining agreements,\n- according to information provided by the airlines, the proportion of intra-Community consignments covered by interlining agreements fell from 30 % in 1991 to 11 % at the end of 1994. In the case of some airlines, the relevant figure is less than 2 %,\n- in some cases, the very high tariffs set during tariff consultations are applied to consignors, even where there is no interlining,\n- some airlines have attempted to reform the system for setting tariffs during tariff consultations and to introduce lower tariffs, but such attempts have failed.\n(6) In view of these aspects, tariff consultations are no longer necessary to contribute to the acceptance of the general terms and conditions for interlining. These consultations also result in high tariffs being set, at the expense of users, and are no longer essential for making interlining work, given the small number of agreements concerned and the fact that they are concluded essentially on a bilateral basis.\n(7) Consultations on cargo tariffs must therefore be excluded from the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93.\n(8) Time to amend the agreements and concerted practices in question should be allowed,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 is amended as follows:\n1.
