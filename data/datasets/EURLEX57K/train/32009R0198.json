Those rules apply also to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivision to it and which is established by specific Community provisions, with a view to the application of tariff and other measures relating to trade in goods.\n(3) Pursuant to those general rules, the goods described in column\u00a01 of the table set out in the Annex should be classified under the CN code indicated in column\u00a02, by virtue of the reasons set out in column\u00a03 of that table.\n(4) It is appropriate to provide that binding tariff information which has been issued by the customs authorities of Member States in respect of the classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature but which is not in accordance with this Regulation can, for a period of three months, continue to be invoked by the holder, under Article\u00a012(6) of Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["The goods described in column 1 of the table set out in the Annex shall be classified within the Combined Nomenclature under the CN code indicated in column\u00a02 of that table.", "Binding tariff information issued by the customs authorities of Member States, which is not in accordance with this Regulation, can continue to be invoked for a period of three months under Article\u00a012(6) of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02913/92.\nArticle3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 KOV\u00c1CS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\nANNEX\nDescription of the goods Classification Reasons\n(1) (2) (3)\nArticle measuring approximately 4\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0m, made up of woven strands of plant material (sea-grass). 4601\u00a094\u00a010 Classification is determined by General Rules 1, 3(b) and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, note 1 to Chapter 46, note 1 to Chapter 57, note 3(A)(e) to Section XI and the wording of CN codes 4601, 4601\u00a094 and 4601\u00a094\u00a010.\n(1) The two intertwined twisted strands of plant material (weft) are made of vegetable materials of heading 1404 of a kind used primarily for stuffing cushions (see the Harmonised System Explanatory notes (HSEN) to heading 1404, (D), first paragraph and third paragraph, (4) which refers to \u2018eel-grass\u2019 that is a sort of sea-grass).\n(2) The single twisted strand of spun natural textile fibres of plant material (warp) are made of fibres obtained from vegetable materials. The fibres are held together by twisting (spinning) (see the HSEN to Section XI, General, (I)(B)(1)(i)(a)). These \u2018spun yarns\u2019 are to be treated as \u2018twine\u2019 of heading 5607 within the meaning of note 3(A)(e) to Section XI, because the single twisted strand measures more than 20\u00a0000 decitex (see also the distinction between yarns and twine in table I (type \u2013 of other vegetable fibres) in the HSEN to Section XI, General, (I)(B)(2) and the HSEN to heading 5308 (A), second paragraph, and the HSEN to heading 5607 (1), first paragraph).\n(3) The cellular rubber backing of Chapter 40 does not give the article its essential character within the meaning of GIR 3(b), because it is situated underneath and not visible when the article lies on the ground. It functions as backing, rendering the article stiffer, and confers anti-slip properties to the article.\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The photographs are purely for information."}
