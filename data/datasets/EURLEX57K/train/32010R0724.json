According to those provisions, Member States shall temporarily close the fishery in a certain area if a trigger catch level of a particular species, or group of species, has been reached.\n(2) The Agreed Record of the Conclusions between the European Union and Norway of 3 July 2009 lays down the procedures and sampling methodology for the adoption of real-time closures in the North Sea and Skagerrak. Those provisions were transposed into Union law by way of Council Regulation (EC) No 753/2009\u00a0(2), amending Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 and fixing for 2009 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks.\n(3) Those provisions thus introduced in Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 applied to cod, haddock, saithe and whiting caught by any fishing gear other than pelagic trawls, purse seines, driftnets and jiggers targeting herring, mackerel and horse mackerel, and pots, scallop dredges and gillnets. In addition, they specified, inter alia, the obligations of the coastal Member States regarding the decisions on real-time closures and the information to be provided to other Member States and/or third countries concerned and the Commission.\n(4) Considering that the concerned provisions ceased to apply as from 1 January 2010, it is necessary to provide for the transposition of the Agreed Record by way of detailed rules implementing Articles 51, 52 and 53 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 in the North Sea and Skagerrak.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes detailed rules for the implementation of real-time closures of certain fisheries in the North Sea and Skagerrak in accordance with Articles 51, 52 and 53 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to cod, haddock, saithe and whiting caught in the North Sea and Skagerrak by any fishing gear other than:\n(a) pelagic trawls, purse seines, driftnets and jiggers targeting herring, mackerel, and horse mackerel;\n(b) pots;\n(c) scallop dredges;\n(d) gillnets.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) zones means zones as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91\u00a0(3);\n(b) \u2018Skagerrak\u2019 means the area bounded on the west by a line drawn from the Hanstholm lighthouse to the Lindesnes lighthouse and on the south by a line drawn from the Skagen lighthouse to the Tistlarna lighthouse and from this point to the nearest point on the Swedish coast;\n(c) \u2018North Sea\u2019 means ICES zone IV;\n(d) \u2018haul\u2019 means the act between the deployment and retrieval of a net.", "Catch trigger level\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The catch level which shall trigger real-time closures of fisheries, as referred to in Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, shall be 15\u00a0% by weight of juveniles as compared to the total of the four species referred to in Article 2, in a haul.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, if the quantity of cod in the sample exceeds 75\u00a0% as compared to the total of the four species in a haul, the catch trigger level shall be 10\u00a0% by weight of juveniles as compared to the total of the four species in a haul.", "Definition of juveniles\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, \u2018juveniles\u2019 means:\n\u2014 specimens of cod smaller than 35\u00a0cm,\n\u2014 specimens of haddock smaller than 30\u00a0cm,\n\u2014 specimens of saithe smaller than 35\u00a0cm,\n\u2014 specimens of whiting smaller than 27\u00a0cm.", "Calculation of the catch level of juveniles\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of calculating the catch level of juveniles in accordance with Article 51(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, the coastal Member State and/or the Member State participating in a joint operation under a Joint Deployment Plan shall identify areas where there is a risk of reaching the trigger level.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the areas identified in accordance with paragraph 1, the coastal Member State and/or the Member State participating in a joint operation under a Joint Deployment Plan shall carry out inspections to measure whether the percentage of juveniles reaches the trigger level, including through Joint Deployment Plans.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When carrying out the inspections referred to in paragraph 2, the coastal Member State and/or the Member State participating in a joint operation under a Joint Deployment Plan shall:\n(a) take and measure samples of cod, haddock, saithe and whiting from a haul in accordance with provisions in Annex I;\n(b) document each sampling by completing a sampling report as set out in Annex II and send it to the coastal State.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may invite other countries undertaking inspections in the area concerned to carry out samples on their behalf.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coastal Member State concerned shall publish without delay on its website the position at which the sample referred to in paragraph 3(a) was taken, the time it was taken and the quantity of juveniles as a percentage of the total catch of cod, haddock, saithe and whiting in weight.
