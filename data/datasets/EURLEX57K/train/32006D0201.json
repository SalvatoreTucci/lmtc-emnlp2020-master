This instrument shall enter into force on 16 March 2006 and be terminated on 15 June 2006. For the Government of the Republic of Indonesia this legal framework is based on Indonesian Law No 2 of 1982 dated 25 January 1982 concerning the Ratification of Convention on Special Mission, 1969.\nI believe that the constructive cooperation that has been established, with a view to providing a peaceful, comprehensive and sustainable solution to the challenges facing Aceh, within the framework of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia, can be further sustained and strengthened.\nI look forward to your positive consideration.\nYours sincerely,\nDr. N.
