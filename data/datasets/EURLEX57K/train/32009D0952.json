In the light of the disease situation in certain areas of Bulgaria, Germany, France, Hungary and Slovakia, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of that Decision until 31 December 2011.\n(4) In order to prevent the spread of classical swine fever from Romania to other Member States, Commission Decision 2006/779/EC of 14 November 2006 concerning transitional animal health control measures relating to classical swine fever in Romania\u00a0(4) was adopted. That Decision is to apply until 31 December 2009.\n(5) Romania has provided information to the Commission, showing that the classical swine fever situation in that Member State has significantly improved. However, in view of the data available, additional animal health control measures should continue to apply in Romania with regard to classical swine fever. It is therefore appropriate to include Romania in Part III of the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC. The inclusion of Romania in Part III of the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC should be reviewed in the light of the results of a Union inspection to be carried out in Romania in the first semester of 2010.\n(6) To ensure the safety of fresh pigmeat and meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing fresh meat that enter the areas listed in Part III of the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC from areas not listed in that Part, the establishments which are producing, storing and processing such commodities should be approved by the competent authority and notified to the Commission. In addition, the production, storage and processing of such meat and meat products or preparations should be carried out separately from that of other products consisting of, or containing meat from holdings located in the areas listed in Part III of the Annex to that Decision.\n(7) To ensure traceability of fresh pigmeat and meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing fresh meat that enter the areas listed in Part III of the Annex to Decision 2008/855/EC from areas not listed in that Part, the meat and meat products and preparations should be marked appropriately. Therefore, the fresh pigmeat should be marked with the health mark provided for in Chapter III of Section I of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(5).
