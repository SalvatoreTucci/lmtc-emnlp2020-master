That list includes tebuconazole.\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, tebuconazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.\n(3) Denmark was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 11 January 2006 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 29 November 2007, in an assessment report.\n(5) The review of tebuconazole did not reveal any open questions or concerns to be addressed by the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks.\n(6) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing tebuconazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include tebuconazole in Annex I for product type 8, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing tebuconazole can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC. However, unacceptable risks were identified\u00a0for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood in continuous contact with water. Authorisation of these uses will require the submission of data demonstrating that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.\n(7) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that instructions are provided to indicate that treated timber must be stored after treatment on impermeable hard standing to prevent direct losses to soil and allow losses to be collected for re-use or disposal, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(d) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(8) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance tebuconazole and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n(10) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing tebuconazole to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\n(11) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 March 2009 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
