Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Intrascope (Optical Probe)'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 mm (and of 19 mm at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an  operating distance of between 3 and 45 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 60,6676   0,7972 X1 + 0,1243 X2\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,\nX2 = the weight of the hot carcase in kilograms.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 110 kg.\nPART 2   Fat-O-Meater (FOM)  1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater (FOM)', model S87.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 mm diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950/960 type and having an operating distance of between 3 and 103 mm. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat  content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 56,4512   0,5050 X1   0,3680 X2 + 0,2165 X3\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase at the last rib,\nX2 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nX3 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as X2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 110 kg.\nPART 3   Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)  1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 mm diameter (and of 6,3 mm at the blade of the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of  between 0 and 120 mm. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP II itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase should be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 57,4823   0,3576 X1   0,4496 X2+ 0,2023 X3\nwhere:\ny = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nX1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase at the last rib,\nX2 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nX3 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as X2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 110 kg."}
