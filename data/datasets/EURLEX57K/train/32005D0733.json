In order to reduce the risk of disease introduction into the Community, Commission Decision 2005/705/EC of 10 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Turkey\u00a0(3) was adopted as an immediate measure to suspend imports of birds other than poultry and untreated feathers from Turkey.\n(2) Turkey is included in the list in the Annex to Commission Decision 94/85/EC of 16 February 1994 drawing up a list of third countries from which the Member States authorise imports of fresh poultry meat\u00a0(4). Commission Decision 2003/812/EC of 17 November 2003 drawing up lists of third countries from which Member States are to authorise imports of certain products for human consumption subject to Council Directive 92/118/EEC\u00a0(5) refers to the aforementioned list.\n(3) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine\u00a0(6) provides that Member States are to authorise the import of birds from the third countries listed as members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Turkey is a member of the OIE and accordingly Member States are to accept imports of birds, other than poultry, from Turkey under that Decision.\n(4) Under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption\u00a0(7), the importation of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in Turkey, is authorised, because these products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact to susceptible animals.\n(5) In accordance with Commission Decision 2005/432/EC of 3 June 2005 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC\u00a0(8), importation from Turkey is authorised for those products which have undergone a heat treatment which ensures a minimum temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C throughout the products.\n(6) The Turkish authorities have sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission which justify a complete suspension of all imports of live poultry and birds and their products, while at the same time this information allows now to establish the conditions under which safe products of avian origin may be imported.\n(7) However, taking into account the risk formed by these products, the importation of certain animal by-products, including treated feathers and parts of feathers, treated game trophies and poultrymeat products heat-treated to a minimum temperature of 70\u00a0\u00b0C can continue to be authorised, as the treatment inactivates the specific pathogen.\n(8) It is also appropriate to continue to allow imports of pasteurised egg products for human consumption complying with the microbiological criteria laid down in Commission Decision 97/38/EC of 18 December 1996 setting specific public health requirements for imports of egg products for human consumption\u00a0(9).\n(9) Certain products derived from poultry slaughtered before 1 September 2005 should also continue to be authorised, taking into account the incubation period of the disease.\n(10) Furthermore, specimens collected from any type of birds which are safely packaged and sent directly under the responsibility of the Turkish competent authority to an approved laboratory in a Member State for laboratory diagnosis, including the tests in accordance with the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), should be authorised.\n(11) Decision 2005/705/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Member States shall suspend the importation from Turkey of:\n1. live poultry, ratites, farmed fathered game, wild game birds and live birds other than poultry as defined in Article 1, third indent, of Decision 2000/666/EC, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds);
