Furthermore, human cases and even deaths resulting from close contact with infected birds continue to occur in countries around the globe. Therefore, there remains the risk that the disease will spread from third countries to the Member States.\n(5) Therefore, apart from limiting the direct risk caused by imports of poultry, poultry products and pet birds, it is appropriate to keep in place the biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and to keep in place the early detection systems in areas at particular risk.\n(6) The period of application of those Decisions should therefore be extended until 31 December 2009.\n(7) In addition, Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 of 23 March 2007 laying down animal health conditions for imports of certain birds into the Community and the quarantine conditions thereof\u00a0(9) repeals Commission Decision 2000/666/EC\u00a0(10) and replaces the requirements relating to the quarantine of certain birds imported into the Community as laid down in that Decision.\n(8) The current references in Decision 2007/25/EC to the requirements laid down in Decision 2000/666/EC should therefore be replaced with references to the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 318/2007.\n(9) Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/731/EC, 2005/734/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 7 of Decision 2005/692/EC, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "In Article 4 of Decision 2005/731/EC, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "In Article 4 of Decision 2005/734/EC, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "Decision 2007/25/EC is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 1(1), point (b)(ii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(ii) undergo quarantine for 30 days after import into the Member State of destination on premises approved in accordance with Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007\u00a0(11), or\n2. in Article 6, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019;\n3.
