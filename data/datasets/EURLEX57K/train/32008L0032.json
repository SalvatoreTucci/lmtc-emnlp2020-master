Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2000/60/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Since the Commission has established a register of sites to form the intercalibration network referred to in section 1.4.1 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC by means of Decision 2005/646/EC\u00a0(6), it is appropriate to delete the references to expired deadlines.\n(6) Directive 2000/60/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since the amendments made to Directive 2000/60/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
