Sorbial SAS has submitted an application requesting to change the name of the authorisation holder from Sorbial SAS to Danisco France SAS as regards Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008.\n(3) The applicant claims that Sorbial SAS was converted into Danisco France SAS with effect from 18 May 2009. Danisco France SAS now owns the marketing rights for the additive. The applicant has submitted appropriate documents supporting its claims.\n(4) The proposed change of the terms of the authorisation is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additive concerned. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(5) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the name of Danisco France SAS it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisations.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In column 2 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1290/2008 the name \u2018Sorbial SAS\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Danisco France SAS\u2019.", "Existing stocks which are in conformity with the provisions applying before the date of entry into force of this Regulation may continue to be placed on the market and used until six months after that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 340, 19.12.2008, p. 20."}
