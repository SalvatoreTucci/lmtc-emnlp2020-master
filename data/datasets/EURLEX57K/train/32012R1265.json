The application was accompanied by the relevant supporting data. The Commission forwarded that application to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019).\n(3) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 24 May 2012\u00a0(3) that the new enzyme solid formulation is not expected to introduce hazards to the target species, consumers, users or the environment not already considered and it is efficacious at the minimum activity of 10\u00a0000 FYT/g. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(5) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 837/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 837/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 252, 19.9.2012, p. 7.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(6):2730.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 837/2012 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
