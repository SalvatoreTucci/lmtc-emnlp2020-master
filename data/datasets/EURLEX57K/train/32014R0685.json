The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01331/2008.\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority evaluated the safety of PVA-PEG graft co-polymer when used as a food additive and concluded that its use in food supplements as film coating is of no safety concern for the proposed uses\u00a0(4).\n(6) PVA-PEG graft co-polymer is intended for use in aqueous instant-release film coatings for food supplements. It protects against unpleasant tastes or odours, improves appearance, makes tablets easier to swallow, gives a distinctive appearance, and protects sensitive active ingredients. A specific property of the substance is that it is extremely flexible, has low viscosity, and dissolves rapidly in acidic, neutral, and alkaline aqueous media. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of PVA-PEG graft co-polymer as a glazing agent in solid food supplements and to assign E 1209 as E-number to that additive.\n(7) The specifications for PVA-PEG graft co-polymer should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union lists of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.\n(8) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a083, 22.3.2012, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(8):3303.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Part B, point 3 \u2018Additives other than colours and sweeteners\u2019, the following new entry is inserted after the entry for food additive E 1208 Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer:\n\u2018E 1209 Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer\u2019\n(2) in Part E, in food category 17.1 \u2018Food supplements supplied in a solid form including capsules and tablets and similar forms, excluding chewable forms\u2019, the following new entry is inserted after the entry for food additive E\u00a01208:\n\u2018E 1209 Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer 100\u00a0000\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, the following new entry is inserted after the entry for E 1208 (Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer):\n\u2018E 1209 POLYVINYL ALCOHOL-POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL-GRAFT-COPOLYMER\nSynonyms Macrogol poly(vinyl alcohol) grafted co-polymer; poly(ethan-1,2-diol-graft-ethanol); ethenol, polymer with oxirane, graft; oxirane, polymer with ethanol, graft; ethylene oxide-vinyl alcohol graft co-polymer\nDefinition Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer is a synthetic co-polymer that consists of approximately 75 % PVA units and 25 % PEG units.\nCAS number 96734-39-3\nChemical name Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer\nChemical formula\nWeight Average Molecular Weight 40\u00a0000 to 50\u00a0000 g/mol\nDescription White to faintly yellow powder\nIdentification\nSolubility Freely soluble in water and dilute acids and dilute solutions of alkali hydroxides; practically insoluble in ethanol, acetic acid, acetone, and chloroform\nIR Spectrum Must comply\npH value 5,0-8,0\nPurity\nEster Value 10 to 75 mg/g KOH\nDynamic viscosity 50 to 250 mPa\u0387s\nLoss on drying Not more than 5 %\nSulphated Ash Not more than 2 %\nVinyl Acetate Not more than 20 mg/kg\nAcetic acid/Total Acetate Not more than 1,5 %\nEthylene glycol Not more than 50 mg/kg\nDiethylene glycol Not more than 50 mg/kg\n1,4-Dioxane Not more than 10 mg/kg\nEthylene oxide Not more than 0,2\u00a0mg/kg\nArsenic Not more than 3 mg/kg\nLead Not more than 1 mg/kg\nMercury Not more than 1 mg/kg\nCadmium Not more than 1 mg/kg\u2019"}
