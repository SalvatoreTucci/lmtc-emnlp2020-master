That application is therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The additive diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5\u00a0% Premix) is already authorised by Commission Regulations (EC) No 2430/1999\u00a0(3) for chickens for fattening, (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(4) for turkeys for fattening and (EC) No 162/2003\u00a0(5) for chickens reared for laying.\n(6) New data were submitted by the holder of the authorisation of the additive in support of an application for authorisation for ten years as coccidiostat for rabbits. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) delivered two opinions\u00a0(6) on the safety of the use of that coccidiostat for humans, animals and environment, under the conditions set out in the Annex to this Regulation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation, as specified in Annex, should be authorised for ten years.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances\u2019, as specified in the Annex, is authorised for use for ten years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 296, 17.11.1999, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 62, 2.3.2001, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 26, 31.1.2003, p. 3.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed on a request from the European Commission on the safety and efficacy of \u2018Clinacox 0,5\u00a0%\u2019 based on diclazuril for rabbits for fattening and breeding, The EFSA Journal (2007) 506, 1-32.\nUpdated Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the safety of \u2018Clinacox 0,5\u00a0%\u2019 (diclazuril) used in rabbits for fattening and breeding, The EFSA Journal (2008) 697, 1-9.\nANNEX\nRegistration number of additive Name and registration number of person responsible for putting additive into circulation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff\nCoccidiostats and other medicinal substances\nE 771 Janssen Pharmaceutica nv Diclazuril 0,5 g/100 g Additive composition:\nDiclazuril: 0,5 g/100 g\nSoybean meal: 99,25 g/100 g\nPolyvidone K 30: 0,2 g/100 g\nSodium hydroxide: 0,0538 g/100 g\nDiclazuril C17H9Cl3N4O2, (\u00b1)-4-chlorophenyl[2,6-dichloro-4-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-triazin-2-yl) phenyl]acetonitrile,\nCAS number: 101831-37-2\nDegradation compound (R064318): < 0,2\u00a0%\nOther related impurities (R066891, R066896, R068610, R070156, R068584, R070016): < 0,5\u00a0% individually\nTotal impurities: < 1,5\u00a0%"}
