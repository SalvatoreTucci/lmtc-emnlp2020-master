Given that data can be entered in all official languages of the Community, a numeric code should be used so that devices can be easily searched.\n(7) The Global Medical Device Nomenclature that has been developed based on EN ISO 15225:2000 Nomenclature \u2014 Specification for a nomenclature system for medical devices for the purpose of regulatory data exchange is such an internationally recognised nomenclature. The need to establish and maintain Eudamed and to start implementing the Global Medical Device Nomenclature as a basis for that databank was recalled in the Council Conclusions of 2 December 2003 on Medical Devices\u00a0(4).\n(8) An appropriate transitional period is necessary to allow Member States to prepare for the mandatory use of Eudamed and to take account of the changes introduced by Directive 2007/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 amending Council Directive 90/385/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices, Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market\u00a0(5).\n(9) Member States should only be required to enter data existing before 1 May 2011 to the extent required for the future functioning of Eudamed. It is necessary for the completeness of Eudamed to enter data existing before 1 May 2011 on the manufacturer, the authorised representative and on device registration, which are required by Directives 93/42/EEC and 98/79/EC, in the form in which such data are available at national level.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Medical Devices,", "main_body": ["This Decision establishes the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) as databank for the purposes of Article 10b(3) of Directive 90/385/EEC, Article 14a(3) of Directive 93/42/EEC and Article 12(3) of Directive 98/79/EC.", "Member States shall ensure that the data referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 10b(1) of Directive 90/385/EEC, points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 14a(1) of Directive 93/42/EEC and points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 12(1) of Directive 98/79/EC, are entered into Eudamed in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.\nFor clinical investigations Member States shall ensure that an extract of the notifications referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 90/385/EEC and in Article 15(1) of Directive 93/42/EEC, as well as the information referred to in Article 10(3) and (4) of Directive 90/385/EEC and in Article 15(6) and (7) of Directive 93/42/EEC are entered into Eudamed in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "Eudamed shall use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and the Extensible Mark-up Language (XML).", "When entering data in Eudamed, Member States may choose between on-line data entry and up-loading of XML files.\nMember States shall ensure that when entering data into Eudamed medical devices are described using a code from an internationally recognised nomenclature for medical devices.", "As concerns data existing before the date referred to in Article 6, Member States shall ensure that the data on registration of manufacturers, authorised representatives and devices are entered into Eudamed in accordance with Article 14a(1)(a) of Directive 93/42/EEC and Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 98/79/EC.\nThat data shall be entered by 30 April 2012 at the latest.", "Member States shall apply this Decision from 1 May 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0189, 20.7.1990, p.\u00a017.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0169, 12.7.1993, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0331, 7.12.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a020, 24.1.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0247, 21.9.2007, p.\u00a021.\nANNEX\nTable detailing the mandatory data fields in the respective module in the Eudamed databank according to the obligations arising from Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EC\nDirective 93/42/EEC Minimum data required for Eudamed data entry\n1.
