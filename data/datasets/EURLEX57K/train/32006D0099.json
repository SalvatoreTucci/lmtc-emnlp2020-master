As the apparatus \u2018Fat-O-Meater\u2019 has never been used in Northern Ireland, it should be deleted from the scope of this Decision concerning Northern Ireland.\n(3) The evaluation of this request has revealed that the conditions for using the new formulae and the new methods are fulfilled.\n(4) Decision 2004/370/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["Decision 2004/370/EC is amended as follows:\n1.

Point 3 of Part 1 (Intrascope (Optical Probe)) is replaced by the following:\n\u20183. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat percentage in the carcase,\nx = the thickness of the backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (known as \u201cP2\u201d)\n2. Point 3 of Part 2 (Mark II Ulster Probe) is replaced by the following:\n\u20183. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat percentage in the carcase,\nx = the thickness of the backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (known as \u201cP2\u201d)\n3. Part 3 is replaced by the following:\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cHennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade of the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat percentage in the carcase,\nx = the thickness of the backfat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (known as \u201cP2\u201d)\n4. The following Part 4 is added:\n1. Pig carcase grading shall be carried out using the apparatus termed Autofom (Fully automatic ultrasonic carcass grading).\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 16,2 MHz ultrasonic transducers (Krautkr\u00e4mer, SFK 2 NP), with an operating distance between transducers of 25\u00a0mm.\n3. The carcase's lean meat content shall be calculated on the basis of 127 measurement points using the following formula:\n= the estimated lean meat content of the carcase,\nip1-ip127 = Input parameters of Autofom image analysis\nb0-b127 = Constants from the model calibration\n\u2013\u00a01,6866978E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7395384E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,9907279E-002\n\u2013\u00a08,5862307E-003\n\u2013\u00a01,7233329E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,2928455E-002\n\u2013\u00a07,2069578E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n0,0000000E+000\n9,9210571E-003\n\u2013\u00a02,7280254E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,1866679E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,6877903E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,3714309E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,2873893E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,2976709E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,9736953E-002\n0,0000000E+000\n\u2013\u00a01,0441692E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,6023159E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,6019909E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,2085976E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,0802582E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,2004912E-002\n4,9544591E-003\n2,1012272E-003\n3,5626963E-003\n5,4210355E-003\n2,8231265E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n3,4462682E-003\n4,9613826E-003\n3,1486694E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n3,3405393E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n0,0000000E+000\n1,0592665E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n0,0000000E+000\n2,3835478E-003\n0,0000000E+000\n\u2013\u00a02,3957171E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,6251475E-002\n0,0000000E+000\n\u2013\u00a02,1446949E-002\n0,0000000E+000\n\u2013\u00a02,4741126E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,2376098E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,6962735E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,8594572E-002\n\u2013\u00a01,9001560E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7471537E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,2565221E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1170983E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,9708274E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7283320E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,5577871E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,2280222E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1662315E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,3039205E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,2290529E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,0902216E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,9116826E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,5646536E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,3514079E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7472775E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,6122212E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,3694078E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7969513E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,8660055E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,8413385E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,2624107E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,2517981E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1576648E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1543616E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1162977E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,0734278E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,4127805E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,4164313E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,4327772E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,4017213E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,3313580E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,3459395E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,4075206E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,5336761E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,6048595E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,6499119E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,6947299E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7433341E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1328205E-002\n\u2013\u00a03,1818397E-002\n\u2013\u00a02,7329659E-002\n6,0837399E-003\n6,8703182E-003\n7,7951970E-003\n8,3265398E-003\n7,6311678E-003\n6,6542262E-003\n5,8027613E-003\n8,4376512E-003\n8,3114961E-003\n8,2320096E-003\n8,0569442E-003\n7,7763004E-003\n7,6648975E-003\n7,3420489E-003\n7,2652618E-003\n7,1755257E-003\n7,1458751E-003\n7,1670651E-003\n6,9467919E-003\n7,0396927E-003\n7,2869365E-003\n5,7384889E-003\n7,6241307E-003\n7,3343012E-003\n6,9868541E-003\n6,6073379E-003\n6,9390922E-003\n6,3295597E-003\n6,0446505E-003\n1,0994689E-002\n9,2938738E-003\n4,4189114E-003\n4,3836362E-003\n4,6389205E-003\n4.
