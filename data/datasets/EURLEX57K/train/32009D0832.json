Those EPAs are progressively being signed since 1 January 2008.\n(3) Article 39 of Protocol I concerning the definition of the concept of \u2018originating products\u2019 and methods of administrative cooperation (Origin Protocol) of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the CARIFORUM States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part\u00a0(2) \u2014 the first EPA signed with the ACP States \u2014 provides for a procedure for granting derogations from the rules of origin on request by an ACP State signatory to the EPA. Derogations should be adopted by a competent Committee. It is appropriate to provide for a procedure for establishing the Community position within that Committee in such a way that it can also apply to similar provisions of Origin Protocols to other EPAs to be signed with ACP States in the future.\n(4) Article 39(8) of the Origin Protocol provides that a decision should be reached as soon as possible and in any case not later than 75 working days after the request is received by the Community. If the Community does not inform the ACP State having submitted a request for derogation of its position within this period, the request will be deemed to have been accepted.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to adopt a procedure ensuring that the Community position can be adopted and communicated to the ACP States signatories to EPAs sufficiently in advance for ensuring that the relevant decision may be taken before the expiry of that deadline.\n(6) Council Decision 2000/399/EC of 16 June 2000 on the procedure concerning derogations from the rules of origin set out in Protocol No 1 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement\u00a0(3) provided for a delegation of powers to the Commission with regard to the adoption of a common position of the Community following a request by ACP States for derogation from the rules of\u00a0origin laid down in Protocol 1 to Annex V to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\n(7) A similar delegation of powers to the Commission should now be provided for with regard to requests for derogations from the rules of origin laid down in the Origin Protocols of EPAs.\n(8) Decision 2000/399/EC should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["The Community position with regard to a request presented by ACP States signatory to Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) for derogation from the rules of origin laid down in the Origin Protocols to EPAs shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall be assisted by the Customs Code Committee set up by Article 248a(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Customs Code Committee a draft Community position, within 25 working days from the receipt of a request for derogation by the Community.
