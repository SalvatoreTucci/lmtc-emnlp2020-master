Many of these projects will run well until after 31 December 2008.\n(2) The Agency should become responsible also for the projects receiving financial aid on the basis of the Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), as this Regulation continues to finance similar actions for the trans-European transport network as under Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95, for which the Agency already received delegation.\n(3) The Agency should not become responsible for the adoption of individual decisions granting Community financial aid. However, in order to further increase the efficiency and effectiveness of programme implementation, the Commission may decide to delegate to the Agency the adoption of amendments to such decisions.\n(4) The Agency should in particular become responsible for project-related activities independently of the form and method of the Community financial aid defined in Article 6 of the Regulation (EC) No 680/2007. All programme-related activities, such as controlling and policymaking should be excluded and remain with the Commission.\n(5) The Agency should in particular become also responsible for accompanying measures to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the TEN-T programme, in order the maximise its European added value, including promotion of the TEN-T programme to all parties concerned and the improvement of its visibility to the general public, in the Member States and bordering third countries. Such measures could consist of targeted awareness raising and promotion campaigns, including the organisation of TEN-T days, workshops and conferences, announcement and dissemination of results and best practice through adequate publications, including the use of the electronic media, by for instance the preparation of press releases, guidance to potential applicants, brochures on success stories and annual reports, and organisation of the participation of representatives of the agency and/or the Commission at relevant events, such as the inauguration of transport infrastructure.\n(6) An updated cost-benefit analysis has been carried out by external consultants showing that the administrative resources, in particular the staffing, of the existing Agency require a significant increase. The Agency would continue to be the most cost-effective option.\n(7) Decision 2007/60/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The provisions set out by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/60/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
