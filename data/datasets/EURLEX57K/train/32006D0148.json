There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread to other holdings thus reducing sharply the profitability of poultry farming, to wild birds and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products.\n(2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries adjacent to the Community or populated by migratory birds during winter. The likelihood of virus introduction with wild birds is increasing during the forthcoming migratory season.\n(3) Early detection systems and biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of avian influenza to poultry flocks are in place in France.\n(4) In its opinion on \u2018Animal health and welfare aspects of avian influenza\u2019 of 20 September 2005 the Animal Health and Welfare Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that preventive vaccination can be considered if a high risk of virus introduction is identified in densely populated poultry areas. However, such a practice should not jeopardise the strict biosecurity and other measures that should be in force in such areas aimed at eradicating any introduction of virus.\n(5) On 21 February 2006, France has submitted to the Commission for approval a plan for preventive vaccination in the light of the particular risk of introduction of avian influenza in certain areas of its territory. The Commission has immediately examined this plan in collaboration with France and deems that after certain adaptations it is in conformity with the relevant Community provisions. It appears therefore appropriate to approve this plan.\n(6) According to this plan France intends to vaccinate ducks and geese against highly pathogenic avain influenza H5N1. This should be considered as a \u2018pilot project\u2019 since there is limited experience with preventive vaccination in these species.\n(7) Only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) or Regulation No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency\u00a0(3) should be used.\n(8) Where preventive vaccination is carried out in France monitoring on vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks and movement restrictions for vaccinated birds have to be implemented.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter, scope and definitions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Decision lays down certain measures to be applied in France where preventive vaccination is carried out in certain poultry holdings in defined areas at particular risk for introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 including provisions for movements of vaccinated poultry and certain products derived thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of this Decision the definitions in Article 2 of Council Directive 2005/94/EC shall apply as appropriate.", "Approval of the vaccination programme\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plan for preventive vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, submitted by France to the Commission on 21 February 2006, is approved (\u2018the preventive vaccination plan\u2019).\nThe preventive vaccination shall be carried out with inactivated heterologous vaccine of avian influenza subtypes H5 authorised by France in ducks and geese in the areas listed in the Annex (\u2018the preventive vaccination areas\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intensive monitoring and surveillance, as set out in the preventive vaccination plan shall be carried out in the preventive vaccination areas.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The preventive vaccination plan shall be implemented efficiently.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall publish the preventive vaccination plan.", "Provisions for movements of live poultry, hatching eggs, day-old chicks, fresh poultry meat, minced meat, meat preparations, mechanically separated meat and meat products\nProvisions for movements of live poultry and hatching eggs coming from and/or originating from holdings in which preventive vaccination is carried out and on movement of day-old chicks and fresh poultry meat, minced meat, meat preparations, mechanically separated meat and meat products derived from poultry vaccinated in accordance with the preventive vaccination plan shall meet the requirements laid down in Article 4 to 9 of this Decision.", "Provisions for movements and dispatch of live poultry, hatching eggs and day-old chicks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority shall ensure that vaccinated poultry may only be moved from its holding to:\n(a) other holdings where vaccination is carried out;
