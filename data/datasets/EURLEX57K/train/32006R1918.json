Provision should therefore be made for import licences to be issued between January and October according to a monthly schedule.\n(6) Taking into account the advantage of the zero rate duty, the security for import licenses issued in the framework of tariff quotas opened under this Regulation should be fixed at a higher amount than that fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1345/2005.\n(7) For the sake of clarity, Commission Regulation (EC) No 312/2001 of 15 February 2001 laying down detailed rules of application for the importation of olive oil originating in Tunisia and derogating from certain provisions of Regulations (EC) No 1476/95 and (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(8) should be repealed.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Olive Oils and Table Olives,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, Regulation (EC) No 1345/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply without prejudice to the provisions of this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tariff quota, bearing order number No 09.4032 is opened in relation to imports into the Community of virgin olive oil falling within CN codes 1509\u00a010\u00a010 and 1509\u00a010\u00a090, wholly obtained in Tunisia and transported directly from that country to the Community, subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.
