The basic amount of the refund shall be fixed each month for the products listed in Article 1 (1) (d) of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC.\n2. The basic amount for the products referred to in paragraph 1, with the exception of sorbose, shall be equal to one-hundredth of the amount established by taking into account:  (a) the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community area with the largest surplus for the month for which the basic amount is fixed, and the quotations or prices for white sugar recorded on the world market;\n(b) the need to establish a balance between:\n- the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries, and\n- the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements.

In the case of sorbose, the basic amount of the refund shall be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one-hundredth of the production refund valid pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 765/68 for the products listed in Annex I to that Regulation.\n4. The basic amount of the refund may not be altered between monthly fixings unless the spot price for 100 kilogrammes of white sugar quoted on the Paris Bourse is more than 0.60 units of account higher or lower than the spot price quoted on the day on which the basic amount in force was fixed.\nThe variation of the basic amount of the refund may not exceed one-hundredth of the difference between the spot prices referred to in the first subparagraph.\n5. The application of the basic amount of the refund may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1 (1) (d) of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC.\n\"", "The words \"for the month in which the product in question is exported\" shall be deleted from Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 766/68.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 22 April 1969.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
