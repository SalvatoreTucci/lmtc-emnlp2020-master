Therefore these countries should be recognised as protected zones for Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) Barr.\n(2) From information supplied by Denmark based on updated surveys, Denmark should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus as it appears that this harmful organism is now established in Denmark.\n(3) From information supplied by Estonia based on updated surveys, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is not present in the territory of Estonia. Therefore, Estonia should be recognised temporarily as a protected zone for this organism.\n(4) From information supplied by the United Kingdom based on updated surveys for the presence of Dendroctonus micans Kugelan, it appears that this harmful organism is now established in some parts of the United Kingdom but not in Northern Ireland, nor in the Isle of Man or Jersey. The protected zone should therefore be modified and restricted to Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\n(5) From information supplied by Italy based on updated surveys and from additional information collected by the Food and Veterinary Office during a mission in Italy in May 2004, it appears that this harmful organism is now established in this country. Italy should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV).\n(6) From information supplied by Sweden, it appears that some names of counties in Sweden recognised as protected zone for Leptinotarsa decemlineata may need to be corrected typographically.\n(7) Directive 2001/32/EC\u00a0(2) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2001/32/EC is amended as follows:\n1. at the end of Article 1 the following paragraph is added:\n2. the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 14 May 2005 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
