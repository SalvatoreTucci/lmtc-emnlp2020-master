whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the minimum price to be paid to producers, the non-member country price and, if necessary, the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis; whereas, in respect of tomato concentrates, preserved whole peeled tomatoes and tomato juices the volume of imports makes the non-member country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid for these products must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price;\nWhereas Article 1 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 989/84 (6) fixed as the guarantee threshold for each year a quantity of processed tomato products corresponding to 4 700 000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes; whereas Community production calculated in accordance with Article 2 (2) of that Regulation exceeds the threshold for the 1985/86 marketing year and the production of each group of tomato-based products is higher than the quantity specified in the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of the same Regulation; whereas the production aid for the 1986/87 marketing year must be reduced for such products pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the same Regulation;\nWhereas, as regards Greece, pursuant to Article 103 of the Act of Accession of Greece and until the first move towards alignment of prices, the minimum price to be paid to Greek producers is to be established on the basis of prices paid in Greece to national producers, over the reference period defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 41/81 (7); whereas that price must be aligned with the level of the common prices pursuant to Article 59 of that Act;\nWhereas, as regards Greece, the said Article 103 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/84 (8) lay down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid;\nWhereas the minimum price to be paid to producers in Spain and Portugal and the production aid for the products obtained shall be determined as provided for in Articles 118 and 304 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas the representative period for determining the minimum price for tomatoes intended for certain uses is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 461/86 of 25 February laying down, on account of the accession of Spain and Portugal, rules on the production aid system in respect of processed fruit and vegetables (9); whereas as a consequence of Article 1 (2) of that Regulation no production aid can be paid during the transitional period for preserved whole peeled tomatoes and frozen whole tomatoes obtained from the San Marzano variety grown in Portugal;\nWhereas Articles 118 (3) (b) and 304 (3) (b) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal provide that the grant of production aid to tomato-based products is to be limited to specific quantities; whereas to ensure equitable allocation of raw material to each of the production regions of the Community, it should be laid down that tomatoes grown in a specific region only attract production aid when processed in that region;\nWhereas Article 4 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1709/84 (1) provides that, inter alia, during the 1986/87 marketing year the production aid to be paid for tomato concentrate packed in containers with a weight, including immediate packing, of less than 1,5 kilograms is to be increased by a percentage; whereas this increase is based on the processing cost involved in the packing; whereas these costs are considered as identical in all Member States; whereas the increase should also be identical in all Member States; whereas to that end specific percentages should be fixed for Spain, Portugal and Greece;\nWhereas the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["For the 1986/87 marketing year:\n(a) the minimum price referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 to be paid to producers for the products listed in Annex I;
