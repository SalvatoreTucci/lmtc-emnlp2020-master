In some Member States, this requirement could create difficulties for small, low-income holdings, where egg production is often only a sideline. As the possibility of selling these table eggs on local public markets is of great economic and social importance for such holdings, Member States should be permitted to exempt them from the compulsory marking requirement. A derogation should therefore be laid down to this end for holdings with up to 50 laying hens.\n(2) Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The last subparagraph of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u2018However, eggs sold by the producer on a local public market shall carry the code defined in Article 7(1)(a). Member States may exempt producers of eggs whose holding does not exceed 50 laying hens from this requirement, provided that those eggs are sold on a local public market in the region of production of the Member State concerned and that the name and address of the holding are indicated at the place of sale.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 21 June 2005.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
