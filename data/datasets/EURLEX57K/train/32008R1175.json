Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006\u00a0(2) complemented that framework by introducing detailed implementing rules.\n(2) Article 57(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 gives details on the implementation of Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 regarding the application rules on State aids in cases of financial contributions provided by Member States as counterpart of Community support and Article 89 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 regarding additional national funding outside the scope of Article 36 of the Treaty. It is appropriate to include certain measures relating to forestry in this Article. Moreover, point 9.B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(3) Article 63(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 provides details on the exchange of data between the Commission and the Member States in cases of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, and in particular of malfunctioning of the system or a lack of a lasting connection. In order to make full use of available technical tools it is practical to allow the submission of documents by other appropriate electronic means in addition to the submission of hard copies.\n(4) Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 fixes the conversion rates of animals to livestock units as referred to in Article 27(13) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01974/2006. Regarding the conversion rate for \u2018other poultry\u2019 a typing error occurred. In order to take into account the specificities of certain poultry it should be made possible to increase that conversion rate. Annex V should therefore be adapted.\n(5) Article 44a of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3) obliges Member States to ensure annual ex-post publication of the beneficiaries of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the amounts received by the beneficiary under each of these Funds. Commission Regulation (EC) No 259/2008 of 18 March 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the publication of information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)\u00a0(4) provides rules as regards the content, form and date of the publication of information on beneficiaries. The second subparagraph of point 2.1 in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 establishes certain responsibilities for the Managing Authority to publish information about the beneficiaries receiving support from rural development programmes. In order to avoid overlapping provisions on the same subject matter it is appropriate to delete the second subparagraph of point 2.1 in Annex\u00a0VI to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Rural Development Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
