It should therefore be included in Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(2) The SCCP concluded in the same opinion that Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate HCl is safe for the consumers, when used up to a maximum authorised concentration of 0,4\u00a0% as a preservative in cosmetic products. However, the Committee considered that it should not be used in lip products, oral products and spray due to mucosal and respiratory tract irritation potential. It should therefore be included along with these restrictions in Annex VI to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(3) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes III and VI to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1 September 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
