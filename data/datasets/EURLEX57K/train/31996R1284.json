Request for a review\n(1) The Commission has received an application for a 'new exporter` review pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Basic Regulation`). The application was lodged on 31 October 1995 by Kipas AS, Turkey, an exporter in Turkey which claims it did not export the product concerned during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based with regard to the determination of dumping, i.e. the period from 1 January to 31 December 1989 (hereinafter referred to as 'the original investigation period`).\nB. Product\n(2) The products concerned are single and multiple (folded) or cabled yarns containing 85 % or more by weight of polyester staple fibres, not put up for retail sale, falling within CN codes 5509 21 10, 5509 21 90, 5509 22 10 and 5509 22 90 and other yarns of staple fibres mixed mainly or solely either with artificial staple fibres or with cotton, not put up for retail sale, falling within CN codes 5509 51 00 and 5509 53 00. These codes are given for information only and have no binding effect on the classification of the product.\nC. Existing measures\n(3) By Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 (2), the Council imposed, inter alia, a definitive anti-dumping duty of 10,1 % on imports of the product concerned originating in Turkey, with the exception of several companies especially mentioned, which are subject to a lesser duty.\nD. Grounds for the review\n(4) The applicant, Kipas AS, Turkey, has shown that it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in Turkey which are subject to the aforementioned anti-dumping measures on the product concerned, and that it actually started exporting to the Community after the original investigation period. The applicant has further shown that it entered into a long-term contract to export a significant quantity of the product concerned to the Community.\n(5) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment.\n(6) In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a review pursuant to Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.\nE. Repeal of the duty in force and registration of imports\n(7) Pursuant to Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force shall be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned originating in Turkey which are produced and exported by the applicant. At the same time, such imports shall be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14 (5) of that Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a determination of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liability is not susceptible to estimation at this stage of the proceeding.\nF. Time limit\n(8) In the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which interested parties, provided that they can show that they are likely to be affected by the results of the investigation, may make their views known in writing and provide supporting evidence. A period should also be fixed, within which interested parties may make a written request for a hearing, giving particular reasons why they should be heard. Furthermore, it should be noted that in cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the relevant time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available,", "main_body": ["Pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, a review of Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 is hereby initiated in order to determine if and to what extent imports of single and multiple (folded) or cabled yarns containing 85 % or more by weight of polyester staple fibres, not put up for retail sale, falling within CN codes 5509 21 10, 5509 21 90, 5509 22 10 and 5509 22 90 and other yarns of staple fibres mixed mainly or solely, either with artificial staple fibres or with cotton, not put up for retail sale, falling within CN codes 5509 51 00 and 5509 53 00, originating in Turkey, produced and exported by Kipas AS, Gaziantep Yolu \u0102\u009czeri P.K. 125, 46200 Kahramanmaras, Turkey, shall be subject to the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 830/92.", "The anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 is hereby repealed with regard to imports of the product identified in Article 1 (Taric additional code: 8896).", "The customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports identified in Article 1.
