whereas, pursuant to Articles 79 and 246 of that Act, the Community aid in Spain and Portugal should be aligned  on the common aid at the beginning of the marketing year; whereas the rules on that alignment would result in different Spanish and Portuguese aid rates; whereas, however, taking into account the advance application of the common intervention price in  those two countries, the same amount of aid should be applied in Spain and Portugal as from the 1993/94 marketing year;\nWhereas, in accordance with Articles 5 (4) and 20d (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the percentages of production aid to be allocated to finance measures to improve the quality of olive-oil production and to finance expenditure incurred in the work done  by recognized producer organizations or associations thereof in administering and controlling olive-oil production aid, should be determined;\nWhereas Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3416/90 of 27 November 1990 on the introduction of Community aid for the consumption of olive oil in Spain and Portugal (7) lays down criteria for adjusting this aid to the Community level;\nWhereas the application of those criteria in Spain and Portugal would entail a serious distortion of the market, given the fact that application of the common intervention price in Spain from 1 January 1993 and in Portugal from 1 April 1993 has led to  the abolition of the 'accession' compensatory amounts applicable to trade to and from these countries; whereas, as a result, the criteria in Regulation (EEC) No 3416/90 should be derogated from as regards the amounts of consumption aid applicable in  Spain and Portugal, and these should be brought into line with the aid applicable in the Community of Ten;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 11 (5) and (6) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, a certain percentage of the consumption aid during each olive-oil marketing year is to be used, on the one hand, to finance measures by the recognized trade organizations referred  to in paragraph 3 of the abovementioned Article and, on the other hand, to finance measures to promote olive-oil consumption in the Community; whereas the said percentages for the 1993/94 marketing year should be fixed;\nWhereas the situation on the olive oil market makes it possible to continue the readjustment of consumption aid and production aid begun during the 1991/92 marketing year,", "main_body": ["1.
