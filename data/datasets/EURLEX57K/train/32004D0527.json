In conformity with the Joint Declaration annexed to the Protocol on ACP sugar the European Community has examined your request and has come to the conclusion that Burkina Faso is at present not in a position to fulfil on a permanent basis the obligations of the Protocol. In previous cases, the capacity to fulfil these obligations was defined by the fact that the country in question was a net exporter of sugar.\nI regret therefore that the Community cannot accept Burkina Faso's request to join the Sugar Protocol.\nA copy of this letter is sent to the Secretary General of the ACP States.\nPlease accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration.\nOn behalf of the Council of the European Union"}
