In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) The production of woody dicotyledonous plants and their fruit occupies an important place in Community agriculture.\n(3) The yield of that production is constantly threatened by harmful organisms.\n(4) Through the protection of such plants against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but also agricultural productivity increased.\n(5) Protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into individual Member States would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading.\n(6) One of the organisms most harmful to woody dicotyledonous plants is San Jos\u00e9 Scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus Comst.).\n(7) This pest has occurred in several Member States and there are contaminated areas within the Community.\n(8) There is a permanent risk to the cultivation of woody dicotyledonous plants throughout the Community if effective measures are not taken to control this pest and prevent it from spreading.\n(9) To eradicate this pest, minimum provisions should be adopted for the Community. Member States should be able to adopt additional or stricter provisions where necessary.\n(10) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the timelimits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B,", "main_body": ["This Directive concerns the minimum measures to be taken within the Member States to
