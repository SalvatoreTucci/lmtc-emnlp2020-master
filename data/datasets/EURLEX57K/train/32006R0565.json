After consultation of those manufacturers and importers, the rapporteurs have determined that it is necessary for the purposes of the risk evaluation to require those manufacturers and importers to submit further information and carry out further testing.\n(2) The information needed to evaluate the substances in question is not available from former manufacturers or importers. The manufacturers and importers have checked that tests on animals cannot be replaced or limited by using other methods.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to request manufacturers and importers of priority substances to submit further information and carry out further testing of those substances. The protocols submitted by the rapporteurs to the Commission should be used for performing those tests.\n(4) The provisions of this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93,", "main_body": ["The manufacturers and importers of the substances listed in the Annex, who have submitted information in accordance with the requirements of Articles 3, 4, 7 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93, shall provide the information and perform the tests indicated in the Annex and shall deliver the results to the relevant rapporteurs.\nThe tests shall be performed according to the protocols specified by the rapporteurs.\nThe results shall be delivered within the time limits laid down in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 April 2006.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 84, 5.4.1993, p. 1.
