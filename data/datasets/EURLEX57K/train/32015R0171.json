The national licensing authorities should inform the European Railway Agency of licences that have been issued, suspended, revoked or amended and the latter should inform the other Member States accordingly. A common template for the licence would facilitate the work of the national licensing authorities and of the European Railway Agency and provide easier access to information on licences by all interested parties, in particular the licensing authorities of other Member States and the infrastructure managers.\n(3) All necessary information that confirms that a given railway undertaking has been regularly licensed for a certain type of rail transport services can be contained within a standardised document. The standard template for the licence document would facilitate publication of all relevant information on licences on the website of the European Railway Agency. The standard format could be modified in the future depending on experience of its use and the development of the needs for further information on licences.\n(4) The conditions under which the requirements referred to in Article 22 of Directive 2012/34/EU relating to cover for civil liability may be fulfilled may vary between Member States depending on national law. Evidence that the railway undertaking meets these national requirements should be provided for by an annex to the licence document. The standard template for this annex should be used for this purpose. In case the railway undertaking wishes to exercise its activities in two or more Member States, the cover for civil liability for each of these Member States should be mentioned in an additional annex, which should be supplied by the licensing authority in the additional Member State the railway undertaking wishes to operate in.\n(5) Licensing authorities may reduce their administrative costs, the level of licensing fees and the time to make a decision on an application for a licence if they swiftly exchange the necessary data with other authorities and other public or private entities.\n(6) Due to little movement in the market, no licensing decisions are taken in some Member States for one or more consecutive years. At the same time, high fees may pose an obstacle to market entry of railway undertakings.\n(7) Railway undertakings which apply for a new licence should not face less favourable licensing conditions than the railway undertakings already operating in the market.\n(8) Unnecessary administrative burden imposed on licensing authorities and undertakings should be reduced by strictly limiting the requirements to the conditions set out in Directive 2012/34/EU.\n(9) The licensing authorities have no obligation to request a licensing fee from a railway undertaking. However Member States may decide to impose such a fee for the work undertaken by the licensing authorities on the examination of the application. In such a case the licensing fee should be non-discriminatory, be effectively levied on all the undertakings applying for a licence and be based on the actual workload of the licensing authority. If the licensing fee exceeds EUR 5\u00a0000, the licensing authority should set out the number of person hours employed and the expenditure in the payment note for the fee.\n(10) In an attempt to create a level playing field between railway undertakings, Directive 2012/34/EU has repealed certain arrangements that are not compatible with enhancing market conditions, whereby railway undertakings have to be insured or have adequate guarantees under market conditions. Licensing authorities should be invited to verify the implementation of the revised conditions in cooperation with other authorities of Member States.\n(11) The granting of a licence to a railway undertaking should not be conditional on it holding a safety certificate referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3).\n(12) New railway undertakings are critical for competition, but they may have practical difficulties to provide a track record on their financial fitness which allows them to establish realistic assumptions for a period of 12 months in the future according to Article 20(1) and (2) of Directive 2012/34/EU. Whilst EU legislators have created the option of simplified proof for certain smaller air carriers according to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), the procedure for obtaining a licence may take account of these practical difficulties by alleviating the procedure for demonstrating financial fitness for railway undertakings that apply for a licence.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 62(1) of Directive 2012/34/EU,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation sets out the details for the use of a common template for the licence document.

It may also request such evidence from the railway undertakings in case it has doubts whether their cover meets the requirements referred to in Article 22 of Directive 2012/34/EU.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In case the undertaking does not demonstrate that it is adequately insured, but that it has adequate guarantees for cover, the licensing authority, if appropriate after consultation of the regulatory body, shall examine whether the conditions under which the undertaking has obtained such guarantees correspond to market conditions which would have been obtained by any other undertaking with the same level of financial standing and risk exposure.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the licensing authority suspends the licence in accordance with Article 24(1) of Directive 2012/34/EU, or grants a temporary licence in accordance with Article 24(3) of the said Directive, it shall inform any other competent authorities referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6), with which it knows that the railway undertaking had contracted services. If the licensing authority has doubts regarding the compatibility of the guarantees for cover of its liabilities with the Union rules on State aid, it may transmit the necessary information to the authorities responsible for the control of such State aid rules.", "Relation with safety certificates\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The granting of a licence may not be conditional on the undertaking holding a safety certificate referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If an undertaking holds a safety certificate, the licensing authority shall not check requirements for safety certificates, when granting the licence.", "Certain aspects of the procedure for granting a licence\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within one month of the receipt of the application, the licensing authority shall inform the undertaking that the file is complete or ask for complementary information.
