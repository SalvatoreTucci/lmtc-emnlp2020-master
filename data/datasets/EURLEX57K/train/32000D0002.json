this plan must be updated at the request of the Commission, particularly when the checks referred to in Article 29(3) of the abovementioned Directive render it necessary;\n(4) where the requirements of the paragraph above are not complied with, inclusion of a third country on the lists of third countries laid down by Community legislation may be suspended in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 of Council Directive 96/23/EC;\n(5) the application of residue monitoring plans, and the follow up to evidence of the use of unauthorised substances or of residue levels exceeding the Community maximum residue limits, are necessarily to protect public health;\n(6) the United States of America had agreed to take remedial action measures to rectify deficiencies identified the design and implementation of their residue monitoring programme; these measures were communicated to the Commission;\n(7) in the light of the measures notified by the United States of America, the Commission carried out a mission to verify the adequacy and effectiveness of these measures;\n(8) the verification mission carried out by the Commission revealed serious problems as regards the implementation and the enforcement of the residue monitoring programme in place in the United States of America, and demonstrated that the programme does not provide the guarantees concerning the protection of public health against risks from residues as required by the European Community; whereas the United States of America has agreed to take further action to rapidly remedy the deficiencies;\n(9) in circumstances like those described above, the relevant Community legislation and international agreements applicable in this case enable the European Community to suspend imports from the United States of America;
