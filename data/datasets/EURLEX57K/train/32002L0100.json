On crops where no uses are authorised the MRLs were set at the lower limit of analytical determination (LOD). In general, use of azoxystrobin would result in residues in excess of the LOD. Thus when a new use of it is proposed, Member States are required to establish a new national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before such a new use of a plant protection product containing this active substance may be authorised. Information relating to additional uses has accordingly been submitted by certain Member States. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to modify provisional maximum residue levels at Community level in respect of the crops on which Member States now propose to authorise the use of plant protection products containing azoxystrobin.\n(4) With respect to the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of azoxystrobin, the technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of a Commission review report on 22 April 1998. This fixed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the substance at 0,1 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with azoxystrobin was assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(10) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(11) on the methodology employed and it is calculated that the new MRLs now proposed will not lead to the ADI being exceeded.\n(5) The Community notified the draft Commission Directive to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received have been considered in finalising the Directive.\n(6) Account has been taken of the opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular of its advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides.\n(7) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) This Directive is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The maximum pesticide residue levels for azoxystrobin in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC shall be replaced by the maximum pesticide residue levels in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
