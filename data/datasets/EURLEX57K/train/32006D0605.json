Such poultry are bred in captivity and then released into the wild in order to be hunted and serve as a source of wild feathered game meat.\n(4) Farming concerning poultry intended for restocking wild game supplies often involves contact with wild birds and might therefore pose an increased risk for the spread of avian influenza in particular when dispatched to other Member States or third countries.\n(5) Experiences with outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 and other avian influenza strains of H5 and H7 subtypes have shown that that category of poultry is particularly at risk and that additional measures should be taken to reduce such risks.\n(6) Accordingly it is appropriate that Member States draw up guidelines for good biosecurity practices for that type of poultry production, detailing and complementing the measures provided for in Decision 2005/734/EC in particular as regards holdings from which poultry are dispatched to other Member States or third countries.\n(7) Directive 2005/94/EC sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and early detection of avian influenza. That Directive requires the implementation of surveillance programmes for avian influenza in poultry holdings. The guidelines for good biosecurity practices, additional biosecurity measures and testing prior to the dispatch of poultry provided for in this Decision should give further guarantees for trade and exports in live poultry and reduce the risk of spreading the disease.\n(8) Laboratory investigations should be carried out in accordance with the procedures laid down in Commission Decision 2006/437/EC of 31 August 2006 approving a Diagnostic Manual for avian influenza as provided for in Council Directive 2005/94/EC.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Decision provides for:\n(a) biosecurity measures to be applied on holdings keeping poultry intended for restocking supplies of wild game; and\n(b) surveillance measures to be applied when productive poultry intended for restocking supplies of wild game, are dispatched to other Member States or third countries.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018poultry\u2019 means fowl, turkeys, guinea fowl, ducks, geese, quails, pigeons, pheasants and partridges and ratites (Ratitae) reared or kept in captivity for breeding, the production of meat or eggs for consumption, or for re-stocking supplies of game;\n(b) \u2018productive poultry\u2019 means poultry 72 hours old or more, reared for the production of meat and/or eggs for consumption or for restocking supplies of game;\n(c) \u2018wild game\u2019 means wild birds that are hunted for human consumption.", "Guidelines for good biosecurity practices\nMember States, in collaboration with producers keeping poultry for restocking supplies of wild game, shall develop guidelines for good biosecurity practices for such holdings taking into account the biosecurity measures of Decision 2005/734/EC (\u2018guidelines for good biosecurity practices\u2019).", "Conditions for dispatch of poultry for restocking supplies of wild game\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the dispatch to other Member States or third countries of productive poultry intended for restocking wild game supplies is only authorised if the holding of dispatch was:\n(a) subjected to an inspection by the official veterinarian confirming that the holding complies with the guidelines for good biosecurity practices; and\n(b) during the two-month period preceding the date of dispatch of the poultry,\n(i) either included in the official surveillance programme for avian influenza as provided for in Article 4 of Directive 2005/94/EC;\n(ii) subjected to a serological investigation, with negative results for the avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7, in each case on samples taken at random from the flock of origin from which the consignment is to be drawn, as follows:\n\u2014 50 samples in case of ducks or geese, or\n\u2014 20 samples in case of other poultry;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the dispatch to other Member States or third countries of productive poultry intended for restocking wild game supplies and which is less than one month old, is only authorised if:\n(a) the holding of dispatch complied with the conditions of paragraph 1; and\n(b) a virological investigation for avian influenza is carried out either by virus isolation or PCR on 20 cloacal swabs and 20 tracheal or oropharyngeal swabs from the poultry to be dispatched, during the one-week period preceding the date of dispatch.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that before dispatching the productive poultry referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the health examination of the flock of origin required by Article 10a(1)(c) of Directive 90/539/EEC is carried out during the 24 hours preceding the time of dispatch of the consignment.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State shall ensure that the laboratory tests provided for in paragraphs 1(b) and paragraph 2 of this Article are carried out in accordance with the Diagnostic Manual established in accordance with Article 50(1) of Directive 2005/94/EC.", "Certification\nMember States shall ensure that the health certificates provided for in Article 17 of Directive 90/539/EEC accompanying consignments of poultry intended for restocking wild game supplies dispatched to other Member States must be completed by the following:\n\u2018This consignment complies with the animal health conditions laid down in Commission Decision 2006/605/EC.\u2019", "Compliance measures\nMember States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
