Pursuant to Article 32.5 of the Statute, the sum of the NCBs\u2019 monetary income is allocated to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB. In order to allow for a gradual adaptation of the NCBs\u2019 balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, the monetary income allocation for the financial years 2002 to 2007 has been adjusted to take into account the differences between the average value of banknotes in circulation of each NCB during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 and the average value of banknotes that would have been allocated to them during that period in accordance with the ECB\u2019s capital key. These adjustments include net intra-Eurosystem liabilities on euro banknotes in circulation which are in the liability base for the purposes of calculating the NCBs\u2019 monetary income under Article 32.2 of the Statute, as they are equivalent to banknotes in circulation.\n(2) The future enlargement of the Eurosystem makes it necessary to adapt the existing regime for the allocation of monetary income. For reasons of fairness, consistency and equal treatment, new Eurosystem NCBs should be treated in the same way financially as existing Eurosystem NCBs. This means that an adjustment procedure should be applied each time a Member State adopts the euro and should follow the same principles as the adjustment procedure for the financial years 2002 to 2007. As a consequence, overlapping of adjustment periods may occur.\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro\u00a0(2) allows new participating Member States some flexibility as regards the substitution of the euro for their currencies and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins. In order for the adjustment procedure to achieve financially appropriate solutions, the individual changeover scenarios have to be taken into account,", "main_body": ["Decision ECB/2001/16 is amended as follows:\n1.
