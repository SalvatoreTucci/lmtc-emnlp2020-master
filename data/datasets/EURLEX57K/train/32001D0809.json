It provides that net lending/net borrowing of general government is not to include amounts of taxes and social contributions unlikely to be collected.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 Member States may ask the Commission for a transitional period of no more than two years in which to bring their accounting systems into line with that Regulation.\n(4) By letter dated 9 August 2001, the Danish authorities have requested a transitional period of two years to bring their accounting systems into line with Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000.\n(5) Denmark has for many years based the recording of taxes and social contributions in its national accounts on assessment and declarations. It has provided to the Commission sufficient objective evidence of the need for Denmark to improve its knowledge of the receipt of those amounts in order to bring its accounting systems into line with Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000. Such an improvement requires the involvement of all the public national authorities concerned.\n(6) The request by Denmark should therefore be granted,", "main_body": ["Denmark is granted a transitional period in order to bring its accounting systems into line with Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 no later than 7 December 2002.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 November 2001.\nFor the Commission\nPedro Solbes Mira\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 290, 17.11.2000, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 310, 30.11.1996, p. 1."}
