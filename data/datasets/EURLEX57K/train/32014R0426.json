In some Member States, this type of spirit drink is traditionally produced also with other fruits, which are not included in that list. Therefore the list of fruits or berries used for the production of spirit drinks under that category should be extended.\n(2) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 provides that the spirit drinks of the category 24 \u2018Akvavit or aquavit\u2019 are caraway and/or dillseed-flavoured spirit drinks flavoured with a distillate of plants or spices. Those spirit drinks are traditionally produced by using ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. The current category of spirit drink \u2018Akvavit or aquavit\u2019 does not specify the obligation to use ethyl alcohol. However, using ethyl alcohol in the production of \u2018Akvavit or aquavit\u2019 is essential to ensure the quality of the product.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Spirit Drinks,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a039, 13.2.2008, p.\u00a016.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in point (a) of category 16, point (ii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(ii) obtained from the following fruits or berries:\n\u2014 blackberry (Rubus fruticosus auct. aggr.),\n\u2014 strawberry (Fragaria spp.),\n\u2014 bilberry/blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.),\n\u2014 raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.),\n\u2014 redcurrant (Ribes rubrum L.),\n\u2014 white currant (Ribes niveum Lindl.),\n\u2014 blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.),\n\u2014 sloe (Prunus spinosa L.),\n\u2014 rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia L.),\n\u2014 service-berry (Sorbus domestica L.),\n\u2014 hollyberry (Ilex aquifolium and Ilex cassine L.),\n\u2014 checkerberry (Sorbus torminalis (L.)
