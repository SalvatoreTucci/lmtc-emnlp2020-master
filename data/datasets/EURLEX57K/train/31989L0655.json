They must not give rise to any hazard as a result of any unintentional  operation.\nIf necessary, from the main control position, the operator must be able to ensure that no person is present in the danger zones. If this is impossible, a safe system such as an audible and/or visible warning signal must be given automatically whenever  the machinery is about to start. An exposed worker must have the time and/or the means quickly to avoid hazards caused by the starting and/or stopping of the work equipment.\nControl systems must be safe. A breakdown in, or damage to, control systems must not result in a dangerous situation.\n2.2.\nIt must be possible to start work equipment only by deliberate action on a control provided for the purpose.\nThe same shall apply:\n- to restart it after a stoppage for whatever reason,\n- for the control of a significant change in the operating conditions (e.g. speed, pressure, etc.),\nunless such a restart or change does not subject exposed workers to any hazard.\nThis requirement does not apply to restarting or a change in operating conditions as a result of the normal operating cycle of an automatic device.\n2.3.\nAll work equipment must be fitted with a control to stop it completely and safely.\nEach work station must be fitted with a control to stop some or all of the work equipment, depending on the type of hazard, so that the equipment is in a safe state. The equipment's stop control must have priority over the start controls. When the work  equipment or the dangerous parts of it have stopped, the energy supply of the actuators concerned must be switched off.\n2.4.\nWhere appropriate, and depending on the hazards the equipment presents and its normal stopping time, work equipment must be fitted with an emergency stop device.\n2.5.\nWork equipment presenting risk due to falling objects or projections must be fitted with appropriate safety devices corresponding to the risk.\nWork equipment presenting hazards due to emissions of gas, vapour, liquid or dust must be fitted with appropriate containment and/or extraction devices near the sources of the hazard.\n2.6.\nWork equipment and parts of such equipment must, where necessary for the safety and health of workers, be stabilized by clamping or some other means.\n2.7.\nWhere there is a risk of rupture or disintegration of parts of the work equipment, likely to pose significant danger to the safety and health of workers, appropriate protection measures must be taken.\n2.8.\nWhere there is a risk of mechanical contact with moving parts of work equipment which could lead to accidents, those parts must be provided with guards or devices to prevent access to danger zones or to halt movements of dangerous parts before the  danger zones are reached.\nThe guards and protection devices must:\n- be of robust construction,\n- not give rise to any additional hazard,\n- not be easily removed or rendered inoperative,\n- be situated at sufficient distance from the danger zone,\n- not restrict more than necessary the view of the operating cycle of the equipment,\n- allow operations necessary to fit or replace parts and for maintenance work, restricting access only to the area where the work is to be carried out and, if possible, without removal of the guard or protection device.\n2.9.\nAreas and points for working on, or maintenance of, work equipment must be suitably lit in line with the operation to be carried out.\n2.10.\nWork equipment parts at high or very low temperature must, where appropriate, be protected to avoid the risk of workers coming into contact or coming too close.\n2.11.\nWarning devices on work equipment must be unambiguous and easily perceived and understood.\n2.12.\nWork equipment may be used only for operations and under conditions for which it is appropriate.\n2.13.\nIt must be possible to carry out maintenance operations when the equipment is shut down. If this is not possible, it must be possible to take appropriate protection measures for the carrying out of such operations or for such operations to be carried  out outside the danger zones.\nIf any machine has a maintenance log, it must be kept up to date.\n2.14.\nAll work equipment must be fitted with clearly identifiable means to isolate it from all its energy sources.\nReconnection must be presumed to pose no risk to the workers concerned.\n2.15.\nWork equipment must bear the warnings and markings essential to ensure the safety of workers.\n2.16.\nWorkers must have safe means of access to, and be able to remain safely in, all the areas necessary for production, adjustment and maintenance operations.\n2.17.\nAll work equipment must be appropriate for protecting workers against the risk of the work equipment catching fire or overheating, or of discharges of gas, dust, liquid, vapour or other substances produced, used or stored in the work equipment.\n2.18.\nAll work equipment must be appropriate for preventing the risk of explosion of the work equipment or of substances produced, used or stored in the work equipment.\n2.19.\nAll work equipment must be appropriate for protecting exposed workers against the risk of direct or indirect contact with electricity.\n3.\nMinimum additional requirements applicable to specific work equipment,\nas referred to in Article 9 (1) of the Directive."}
