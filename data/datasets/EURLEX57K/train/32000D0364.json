Since Commission Decision 95/196/EC of 4 May 1995 on the long-term national aid scheme for agriculture in the northern regions of Finland(2), as amended by Decision 97/279/EC(3), already provides for this possibility, the Commission considers this request to be justified, in particular in the interest of avoiding any discrimination between producers in different parts of Finland.\n(6) The second request concerns the bovine sector and would entail the deletion of the upper limit of 90 male bovine animals eligible for aid on each holding. Since, in accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(4), Finland has decided not to apply this upper limit under the common organisation of the market, it appears appropriate to remove the limit in respect of national aid as well. Furthermore, Finland has explained that such a limit is also contrary to the aim of improving production structures in southern Finland, which is one of the prerequisites for the full integration of Finnish agriculture into the common agricultural policy.\n(7) The third request also concerns the bovine sector and is intended to harmonise the terminology used to define the conversion factors for livestock units with that used in Decision 95/196/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999; this request appears justified in the interests of transparency and administrative simplification.\n(8) Decision 2000/167/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2000/167/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
