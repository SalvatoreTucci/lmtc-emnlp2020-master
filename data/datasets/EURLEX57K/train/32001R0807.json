However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.\n(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.\n(6) Cefoperazone, cyhalothrin, lincomycin, nafcillin, netobimin, phoxim, tiamulin and cyfluthrin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(7) \"Linear alkyl benzene sulphonic acids with alkyl chain lengths ranging from C9 to C13, containing less than 2,5 % of chains longer than C13\" should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.\n(8) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for cefacetrile, oxolinic acid and permethrin.\n(9) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 60th day following its publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 April 2001.\nFor the Commission\nErkki Liikanen\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 35.\n(3) OJ L 317, 6.11.1981, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 139, 10.6.2000, p. 25.\nANNEX\nA.
