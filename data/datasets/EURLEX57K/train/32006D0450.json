That letter stipulated that the measures would be cancelled once a democratically elected and accountable president and government had been installed.\nThe European Union is pleased to see that the new government elected in October and November 2005 appears determined to introduce democratic change and reform the working of the public sector. The European Union is particularly pleased that:\n\u2014 the parliamentary and presidential elections of October and November 2005 were free, transparent and fair,\n\u2014 freedom of expression and press freedom are respected,\n\u2014 the government is backing, and actively taking part in, the implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP).\nA number of difficulties are nevertheless delaying performance of the government's commitments in the area of human rights and the rule of law, as follows:\n\u2014 the Commission on Human Rights is in the process of being reorganised following the appointment of new commissioners by the government,\n\u2014 few prosecutions have been brought against members of the security forces guilty of serious human rights violations,\n\u2014 the new security forces are not yet fully operational,\n\u2014 the overhaul of the justice system is still under way,\n\u2014 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be operational in June 2006, but the budget allocated to it is not sufficient to enable it to perform all its tasks.\nFurther progress is therefore needed in the area of human rights and the rule of law.\nIn view of the above, the European Union believes that the Liberian government is showing the right attitude and a satisfactory determination to improve the situation in the country. The European Union would like to encourage the Liberian government to continue down this road.\nIt is therefore convenient to lift the appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nAn enhanced, structured political dialogue based on Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement will be conducted in order to continue strengthening respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance. The political dialogue will concern:\n\u2014 follow-up of action against corruption and implementation of the GEMAP,\n\u2014 the progress made by the Commission on Human Rights and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,\n\u2014 the reforms of the justice and security sectors,\n\u2014 ensuring active follow-up of the results of external audits of parastatal agencies and government financial institutions,\n\u2014 the prosecution of those involved in violations of human rights.\nAt their first meeting in the framework of the enhanced Article 8 political dialogue, the parties will establish the commitments to be given by the Liberian government.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
