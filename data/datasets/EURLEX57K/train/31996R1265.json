These measures shall include, in particular:\n(i) special control and inspection programmes;\n(ii) effort plans, including lists of authorized vessels and, when deemed necessary on the basis of quota exhaustion beyond the level of 70 %, limitations on the activity of the authorized vessels;\n(iii) restrictions on transhipment and on other practices which incur discarding;\n(iv) where possible, temporary prohibition to fish in areas where high bycatch rates of herring, in particular juveniles, are detected.", "Member States shall notify the Commission of the detailed specifications of the sampling programmes referred to in Article 2, including the list of harbours where sampling facilities exist, and of the detailed measures mentioned in Article 3 before 10 July 1996. On receipt of the notifications, the inspectors authorized by the Commission shall, wherever the Commission deems it necessary, carry out independent inspections in order to verify the implementation of these measures by the competent authorities.", "Notwithstanding Article 15 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 (5), Member States shall communicate to the Commission, by Tuesday of each week, the landings of herring covered by Article 1 made in the preceding week.", "The Commission shall prohibit landings of herring if it is deemed that the implementation of the measures mentioned in Articles 2 and 3 do not constitute a sufficient guarantee that a strict control of fishing mortality of herring in all fisheries is achieved.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities and shall be applicable for six months thereafter.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 July 1996.\nFor the Commission\nEmma BONINO\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 389, 31. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 226, 29. 8. 1980, p. 48.\n(3) OJ No L 330, 30. 12. 1995, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 144, 18. 6. 1996, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 261, 20. 10. 1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nTotal allowable catch to be landed sorted (in tonnes, live weight).
