The reference to Directive 84/450/EEC should therefore be removed from the Annex and replaced by a reference to the specific Articles of Directive 2006/114/EC which aim at protecting consumers\u2019 interests.\n(5) Whilst Directive 87/102/EEC\u00a0(6) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/48/EC\u00a0(7), Directive 2008/48/EC does not expressly state that references to the repealed Directive 87/102/EEC are to be construed as references to Directive 2008/48/EC. For reasons of legal certainty, the reference to Directive 87/102/EEC in the Annex should therefore be replaced by a reference to Directive 2008/48/EC.\n(6) Directive 89/552/EEC\u00a0(8) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2010/13/EU\u00a0(9). Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 34 of Directive 2010/13/EU, references to Directive 89/552/EEC are to be construed as references to Directive 2010/13/EU. However, for the sake of clarity, the reference to Directive 89/552/EEC in the Annex should be replaced by a reference to the relevant Articles of Directive 2010/13/EU.\n(7) Directive 93/13/EEC\u00a0(10) was not amended by Decision 2002/995/EC\u00a0(11). Therefore, the reference to that Decision should be removed from the Annex.\n(8) Directive 94/47/EC\u00a0(12) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/122/EC\u00a0(13). Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 18 of Directive 2008/122/EC, references to Directive 94/47/EC are to be construed as references to Directive 2008/122/EC. However, for the sake of clarity, the reference to Directive 94/47/EC in the Annex should be replaced by a reference to Directive 2008/122/EC.\n(9) Directive 97/55/EC\u00a0(14) is an amending Directive to the repealed Directive 84/450/EEC. Therefore, the reference to Directive 97/55/EC should be removed from the Annex.\n(10) The Annex should be amended accordingly.\n(11) It is necessary to assess the effectiveness and operational mechanisms of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02006/2004 and thoroughly examine the possible inclusion in the Annex of additional laws that protect consumers\u2019 interests, with a view to a possible revision of that Regulation aimed at providing public enforcement authorities with improved means to effectively detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of infringements harming the collective interests of consumers in cross-border situations. To that end, the Commission should submit as soon as possible, and in any event by the end of 2014, a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a02006/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the following Article is inserted:\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 14 September 2011.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
