Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (NCIMB 10415) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening and for pigs for fattening by the Commission Regulation (EC) No 866/1999\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Penicillium funiculosum (IMI SD 101) was provisionally authorised for the first time for laying hens and for turkeys for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10 W) was provisionally authorised for the first time for turkeys for fattening, by Regulation (EC) No 418/2001. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) and subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 2107) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999\u00a0(5). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) and endo-1,4-beta- xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI SD 135) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(10) The use of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 528.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets (weaned) and for pigs for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2374/98\u00a0(6). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.\n(11) The assessment of those applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(7).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised for use without a time-limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in Annex II, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 June 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
