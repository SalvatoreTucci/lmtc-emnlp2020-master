whereas therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the pigmeat  sector which should in particular include provisions for the submission of the applications and the  information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for  the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing licences for  agricultural products  (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95  (4);\nWhereas, in order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for  export licences under the said system should be fixed; whereas in view of the risk of speculation  inherent in the system in the pigmeat sector, export licences should not be transferable and  precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down;\nWhereas Article 13 (11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that compliance with the  obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences;  whereas therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of  licences should be laid down;\nWhereas, in addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be  communicated only after a period of consideration; whereas this period would allow the Commission  to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate,  to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending; whereas  it is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the  acceptance coefficient has been fixed;\nWhereas, in the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the  export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it; whereas these licences,  however, should benefit from refunds only in accordance with the measures which the Commission  might possibly have taken for the period in question;\nWhereas in order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from  the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 should be laid down;\nWhereas the Commission must dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and  of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system; whereas, in the interests  of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made  according to a uniform model;\nWhereas to avoid any interruption of exports at the time of entry into force of the Agreement on  Agriculture of the Uruguay Round, authorization should be given for export licences to be applied  for and issued before the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, out for use after that  date;\nWhereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1700/84 of 18 June 1984 laying down  detailed rules for implementing the system of advance fixing certificates for refunds in the  pigmeat sector  (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1022/95  (6), are replaced by the  provisions of this Regulation; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1700/84 should therefore be repealed as  from the date of entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["As from 1 July 1995, all exports of products in the pigmeat sector  for which an export refund is requested, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence  with advance fixing of the refund.", "1.

A  suspension for a longer period may be decided in accordance with the procedure provided for in  Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75. In these cases, applications for export licences lodged  during the suspension period shall be inadmissible.\nThese measures may be adjusted according to the category of product.\n5.  Where quantities applied for are rejected or reduced, the security shall be released  immediately for all quantities for which an application was not satisfied.\n6.  Notwithstanding paragraph 3, where a single percentage of acceptance less than 80  % is set,  the licence shall be issued at the latest by the 11th working day following publication of that  percentage in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
