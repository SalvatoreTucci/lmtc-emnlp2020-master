In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) The application of noise emission standards to civil subsonic jet aeroplanes has significant consequences for the provision of air transport services, in particular where such standards limit the useful life of aeroplanes operated by airlines.\n(3) Council Directive 89/629/EEC of 4\u00a0December 1989 on the limitation of noise\u00a0emission from civil subsonic jet aeroplanes\u00a0(5) limits the addition to the civil air registers of Member States of aeroplanes that comply only with the standards specified in Part\u00a0II, Chapter\u00a02, Volume 1 of Annex\u00a016 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second\u00a0edition\u00a0(1988). That Directive specifies that the limitation on addition is only\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0stage.\n(4) Owing to the problem of growing congestion at Community airports, it is essential to ensure that the best use is made of existing facilities. This will only be possible if environmentally acceptable aeroplanes are used.\n(5) The work undertaken by the Community in cooperation with other international bodies indicates that measures to limit the operation of aeroplanes which do not comply with the standards of Chapter\u00a03 of Annex\u00a016 must follow any non-addition rule in order for this to be of environmental benefit.\n(6) Common rules for this purpose should be introduced on a reasonable time-scale to ensure a harmonised approach throughout the Community, supplementing existing rules. This is particularly important in view of the recent trend towards progressive liberalisation of European air traffic.\n(7) Aeroplane noise should be reduced, taking into account environmental factors, technical feasibility and economic consequences.\n(8) It is appropriate to regulate the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which appear on Member States' registers and comply with the standards of Chapter\u00a03 of Annex\u00a016.\n(9) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(10) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex\u00a0I, Part B,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of this Directive is to regulate the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes as specified in Article\u00a02.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to aeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass of 34\u00a0000\u00a0kg or\u00a0more or with a certified maximum internal accommodation for the aeroplane type in question consisting of more than nineteen passenger seats, excluding any seats for crew only.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that all civil subsonic jet aeroplanes operating from airports situated in their territory comply with the standards specified in Part\u00a0II, Chapter\u00a03, Volume\u00a01 of Annex\u00a016 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second\u00a0edition\u00a0(1988).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The territory referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall not include the overseas departments referred to in Article\u00a0299(2) of the Treaty.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may grant exemptions from Article\u00a02 for aeroplanes of historical interest.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any Member State granting exemptions under paragraph\u00a01 shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission of the fact and of the grounds for its decision.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every Member State shall recognise the exemptions granted by another Member State in\u00a0respect of aeroplanes entered on the registers of the latter.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In individual cases, Member States may permit the temporary use, at airports situated in their territory, of aeroplanes which cannot be operated on the basis of the other provisions of this Directive.
