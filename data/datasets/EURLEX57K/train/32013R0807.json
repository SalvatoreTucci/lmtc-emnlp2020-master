It is necessary to bring the rules on price recording in line with the needs of the beef sector. Regulation (EC) No 2273/2002 should therefore be repealed and replaced.\n(2) In order to have a complete picture of the market situation at all times, it is necessary to know the prices of certain categories of bovine animals other than those covered by price reporting under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008\u00a0(3).\n(3) In order to improve data accuracy, provision should be made for a survey of prices for male calves aged between eight days and four weeks, for store cattle aged more than six months and less than two years and calves slaughtered at the age of less than eight months. Therefore, detailed rules on the information to be provided for the price survey for each of those bovine animal categories should be established.\n(4) The Member States with an important share in the production and trade of those different categories of bovine animals and the information to be provided by them for the price survey for each of those categories should be established.\n(5) The price recorded on the representative Union markets should be taken as the average of the prices of the bovine animals in question on the representative market or markets of each Member State. That average should be weighted in accordance with coefficients expressing the relative size of the relevant cattle population of each Member State for each category marketed in a reference period.\n(6) In order to obtain comparable prices of the categories of bovine animals concerned in the Union, it is necessary to provide that the price recording should refer to a well-defined marketing stage based on the quotations excluding value added tax.\n(7) Moreover, the Union reference presentation of carcasses of slaughtered calves should be determined. In that context, it is appropriate to provide that certain corrective factors need to be specified by Member States to adjust the presentations used to the Union reference presentation.\n(8) The representative market or markets for each Member State should be selected. Where there is more than one representative market in a Member State, account should be taken of the weigthed average of the prices recorded on those markets.\n(9) In order to ensure that prices reported are representative of national production, it is necessary to allow Member States to designate for price recording natural or legal persons who trade or send for slaughter substantial numbers of the relevant categories of bovine animals.\n(10) In the absence of price recording on public markets or by operators of slaughterhouses, or by designated natural or legal persons, it should be provided that prices are recorded by chambers of agriculture, quotation centres, farmers\u2019 cooperatives or farmers\u2019 unions and other reliable sources in the Member State concerned.\n(11) In case Member States have established regional committees to determine prices of certain categories of bovine animals, provision should be made that the prices determined by those committees may be taken into account in the national price calculation, provided that their membership ensures a balanced and objective approach.\n(12) With a view to monitoring the reporting of prices of the relevant categories of bovine animals, Member States should be obliged to communicate periodically certain information to the Commission.\n(13) Provision should be made for the weekly communication to the Commission of the national average prices through electronic means of transmission.\n(14) Member States may, because of veterinary or health protection regulations, find it necessary to take measures which affect quotations. In such circumstances, it is not always suitable when recording market prices to take into account quotations which do not reflect the normal trend of the market. Consequently, certain rules should be laid down allowing the Commission to authorise the Member State concerned to disregard the prices recorded or to use the last prices recorded.\n(15) It is necessary to provide that Member States have to take certain measures in order to ensure the representativeness and accuracy of the reported prices. Moreover, Member States should inform the Commission of those measures.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The average Union price, per head, of male calves aged between eight days and four weeks shall be the average of the prices
