In the light of the report of this expert group, and the factors set out below, the Commission considers that certain products should be allowed in organic farming, and the use of ethylene should be extended.\n(4) Spinosad is a new insecticide from microbial origin that is found to be essential for the control of some key-pests and contributes to the sustainability of the production system for other crop-pest situations. However, when using it, the risk to non-target organisms should be minimised.\n(5) In relation to the inclusion of spinosad, it needs to be clarified that micro-organisms are generally allowed in organic farming for pest and disease control, while products produced by micro-organisms need to be listed individually.\n(6) Potassium bicarbonate is found to be essential against various fungal diseases in a range of crops and may contribute to the reduction of the use of copper and sulphur in certain crop-pest combinations.\n(7) Copper octanoate is a new formulation of copper that can be used for the same purpose as other copper compounds already included in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. The total amount of copper to be applied per season is lower when copper octanoate is used.\n(8) Ethylene is already included in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 as a substance of traditional use in organic farming. It has appeared appropriate to complete the conditions for use of that substance with two additional uses that are deemed to be essential: degreening of citrus fruits, when such a treatment is part of a strategy to prevent fruit fly damage, and sprouting inhibition of stored potatoes and onions.\n(9) Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 May 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
