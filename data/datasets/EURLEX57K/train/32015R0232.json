It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter 'the Authority', on 8 June 2012.\n(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of copper compounds on 22 May 2013\u00a0(5).\n(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for copper compounds.\n(7) In the light of the additional information provided by the notifier, the Commission considered that the further confirmatory information required had not been fully provided and that, in particular, the specific provision of row 277 of Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, concerning monitoring programmes for contamination by copper, is not sufficient to conclude on the environmental risk assessment.\n(8) It is confirmed that the active substance copper compounds is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is, in particular, appropriate to require that the notifier presents to the Commission, the Authority and the Member States a monitoring programme for areas where the contamination of soil and water (including sediments) by copper is a concern or may become one, in order to verify whether further limitations of use are necessary to prevent any unacceptable environmental effect. The results of that monitoring programme should also be presented.\n(9) The maximum levels for certain heavy metals, as set in row 277 of Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, were by mistake set with wrong measurement unit from those set in the respective FAO specifications. The maximum level set in the Annex to that Implementing Regulation should therefore be corrected.\n(10) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing copper compounds.\n(12) For plant protection products containing copper compounds, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing copper compounds as active substance by 6 September 2015.", "Grace period\nAny grace period granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 6 September 2016 at the latest.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0309, 24.11.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2009/37/EC of 23 April 2009 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include chlormequat, copper compounds, propaquizafop, quizalofop-P, teflubenzuron and zeta-cypermethrin as active substances (OJ L\u00a0104, 24.4.2009, p.\u00a023).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L\u00a0153, 11.6.2011, p.\u00a01).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of confirmatory data submitted for the active substance Copper (I), copper (II) variants namely copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, copper (I) oxide, Bordeaux mixture.
