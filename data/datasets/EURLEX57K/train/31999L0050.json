whereas the doubts expressed concern not only pesticides and pesticide residues, but also dangerous chemical substances, and consequently the Commission will examine the possibility of fixing, as soon as possible, maximum levels for heavy metals in foods intended for infants and young children;\n(6) Whereas, therefore, as far as foods for particular nutritional uses intended for infants and young children are concerned, it is appropriate to adopt a very low common limit for all pesticides;\n(7) Whereas this very low common limit should be fixed at 0,01 mg/kg which is in practice the minimum detectable level;\n(8) Whereas severe limitations on pesticide residues should be required; whereas, with careful selection of raw materials, and given that infant formulae and follow-on formulae undergo extensive processing during their manufacture, it is feasible to produce products containing very low levels of pesticide residues;\n(9) Whereas, however, for a small number of pesticides even such low levels might allow the possibility that under worst-case intake conditions the ADI of these pesticides is exceeded; whereas, therefore, infant formulae and follow-on formulae should be free of those particular pesticides and should be produced without the use of such pesticides;\n(10) Whereas this Directive reflects current knowledge about these substances; whereas any amendment, based on scientific or technical progress, will be decided by the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 89/398/EEC;\n(11) Whereas Directive 91/321/EEC should be amended accordingly;\n(12) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["Directive 91/321/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following point (e) is added to Article l(2):\n\"(e) 'pesticide residue' means the residue in infant formulae and follow-on formulae of a plant protection product, as defined in point 1 of Article 2 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC(11), including its metabolites and products resulting from its degradation or reaction;\n2.
