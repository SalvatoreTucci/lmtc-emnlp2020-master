The unfavourable market circumstances since the autumn of 2008 have resulted in a continuous and sharp decrease of the cheese prices on the internal market to such an extent that the current minimum free-at-frontier price is no more reflecting the threshold in respect of its objective. The cheese market and the prices are likely to stay weak and volatile for a long period, which makes the fixing of an appropriate threshold price extremely difficult. The abolition of the minimum price criterion will reduce significantly the administrative burden for traders and competent authorities. The market evolution for cheeses as well as the exports with refunds should be properly monitored in order to reveal any abuse of the minimum price requirement abolition.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to export licence applications lodged from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 August 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0234, 29.8.2006, p.\u00a04."}
