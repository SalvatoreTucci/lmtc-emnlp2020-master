On tandem axle bogies, the dampers must be positioned to minimize the oscillaton of the bogies.\n2.3.\nThe mean damping ratio D must be more than 20 % of critical damping for the suspension in its normal condition with hydraulic dampers in place and operating.\n2.4.\nThe damping ratio D of the suspension with all hydraulic dampers removed or incapacitated must be not more than 50 % of D.\n2.5.\nThe frequency of the sprung mass above the driving axle or bogie in a free transient vertical oscillation must not be higher than 2,0 Hz.\n2.6.\nThe frequency and damping of the suspension are given in paragraph 3. The test procedures for measuring the frequency and damping are laid down in paragraph 4.\n3.\nDEFINITION OF FREQUENCY AND DAMPING\nIn this definition a sprung mass M kg above a driving axle or bogie is considered. The axle or bogie has a total vertical stiffness between the road surface and the sprung mass of K Newtons/metre (N/m) and a total damping coefficient of C Newtons per  metre per second (N.s/m). The vertical displacement of the sprung mass is Z. The equation of motion for free oscillation of the sprung mass is:\nM\nd\u00b2Z\ndt\u00b2\n+ C\ndZ\ndt\n+ kZ = 0.\nThe frequency of oscillation of the sprung mass F rad/sec is:\nF =\nw\nK\nM\n-\nC\u00b2\n4M\u00b2\nThe damping is critical when C = Co,\nwhere\nCo = 2\nw\nKM\nThe damping ratio as a fraction of critical is C/Co.\nDuring free transient oscillation of the sprung mass the vertical motion of the mass will follow a damped sinusoidal path (Figure 2). The frequency can be estimated by measuring the time for as many cycles of oscillation as can be observed. The damping  can be estimated by measuring the heights of successive peaks of the oscillation in the same direction. If the peak amplitudes of the first and second cycles of the oscillaton are A1 and A2, then the damping ratio D is\nD =\nC\nCo\n=\n1\n2p\n.ln\nA1\nA2\nln being the natural logarithm of the amplitude ratio.\n4.\nTEST PROCEDURE\nTo establish by test the damping ratio D, the damping ratio with hydraulic dampers removed, and the frequency F of the suspension, the loaded vehicle should either:\n(a) be driven at low speed (5km/hr \u00b1 1 km/hr) over an 80 mm step with the profile shown in Figure 1. The transient oscillation to be analysed for frequency and damping occurs after the wheels on the driving axle have left the step; or\n(b) be pulled down by its chassis so that the driving axle load is 1,5 times its maximum static value. The vehicle hold down is suddenly released and the subsequent oscillation analysed; or\n(c) be pulled up by its chassis so that the sprung mass is lifted by 80 mm above the driving axle. The vehicle hold up is suddenly dropped and the subsequent oscillation analysed; or\n(d) be subjected to other procedures in so far as it has been proved by the manufacturer, to the satisfaction of the technical department, that they are equivalent.\nThe vehicle should be instrumented with a vertical displacement transducer between driving axle and chassis, directly above the driving axle. From the trace, the time interval between the first and second compression peaks can be measured to obtain the  frequency F and the amplitude ratio to obtain the damping. For twin drive bogies, vertical displacement transducers should be fitted between each driving axle and the chassis directly above it."}
