However, where the forward exchange rate for one or more currencies differs from the spot rate by at least a percentage to be determined, forward differential amounts shall be determined for the months following the current one and for which the aid or refund may be fixed in advance.\nIn such a case, for Member States whose currencies are in the situation referred to above and, for the months following the current one, the differential amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be adjusted to take account of the exceeding of the percentage referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n3. The differential amounts shall be fixed by the Commission. They shall be altered when the differences referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 differ by one point at least from the percentage adopted for the previous fixing of the subsidy or refund.'\n3. Article 3 shall be deleted.\n4. Article 5 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 5\n1. Where the subsidy or export refund is not fixed in advance the differential amounts shall be those valid on the day on which the application for Part ID of the Community subsidy certificate is lodged or, as the case may be, the day on which the customs export formalities are completed.\n2. Where the subsidy or export refund is fixed in advance, the differential amounts shall be those valid:\n- on the day on which the application for Part AP of the Community subsidy is lodged, where the subsidy has been fixed in advance, or\n- on the day on which the application for the advance-fixing certificate is lodged, where the export refund has been fixed in advance.\n3. However, in the event of an abnormal situation on the Community exchange market, in particular where this situation threatens to disturb the market in seeds, the Commission may decide to suspend the application of paragraph 2 for the period strictly necessary and for not more than one week.
