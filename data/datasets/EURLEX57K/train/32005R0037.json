The use of those uniform standards would ensure that the equipment used for monitoring temperatures of foodstuffs complies with a harmonised set of technical requirements.\n(4) In order to facilitate a gradual application of those measures by operators, the use of measuring instruments installed according to legislation in force before the adoption of this Regulation should be allowed during a transitional period.\n(5) Commission Directive 92/1/EEC provides for a derogation as regards transport of quick-frozen foodstuffs by rail. This derogation is no longer justified and should be terminated after a transitional period.\n(6) The imposition of temperature-recording requirements on small equipment used in retail trade would be excessive and therefore the existing derogations for retail display cabinets and small cold chambers used in retail outlets for storing stocks should be maintained.\n(7) It is advisable to ensure the direct applicability of the new standards for measuring equipment and of the technical rules already contained in Directive 92/1/EEC. In the interest of consistency and uniformity of Community legislation it is appropriate to repeal Directive 92/1/EEC and replace it by this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation concerns the monitoring of the temperature in the means of transport, warehousing and storage used for quick-frozen foodstuffs.", "Monitoring and recording of the temperature\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The means of transport, warehousing and storage of quick-frozen foodstuffs shall be fitted with suitable recording instruments to monitor, at frequent and regular intervals, the air temperature to which the quick-frozen foodstuffs are subjected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 January 2006, all measuring instruments used for the purpose of monitoring the temperature, as provided for in paragraph 1, shall comply with EN 12830, EN 13485 and EN 13486 standards.
