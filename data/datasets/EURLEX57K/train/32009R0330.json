HICPs are designed to facilitate international comparisons of consumer price inflation. They serve as important indicators for the management of monetary policy.\n(2) Under Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each Member State is required, as part of the implementation of that Regulation, to produce an HICP starting with the index for January 1997.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September 1996 on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices\u00a0(2) defines the coverage of the HICP as those goods and services which are included in household final monetary consumption expenditure incurred on the economic territory of the Member State, in one or both of the time periods being compared.\n(4) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96 of 20 November 1996 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices: transmission and dissemination of sub-indices of the HICP\u00a0(3) defines a breakdown of COICOP/HICP\u00a0(4) by division (two-digit level), group (three-digit level) and class (four-digit level).\n(5) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2454/97 of 10 December 1997 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for the quality of HICP weightings\u00a0(5) defines the \u2018weighting reference period\u2019 of an HICP as a 12-month period of consumption or expenditure. According to Article 3 thereof Member States should each month produce HICPs using weightings which reflect the consumers\u2032 expenditure pattern in the weighting reference period.\n(6) Consequently weightings at the level of COICOP/HICP divisions, groups and classes are required not to vary between months during the year. Nevertheless weightings at a more detailed level of COICOP/HICP might be allowed to reflect a seasonally varying consumption pattern. Although indices without and with seasonal weighting variability correspond to different statistical targets, restrictions on the methodology may ensure the necessary comparability between those two approaches, as well as comparability between Member States within the approaches.\n(7) Seasonal products are typically not available or their purchased volumes are negligible for certain periods in an annual cyclical pattern and according to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 where target samples do not require monthly observation of actual prices throughout the year estimated prices should be used instead.\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1921/2001 of 28 September 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for revisions of the harmonised index of consumer prices and amending Regulation (EC) No 2602/2000\u00a0(6) sets the framework for revisions in the HICPs.\n(9) Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 provides that HICPs which differ on account of differences in concepts, methods or practices used in their definition and compilation should not be considered comparable. However, the methodologies applied in the Member States for seasonal products differ substantially and the results may not be sufficiently comparable. Therefore a harmonised approach with respect to seasonal products in the HICPs is necessary in order to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the requirements as to comparability, reliability, and relevance under the third paragraph of Article 4 and under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.\n(10) The European Central Bank has been consulted in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95\u00a0(7).\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(8),", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes minimum standards for the treatment of seasonal products in order to improve the comparability, reliability and relevance of the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs).", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018seasonal products\u2019 means those goods and services that are not available for purchase, or purchased in small or negligible volumes, for certain periods in a typical annual cyclical pattern. The in-season period is meant to cover at least one month;\n2. \u2018subdivision of COICOP/HICP\u2019 means COICOP/HICP class in the case of goods and services in a COICOP/HICP class, and COICOP/HICP group for groups that are not subdivided into classes according to the harmonised COICOP/HICP classification as laid down in Regulation 1749/1999 of 23 July 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 2214/96, concerning the subindices of the harmonised indices of consumer prices\u00a0(9);\n3. \u2018counter-seasonal estimation\u2019 means the estimation of a price for a product-offer of a product that is out-of-season so that:\n\u2014 in the first month of the out-of-season period, the estimated price is equal to a typical price observed in the previous in-season period, and,\n\u2014 from the second month, the estimated price is equal to the estimated price for the preceding month, adjusted by the change in observed prices on average over all seasonal products that are in-season in the same subdivision of COICOP/HICP,\n4. \u2018all-seasonal estimation\u2019 means the estimation of a price for a product-offer of a product that is out-of-season so that:\n\u2014 in the first month of the out-of-season period, the estimated price is equal to a typical price observed in the previous in-season period, and,\n\u2014 from the second month, the estimated price is equal to the estimated price for the preceding month, adjusted by the change in observed prices on average over all available products in the same subdivision of COICOP/HICP,\n5. \u2018strict annual weights index\u2019 means a price index using weightings that do not differ between months within the same year at all levels of index calculation;\n6. \u2018class-confined seasonal weights index\u2019 means a price index using weightings that within the same year:\n\u2014 do not differ between months for any COICOP/HICP subdivision taken as a whole,\n\u2014 do not differ between months for products within any COICOP/HICP subdivision that does not contain any seasonal product,\n\u2014 within the in-season period do not differ between months for products within any COICOP/HICP subdivision that contains seasonal products, except to the extent that it is necessary to allow for month-on-month changes in the composition of the basket,", "Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The minimum standards shall apply to seasonal products within the following COICOP/HICP classes and groups:\n01.1.3 Fish\n01.1.6 Fruit\n01.1.7 Vegetables\n03,1 Clothing\n03,2 Footwear\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where appropriate, the minimum standards shall serve as guidance also concerning seasonal products within COICOP/HICP classes and groups other than those listed in the first paragraph.", "Minimum standards\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any given month, seasonal products shall be deemed to be either in-season or out-of-season.

Where counter-seasonal estimation is not deemed feasible, all-seasonal estimation shall be used.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For an HICP that is a class-confined seasonal weights index, a seasonal product that is out-of-season shall have a weight of zero.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For an HICP that is a strict annual weights index, estimations may also be performed at a more detailed level than the subdivision of COICOP/HICP, such as for strata if a stratified sample is being used. For an HICP that is a class confined seasonal weights index, seasonal weights may also be established at a more detailed level.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changes in prices of seasonal products for which the share of the total consumption expenditure, covered by the HICP, during a typical in-season period is likely to be at least two parts per thousand shall be reflected in the HICP.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weights for seasonal products shall be compiled and updated as necessary in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2454/97.
