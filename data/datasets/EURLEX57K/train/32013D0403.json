This will have a significant impact on the number of tests to be performed under their programmes for the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), and for the eradication of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and of scrapie approved for the year 2013 and significantly reduce the related funding needs.\n(5) Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, France, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have submitted to the Commission for approval amended programmes for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in relation to that amendment to Decision 2009/719/EC.\n(6) In addition, Hungary has submitted an amended programme for the eradication and monitoring of bluetongue modifying its activities in relation to the implementation of entomological surveillance.\n(7) Following the detection of the Bluetongue virus serotype 1 circulating in certain areas of its territory, Spain has submitted an amended programme for the eradication and monitoring of bluetongue to include compulsory vaccination in those areas in order to control that disease and prevent its spread.\n(8) Greece has submitted an amended programme for the eradication of rabies to define the areas where oral vaccination will be applied, following the discovery of rabies cases in its territory.\n(9) Following the recent conclusion of bilateral negotiations with Belarus on rabies cooperation, Poland has submitted an amended programme for the eradication control and monitoring of rabies to include oral vaccination activities in certain bordering areas in the territory of that third country, in order to protect the Union from the reintroduction of rabies through the movement of infected wild animals across the common borders.\n(10) The Commission has assessed those amended programmes from both a veterinary and a financial point of view. They were found to comply with relevant Union veterinary legislation and in particular with the criteria set out in Decision 2008/341/EC. The amended programmes should therefore be approved.\n(11) The approval by this Decision of the amended programmes has an impact on the amounts needed for carrying out the eradication, control and monitoring programmes approved by Implementing Decision 2012/761/EU. The maximum amount of the Union financial contribution for certain of those programmes should therefore be adjusted accordingly.\n(12) Implementing Decision 2012/761/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The amended programmes for monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), and for the eradication of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and of scrapie submitted by the following Member States on the following dates are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013:\n(a) Belgium on 5 April 2013;\n(b) Czech Republic on 5 April 2013;\n(c) Denmark on 24 April 2013;\n(d) Germany on 20 March 2013;\n(e) Estonia on 26 March 2013;\n(f) Ireland on 22 March 2013;\n(g) Spain on 27 March 2013;\n(h) France on 29 March 2013;\n(i) Cyprus on 29 March 2013;\n(j) Latvia on 28 March 2013;\n(k) Luxembourg on 3 April 2013;\n(l) Hungary on 27 March 2013;\n(m) Austria on 27 March 2013;\n(n) Slovenia on 20 March 2013;\n(o) Slovakia on 26 March 2013;\n(p) Finland on 28 March 2013;\n(q) Sweden on 22 March 2013;\n(r) United Kingdom on 7 June 2013.", "The amended programmes for the eradication and monitoring of bluetongue in endemic and high risk areas submitted by the following Member States on the following dates are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013.\n(a) Spain on 26 March 2013;\n(b) Hungary on 24 January 2013.", "The amended programmes for the eradication of rabies submitted by the following Member States on the following dates are hereby approved for the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013:\n(a) Poland on 28 March 2013;\n(b) Greece on 28 June 2013.", "Implementing Decision 2012/761/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 4(2), point (b)(vii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(vii) EUR 500\u00a0000 for Spain;\u2019\n(2) in Article 10(2), point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) shall not exceed the following:\n(i) EUR\u00a0290\u00a0000 for Belgium;\n(ii) EUR\u00a0270\u00a0000 for Bulgaria;\n(iii) EUR\u00a0500\u00a0000 for the Czech Republic;\n(iv) EUR\u00a0300\u00a0000 for Denmark;\n(v) EUR\u00a04\u00a0700\u00a0000 for Germany;\n(vi) EUR\u00a060\u00a0000 for Estonia;\n(vii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0210\u00a0000 for Ireland;\n(viii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0700\u00a0000 for Greece;\n(ix) EUR\u00a03\u00a0290\u00a0000 for Spain;\n(x) EUR\u00a012\u00a0600\u00a0000 for France;\n(xi) EUR\u00a04\u00a0800\u00a0000 for Italy;\n(xii) EUR\u00a0230\u00a0000 for Croatia;\n(xiii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0900\u00a0000 for Cyprus;\n(xiv) EUR\u00a080\u00a0000 for Latvia;\n(xv) EUR\u00a0420\u00a0000 for Lithuania;\n(xvi) EUR\u00a050\u00a0000 for Luxembourg;\n(xvii) EUR\u00a0790\u00a0000 for Hungary;\n(xviii) EUR\u00a025\u00a0000 for Malta;\n(xix) EUR\u00a02\u00a0200\u00a0000 for the Netherlands;\n(xx) EUR\u00a0500\u00a0000 for Austria;\n(xxi) EUR\u00a02\u00a0600\u00a0000 for Poland;\n(xxii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0100\u00a0000 for Portugal;\n(xxiii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0200\u00a0000 for Romania;\n(xxiv) EUR\u00a0160\u00a0000 for Slovenia;\n(xxv) EUR\u00a0250\u00a0000 for Slovakia;\n(xxvi) EUR\u00a0160\u00a0000 for Finland;\n(xxvii) EUR\u00a0210\u00a0000 for Sweden;\n(xxviii) EUR\u00a02\u00a0520\u00a0000 for the United Kingdom.\u2019\n(3) Article 11 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 2, point (d)(ii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(ii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0500\u00a0000 for Greece;\u2019\n(b) in paragraph 2, point (d)(vii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(vii) EUR\u00a06\u00a0850\u00a0000 for Poland;\u2019\n(c) in paragraph 4, point (c), is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) not exceed:\n(i) EUR\u00a01\u00a0260\u00a0000 for the part of the Lithuanian programme implemented in Belarus;\n(ii) EUR\u00a01\u00a0255\u00a0000 for the part of the Polish programme implemented in Ukraine;\n(iii) EUR\u00a0295\u00a0000 for the part of the Polish programme implemented in Belarus.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 29.4.2008, p. 44.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 8.12.2012, p. 83.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 29.9.2009, p. 35.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 35, 6.2.2013, p. 6."}
