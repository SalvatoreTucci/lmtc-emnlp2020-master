In Article 1 (2) point vii, 'lards and reduced fats' is replaced by 'rendered fats'.\n2. In Article 2 (2), subparagraph beginning Chapter VII (continuous/atmospheric/defatted) 'the above should be preceded by coagulation at > 80 \u00c2\u00b0C for 30 to 60 minutes' is deleted.\n3. In Article 2 the following paragraph 6 is added:\n'6. Batch systems which achieve the parameters laid down in paragraph 2 for continuous systems operating in accordance with Chapters III, IV, VI or VII may also be authorized.'", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 1995.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 363, 27. 12. 1990, p. 51.\n(2) OJ No L 62, 15. 3. 1993, p. 49.\n(3) OJ No L 359, 9. 12. 1992, p. 23.\n(4) OJ No L 172, 7. 7. 1994, p. 25."}
