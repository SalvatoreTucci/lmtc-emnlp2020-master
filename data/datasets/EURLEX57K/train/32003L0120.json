The use of this conversion factor for the declared energy content of a product would misrepresent its reduced energy content achieved by the use of salatrims in its manufacture and would thus result in a failure to fully inform the consumer. Therefore it is necessary to adopt the appropriate conversion factor for salatrims to be used for the calculation of the declared energy value of foodstuffs.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The following is added at the end of Article 5(1) of Directive 90/496/EEC:\n\">TABLE>\"", "1.
