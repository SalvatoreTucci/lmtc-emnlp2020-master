whereas 'interim` Additional Protocols will cover solely the trade-related aspects of the Additional Protocols; whereas, because of the excessively tight deadlines, however, the interim Additional Protocols cannot enter into force on 1 January 1996; whereas it is therefore advisable to provide for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements; whereas the adjustment should apply from 1 January to 30 June 1996;\nWhereas, in order to ensure that the quantities available are allocated fairly, account should be taken, firstly, of the quantities awarded already during the first quarter of 1996 and the new quantities and, secondly, of Council Decision 94/391/EC on the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and Bulgaria (8) and Council Decision 94/392/EC on the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and Romania (9);\nWhereas import licences for the quantities available for the period 1 January to 31 March 1996 have been issued on the basis of Regulations (EEC) No 2698/93 and (EC) No 1590/94; whereas the quantities available for the period 1 April to 30 June 1996 should be fixed taking into consideration the quantities awarded and the quotas set for that period; whereas, in order to ensure a smooth switch-over to the new arrangements and in particular that the quantities imported from 1 January 1996 within the framework of the Regulations mentioned above qualify for the reduction in customs duties to 20 %, provision should be made for the reimbursement of amounts paid in excess;\nWhereas new tariff quotas with fixed customs duties, falling within CN codes 1501 00 19 and 1601 00 91, have been granted under Regulation (EC) No 3066/95;
