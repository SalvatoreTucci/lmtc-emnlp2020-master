Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Diclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, was authorised for 10 years in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens reared for laying by Commission Regulation (EC) No 162/2003\u00a0(3). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of diclazuril, as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 31 January 2013\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, diclazuril does not have an adverse effect on animal, human health or the environment and it is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens reared for laying. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of diclazuril, CAS number 101831-37-2, shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulation (EC) No 162/2003 should be repealed.\n(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019 is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Regulation (EC) No 162/2003 is repealed.", "The preparation specified in the Annex and feed containing that preparation, which are produced and labelled before 2 February 2014 in accordance with the rules applicable before 2 August 2013 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 26, 31.1.2003, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(3):3106.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition\nDiclazuril: 0,50\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nProtein-poor soybean meal: 99,25\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nPolyvidone K 30: 0,20\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nSodium hydroxide: 0,05\u00a0g/100\u00a0g\nCharacterisation of the active substance\nDiclazuril, C17H9Cl3N4O2, (\u00b1)-4-chlorophenyl[2,6-dichloro-4- (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-triazin-2-yl)phenyl]acetonitrile,\nCAS number: 101831-37-2\nRelated impurities:\nDegradation compound (R064318): \u2264 0,1\u00a0%\nOther related impurities (T001434, R066891, R068610, R070156, R070016): \u2264 0,5\u00a0% individually\nTotal impurities: \u2264 1,5\u00a0%\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1)\nFor determination of diclazuril in feed: reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Ultraviolet detection at 280\u00a0nm (Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009\u00a0(2)).\nFor determination of diclazuril in poultry tissues: HPLC coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) using one precursor ion and two diagnostic product ions.\n1.
