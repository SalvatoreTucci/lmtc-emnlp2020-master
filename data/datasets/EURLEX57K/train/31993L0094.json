DIMENSIONS\nThe dimensions of the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles(1)  are as follows:\n1.1. Mopeds and light quadricycles\n1.1.1. Width: 100 mm;\n1.1.2. Height: 175 mm;\nor\n1.1.3. Width: 145 mm;\n1.1.4. Height: 125 mm.\n1.2. Motorcycles, tricycles up to a maximum power of 15 kW and quadricycles other than light quadricycles:\n1.2.1. Width: 280 mm;\n1.2.2. Height: 210 mm.\n1.3. Tricycles with a maximum power exceeding 15 kW:\n1.3.1. The provisions for passenger cars as set out in Directive 70/222/EEC shall apply.\n2. GENERAL LOCATION\n2.1. The mounting for the rear registration plate of a motorcycle, motorcycle combination or tricycle must be located at the rear of the vehicle in such a manner that:\n2.1.1. the plate can be positioned within the longitudinal planes passing through the outer extremities of the vehicle.\n3. INCLINATION\n3.1. The rear registration plate:\n3.1.1. must be at right angles to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle;\n3.1.2. may be inclined from the vertical by not more 30\u00c2\u00b0 when the backing plate for the registration number faces upwards;\n3.1.3. may be inclined by not more than 15\u00c2\u00b0 from the vertical when the backing plate for the registration number faces downwards;\n4. MAXIMUM HEIGHT\n4.1. No point on the space for mounting the registration plate may be more than 1,5 m above the ground when the vehicle is laden (kerb mass plus a mass of 75 kg).\n5. MINIMUM HEIGHT\n5.1. No point on the space for mounting the registration plate shall be less than 0,20 m above the ground, or less than the radius of the wheel above the ground if that is less than 0,20 m, when the vehicle is laden (kerb mass plus a mass of 75 kg).\n6. GEOMETRIC VISIBILITY\n6.1. The space for mounting the plate must be visible within a space bordered by two dihedrals: one with a horizontal edge defined by two planes passing through the upper and lower horizontal edges of the space for mounting the plate, the angles of  which in relation to the horizontal are shown in Figure 1; the other with a perceptibly vertical edge defined by two planes passing through each side of the plate, the angles of which in relation to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle are shown  in Figure 2.\nFigure 1\nAngle of geometric visibility (dihedral with horizontal edge)\nFigure 2\nAngle of geometric visibilty (dihedral with perceptibly vertical edge)\nAppendix 1  Information document in respect of the space for mounting the rear registration plate of a type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle\n(to be attached to the application for component type-approval where this is submitted separately from the application for vehicle type-approval\nOrder No (assigned by the applicant):  .\nThe application for component type-approval in respect of the space for mounting the rear registration plate of a type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle must contain the information set out in Annex II to Council Directive 92/61/EEC:\n- Part A, in sections:\n- 0.1,\n- 0.2,\n- 0.4 to 0.6,\n- 2.2,\n- 2.1.1,\n- Part B, in sections 1.2, 1.2.1. and,\n- Part C, in sections 2.11 and 2.11.1.\nAppendix 2  Name of administration\nComponent type-approval certificate in respect of the space for mounting the rear registration plate of a type of two or three-wheel motor vehicle\nMODEL\nReport No . by technical service . date .\nComponent type-approval No  .Extension No .\n1.
