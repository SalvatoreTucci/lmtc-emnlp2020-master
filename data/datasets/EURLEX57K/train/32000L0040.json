This list includes UN/ECE Regulation No 93(5).\n(3) In order to reduce the number of European road accident casualties, it is necessary to introduce without delay the measures established by UNE/ECE Regulation No 93 into the EC type-approval procedure set up by Council Directive 70/156/EEC(6), so as to improve the protection of the occupants of passenger cars and light vans from injury in the event of a collision with the front of heavy goods vehicles and to allow manufacturers of such devices and of vehicles equipped with such devices to obtain an EC type-approval if they meet the technical requirements of that Regulation.\n(4) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States on account of the scale and effect of the action proposed in the relevant sector, and can therefore be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary for the attainment of its objective, namely EC type-approval.\n(5) This Directive is one of the separate directives which must be complied with in order to conform to the EC type-approval procedure. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicles, vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.\n(6) In view of the considerable number of road accidents involving commercial vehicles having a mass of more than 3,5 tonnes, and consequently in order to increase road safety, the provisions concerning such vehicles should be made mandatory by this Directive without awaiting any further supplements to EC type-approval for this category of vehicles.\n(7) Directive 70/156/EEC should be amended in consequence,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) \"vehicle\" means any motor vehicle as defined in Section A of Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC;\n(b) \"front underrun protective device\" means a front underrun protective device which is intended to be part of a vehicle and which can be approved as a separate technical unit in accordance with Article 2 of Directive 70/156/EEC.", "1.
