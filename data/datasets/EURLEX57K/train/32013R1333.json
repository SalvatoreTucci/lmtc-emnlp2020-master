Those rules cover in particular the obligation for the Member States to use the information systems made available by the Commission and the validation of the access rights of the authorities or individuals authorised to send notifications. Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 also sets common principles applying to the information systems so that they guarantee the authenticity, integrity and legibility over time of the documents and provides for personal data protection. The obligation to use those information systems has to be provided for in each Regulation establishing a specific notification obligation.\n(2) The Commission has developed an information system that allows managing documents and procedures electronically in its own internal working procedures and in its relations with the authorities involved in the common agricultural policy.\n(3) Several communication and notification obligations can be fulfilled via that system, in particular those provided for in Commission Regulations (EC) No 1709/2003\u00a0(3), (EC) No 1345/2005\u00a0(4), (EC) No 972/2006\u00a0(5), (EC) No 341/2007\u00a0(6), (EC) No 1454/2007\u00a0(7), (EC) No 826/2008\u00a0(8), (EC) No 1296/2008\u00a0(9), (EC) No 1130/2009\u00a0(10), (EU) No 1272/2009\u00a0(11) and (EU) No 479/2010\u00a0(12).\n(4) In the interest of efficient administration and taking into account the experience acquired, some communications and notifications should be simplified or specified.\n(5) In order to enhance the monitoring of the market situation in the olive oil sector and considering the experience gained in the field, it is necessary to clarify some notification obligations of the Member States listed in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 826/2008. For this purpose, the frequency of the provision of an estimate of the production and consumption of olive oil as well as ending stocks shall be increased but the obligation to notify shall be limited to Member States producing olive oil. The amendment should be applicable from 1 January 2014 since that is the expected date of application of the new common organisation of the markets.\n(6) Regulations (EC) No 1709/2003, (EC) No
