At present, Uruguay is not included in that Decision.\n(3) Following a Commission mission in October 2004, subsequent follow-up and guarantees provided by Uruguay, the animal and public health situation is now satisfactory so as to allow that country to be included on the list of approved third countries set out in Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC.\n(4) In view of Uruguay\u2019s animal health status as regards Newcastle disease, it is appropriate that imports of fresh meat of farmed ratites from Uruguay are accompanied by the model health attestation \u2018A\u2019 as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC.\n(5) Decision 2000/609/EC, as amended by Decision 2004/118/EC, provides erroneously that fresh meat of farmed ratites from Australia must be accompanied by the model health attestation \u2018A\u2019 as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC, instead of the model health attestation \u2018B\u2019 laid down in that Annex. That mistake should therefore be corrected.\n(6) Decision 2000/609/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC shall be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 November 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 35.
