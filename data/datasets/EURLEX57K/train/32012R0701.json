Pursuant to Article 103c of that Regulation, operational programmes in the fruit and vegetables sector may include crisis prevention and management measures, aimed at avoiding and dealing with crises on the fruit and vegetable markets.\n(2) In accordance with Article 79(1) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011\u00a0(2), Annex XI to that Implementing Regulation sets out the maximum amounts of support for market withdrawals for the products listed therein. Those amounts should be fixed so as to avoid that withdrawals become a permanent alternative outlet for products compared to placing them on the market and to ensure, at the same time, that withdrawals remain an effective instrument for crisis prevention and management.\n(3) In order to ensure that withdrawals remain an effective instrument for crisis prevention and management, the maximum amounts of support for market withdrawals should be increased for those fruit and vegetables where current support levels are particularly low compared to the average producer prices in the Union. This is the case for tomatoes, grapes, apricots, pears, aubergines and melons. In addition, in order to avoid overcompensation of withdrawals of lower-priced tomatoes intended for processing, a differentiated amount should be introduced for tomatoes produced from 1 June to 31 October, which is the period in which tomatoes intended for processing may be withdrawn.\n(4) In order to encourage the free distribution of withdrawn fruit and vegetables within the meaning of Article 103d(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and any other equivalent destinations approved by the Member States, a higher maximum amount of aid should be fixed than for other destinations, if the difference between the average producer price in the Union and the current maximum support levels allows this without creating an alternative outlet for the products compared to placing them on the market. This is the case for cauliflowers, tomatoes, apples, grapes, apricots, pears, aubergines, melons, watermelons, clementines and lemons.\n(5) In order to facilitiate the distribution of withdrawn products by charitable organisations and institutions, those organisations and institutions should only be obliged to keep financial accounts for the operation in question if they have requested and obtained the authorisation from the competent authorities of the Member State to ask a symbolic financial contribution from the final recipients. The possibility to request such a contribution should also be extended to fresh products.\n(6) In order to take past experiences in applying crisis prevention and management measures into account, it is appropriate to clarify the definitions of green harvesting and non-harvesting and the situations in which green harvesting and non-harvesting measures may be undertaken. In addition, so as to align the various crisis prevention and management measures and to increase their effectiveness, it is appropriate to delete the specific obligation provided for in Article 85(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 to include a compulsory market analysis in the first notification of each intended green harvesting operation.\n(7) In order to react to a sudden crisis situation, green harvesting and non-harvesting should be possible for fruit and vegetables with a longer harvesting period, although the normal harvest has already begun or commercial production has already been taken from the area in question, subject to restrictions to be decided by Member States. In such cases, only the production to be harvested in the six weeks following the operation should be compensated. As plants bearing fruit and vegetables with a longer harvesting period often bear both ripe and unripe products at the same time, it is appropriate to derogate from the general rule opposing the application of green harvesting and non-harvesting measures for the same product and the same given area in any given year.\n(8) In order to ensure that the obligation to demonstrate that each lot was disposed of in accordance with the relevant conditions is fulfilled and to allow for effective customs controls based on risk analysis, detailed rules should be set out as regards the obligation to make available to the customs authorities certain documents relevant for the controls to be undertaken.\n(9) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) It is appropriate to apply the new amounts of support for market withdrawals retroactively as from 1 July 2012 when the summer marketing season starts. In order to give time to importers to adapt to the new rules concerning the entry price system, those rules should apply from 1 September 2012.\n(11) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 80(2), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n(2) In Article 83(1), point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) keep separate stock records for the operations in question;\u2019\n(3) In Article 84(1), points (a) and (b) are replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) \u201cgreen harvesting\u201d means the total harvesting of unripe non-marketable products on a given area.
