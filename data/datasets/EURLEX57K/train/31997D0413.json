whereas the main parameters for expressing effort in respect of passive gear are different; whereas it is nonetheless necessary to ensure a non-discriminatory approach and fully equivalent result as between the two gear types;\nWhereas Member States should be able to choose to reduce fishing mortality by the different means available to them, either by reducing capacity for each fleet segment, or by reducing fishing effort for each fishery; whereas to this effect a certain period must be allowed for Member States to develop management programmes setting out the implementation of these means in order to achieve the objectives fixed;\nWhereas the required reductions in fishing effort can be achieved through fishing effort limitation programmes or reductions in capacity; whereas specific fishing effort limitation programmes on depletion risk and overfished stocks are to be encouraged where a Member State demonstrates its ability to set up and administer such programmes; whereas in the absence of fishing effort limitation programmes, or if these programmes do not offer the necessary guarantees or do not have sufficient effect, the only alternative is capacity reduction;\nWhereas the fleet objectives for Member States set by this Decision should be based on the previous objectives;\nWhereas the fleet segments of Member States involved in bilateral fisheries agreements, or in fishing activities covered by international fishing conventions to which the Community is a Contracting Party, need to be adjusted in accordance with the resources available and accessible under those agreements or conventions;\nWhereas this Decision is based on a five-year period in order to ensure real progress over a sufficient length of time; whereas the measures proposed must aim to eliminate the factors that made this restructuring necessary, in particular by putting into place a permanent regime of fleet renewal;\nWhereas a review of the fishing effort reduction objectives should be carried out by the Council by the end of 1999 on the basis of the latest scientific advice available and an assessment made at the same time of the effects of all available measures on the state of resources and the sector to be provided by the Commission to the Council;\nWhereas it is necessary to verify that the programmes of Member States are progressively achieved by reference to intermediate objectives;\nWhereas full transparency is required among Member States; whereas this transparency should be ensured in the decision process leading to the adoption of the individual programmes for Member States, and their subsequent implementation, through the procedures provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (ECC) 3760/92,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision the following definitions are used:\n1. the capacities of fleet segments are expressed at least in GT tonnage and kW power as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels (4);\n2. the effort of fleet segments comprised of vessels using active gear is defined in accordance with Annex VI of Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/94 of 19 January 1994 concerning the fishing vessel register of the Community (5);\n3. the effort of fleet segments comprised of vessels using passive gear is expressed in terms of the capacity of the vessels defined in subparagraph 1;\n4. without prejudice to Article 4 (1), a fleet segment is defined as a group of vessels having homogeneous physical characteristics using the same fishing gear or the same type of fishing gear;\n5. a fishery is defined as a fishing activity on a stock or a group of stocks harvested by the same fishing gear or the same type of fishing gear.", "1. By 31 December 2001 at the latest, the fishing effort of each Member State shall be reduced, taking the levels defined in Article 7 (1) as a starting point, on the basis of the reduction rates in fishing effort which are required to be achieved in relation to the critical stocks set out in Annex I.\n2. The pilot reduction rates shall be as follows:\n- 30 % for the stocks defined as depletion risk in Annex I;\n- 20 % for the stocks defined as overfished in Annex I.\n3. In the case of stocks defined as fully exploited in Annex I, there shall be no increase in fishing effort for the period 1997 to 2001.\n4. In respect of stocks other than those referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, including stocks for which the situation is insufficiently known, there shall be no increase in fishing effort for the period 1997 to 2001. In specific cases where Member States can identify additional fishing opportunities on these stocks, a level of additional fishing effort for the fleet segments fishing these stocks may be decided.\n5. The weighted fishing effort reduction rates are calculated by fleet segment or by fishery as a function of the composition of the catches of stocks in these fleet segments or fisheries in accordance with Annex II.", "A Member State may exempt fishing vessels of its fleet of less than 12 metres overall, other than trawlers, from the provisions of Article 2. In this case, the aggregate capacity of this fleet segment, expressed in GT tonnage and in kW power, shall not increase beyond the level at 1 January 1997, or beyond the level corresponding to the objectives of MAGP III, for the period to 31 December 2001, except in the framework of programmes for improving safety of navigation at sea.", "1. The segmentation of the fleet of each Member State shall be determined in relation to the stocks defined in Annex I and to the fishing techniques, taking account of the segmentation adopted as part of MAGP III as well as the differing situations in Member States.\n2. In the Multiannual Guidance Programmes for Member States, increases in capacity resulting exclusively from safety improvements shall justify, on a cases by case basis, an increase by the same amount of the objectives for fleet segments where they do not increase the fishing effort of the vessels concerned.", "Reduction in fishing mortality of critical stocks shall be achieved for each fleet segment by a reduction in capacity or for each fishery by means of a reduction in fishing effort.", "1. Each Member State shall submit to the Commission by 30 June 1997 a fishing effort limitation programme. This programme shall establish, by fleet segment, the starting levels for capacity and fishing effort on the basis of the objectives fixed in the MAGP III, whilst taking account of the fishing effort data submitted in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) No 109/94.\nIn cases where the objectives are achieved by capacity reduction only, the Member State shall apply to the fleet segment the weighted reduction rates calculated in accordance with Annex II.\nIn cases where the objectives are achieved by fishing effort reductions, the Member State shall identify the fisheries related to each fleet segment and shall allocate to these fisheries starting levels for a fishing effort within the limits of the starting levels laid down for each fleet segment, with a view to ensuring that Member States can take up the quotas actually available to them. The Member State shall apply to the fishing effort levels defined above by fishery the reduction rates defined in Article 2.\nThe Member State shall identify and quantify the means (capacity, activity) by which to respect the aforementioned objectives.\n2. Among the means to reduce fishing effort, each Member State shall determine in its programme the reduction in the capacity of each fleet segment which will permit the objectives to be achieved. This reduction in capacity shall be ensured by the establishment in each Member State of a permanent regime to control the renewal of the fleet. This regime shall determine, segment by segment, the ratio of entries/exits of vessels that will ensure over the period that the fishing capacity by type of vessel will be brought down to the determined levels.\n3. Where a Member State does not submit such programmes or these are not approved, fishing effort reduction targets shall be achieved through reductions in capacity.\n4. Where a Member State does not achieve the annual intermediate objectives referred to in Article 9 (1), the objectives of the following year shall be adjusted accordingly, including through reductions in capacity.", "1. The starting point for Member States' fleet objectives for 31 December 2001 shall be the fleet objectives fixed by the previous programmes for 31 December 1996.\n2. In fixing the objectives for the fishing fleets of each Member State under this Decision, account shall be taken of the specific characteristics of individual fishing fleets.", "The fleet segment fishing in the waters of third countries or on the high seas shall be identified and the fishing effort adjusted by the Commission and the Member State taking account of the global fishing opportunities of this fleet segment in line with the objectives fixed in fisheries management recommendations issued by international organizations, approved by the Community or the Member States, and, where appropriate, the fishing opportunities in third country waters defined by agreements concluded between the Community and those third countries.", "1. The implementation of the objectives and detailed rules of this Decision shall be carried out by the Commission for the period 1997 to 2001 in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 (6).
