There is, therefore, a need to produce quarterly accounts by institutional sector, for the European Union as a whole and for the euro area.\n(4) Production of these accounts is part of the overall aim to compile a system of annual and quarterly accounts for the European Union and for the euro area. The system includes the main macroeconomic aggregates and the financial and non-financial accounts by institutional sector. The aim is to achieve consistency across all these accounts and, with regard to the rest of the world accounts, between the balance of payments and the national accounts data.\n(5) The compilation of European accounts by institutional sector, in accordance with the principles of the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a02223/96\u00a0(3), requires the transmission by Member States of quarterly national accounts by institutional sector. However, the European accounts must reflect the economy of the European area as a whole and may differ from the simple aggregation of Member States\u2019 accounts. In particular, the objective is to take account of the transactions of the institutions and bodies of the European Union in the accounts of the area concerned (the European Union or the euro-zone, whichever is applicable).\n(6) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0322/97 of 17\u00a0February 1997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(4).\n(7) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector for the European Union and the euro area, cannot be achieved satisfactorily by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. In particular, where Member States make a negligible contribution to the European totals, they should not be required to report the full detail of data.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5).\n(9) The Statistical Programme Committee set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(6) and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC\u00a0(7) have been consulted,", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThis Regulation provides a common framework for the contributions of the Member States to the compilation of quarterly European non-financial accounts by institutional sector.", "Transmission of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall transmit to the Commission quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector, as specified in the Annex, except, in the first instance, items P.1, P.2, D.42, D.43, D.44, D.45 and B.4G.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A timetable for the transmission of items P.1, P.2, D.42, D.43, D.44, D.45, and B.4G, respectively, and any decision to require a breakdown of the transactions listed in the Annex by counterpart sector shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a08(2).
