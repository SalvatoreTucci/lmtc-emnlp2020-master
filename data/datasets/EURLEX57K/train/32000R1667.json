This mechanism seeks to take account, to some extent, of storage costs and financing charges for storing cereals in the Community and of the need to ensure that stocks are disposed of in line with market requirements. In accordance with the approach followed for the reform of the common organisation of the markets in connection with Agenda 2000 and in order to enable producers to organise their production over several years, the monthly increases should be fixed without any limit in time, without prejudice to any revisions that may be called for in the future. In particular given the stability of prices and interest rates, the increases currently applicable should be maintained.\n(2) In the context of providing support for producers of rice, Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 lays down a national base area for each producer Member State with the exception of France and Greece, for which two base areas are laid down. Greece has requested that the departments of Kavala and Aitolia and Akarnania be included in the same base area as Thessaloniki, Serres and Fthiotida, as rice constitutes a traditional crop in all of these departments. The total area of the base areas and the amount of the compensatory payment remain unchanged.\n(3) With an eye to simplification and legislative clarity, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3072/95 that are not relevant should be deleted at the same time.\n(4) The measures necessary for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 is amended as follows:\n1.
