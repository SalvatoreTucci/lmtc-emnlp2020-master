In accordance with footnotes accompanying the relevant catch limits in that Annex, the Commission may establish the conditions under which the quotas for the experimental fishery relating to sand eel abundance may be fished.\n(2) Pursuant to point 1 of Annex IID to Regulation (EC) No 41/2007, the conditions laid down in that Annex IID shall apply to Community vessels fishing in ICES zones IIIa and IV and in EC waters of ICES zone IIa with demersal trawl, seine or similar towed gears with a mesh size of less than 16 mm. Unless otherwise specified, or as a consequence of consultations or agreements between the Community and Norway, those conditions are also applicable to third country vessels authorised to fish for sand eel in EC waters of ICES zone IV.\n(3) Sand eel is a North Sea stock which is shared with Norway but which is currently not jointly managed. Pursuant to consultations between the Community and Norway on 30 March 2007 an agreement has been reached on conditions for the experimental fishery for sand eel in the North Sea. That agreement should be implemented into Community law.\n(4) With a view to fixing the fishing opportunities for sand eel as early as possible pursuant to point 8 of Annex IID to Regulation (EC) No 41/2007 the experimental fishery is carried out during April and the first half of May.
