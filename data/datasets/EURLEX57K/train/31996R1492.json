For aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, dinoseb and dinoseb salts, fluoroacetamide, HCH, chlordane, chlordimeform, cyhexatin, EDB, heptachlor, mercury compounds, reported control actions refer to pesticide use (as defined by the FAO/UNEP). For crocidolite, PBBs, PCBs, PCTs and tris(2,3 dibromopropyl)phosphate, reported control actions refer to industrial use. Decision guidance documents (DGDs) have been prepared by UNEP/FAO (IRPTC) to help countries to make import decisions concerning those chemicals. Nevertheless, DGD is not the only information taken into account by countries when they take their import decision. Therefore, the import decision does not necessarily refer to the uses mentioned in the DGD.\n>TABLE>\n2.
