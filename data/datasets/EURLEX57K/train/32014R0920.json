Since heading 1604 of the Combined Nomenclature, covering prepared or preserved fish, makes already reference to \u2018fillets known as loins\u2019 such a reference should also be introduced in Chapter 3 of the Combined Nomenclature, covering fish.\n(4) Taking into account the anatomy of big fish such as tuna (of the genus Thunnus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), marlin, sailfish and spearfish (of the family Istiophoridae), as well as oceanic sharks (Hexanchus griseus; Cetorhinus maximus; family Alopiidae; Rhincodon typus; family Carcharhinidae; family Sphyrnidae; family Isuridae), a maximum of four relatively large fish fillets per fish can be obtained (from the right and left side as well as from the upper and lower side).\n(5) In order to ensure a consistent application of the Combined Nomenclature, the classification of fish fillets referred to as \u2018loins\u2019 (whether or not cut into pieces) obtained from big fish, under heading 0304, should be clarified.\n(6) An Additional Note should therefore be inserted in Chapter 3 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature to ensure its uniform interpretation throughout the Union.\n(7) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 3 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 the following Additional note 2 is added:\n\u20182.
