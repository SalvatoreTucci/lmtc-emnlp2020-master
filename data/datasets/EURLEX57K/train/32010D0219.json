In addition, Indonesia has now provided the Commission with the appropriate guarantees. It is therefore no longer necessary to test each consignment of fishery products for heavy metals.\n(6) Decision 2006/236/EC should therefore be repealed accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/236/EC is hereby repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a031, 1.2.2002, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a083, 22.3.2006, p.\u00a016.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0215, 12.8.2008, p.\u00a06."}
