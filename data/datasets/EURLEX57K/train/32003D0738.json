It is therefore desirable to increase the face value of euro coins which the Vatican City State may issue annually and in special circumstances. The total face value of coins issued by the Vatican City State annually forms part of the ceiling of coins issued by the Italian Republic which is submitted to the European Central Bank for prior approval under Article 106(2) of the Treaty.\n(6) On 3 January 2003, the Italian Republic officially requested(5) an increase in the maximum annual face value of euro coins the Vatican City State may issue under both normal and special circumstances. The new ceilings proposed by the Italian Republic fully correspond to the maximum numbers of coins which were explicitly authorised under the earlier Monetary Convention.\n(7) The Italian Republic should be authorised to give effect to the amendments to the Monetary Convention,", "main_body": ["1.
