In order to make farmers' incomes less dependent on weather conditions, such areas should continue to be eligible under certain conditions.\n(3) With a view to preventing aid from being paid in combination on silage grass under different measures, cultivated parcels registered for the production of seed certified in accordance with Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seeds(7), as last amended by Directive 98/96/EC(8), should not be eligible for area payments.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1038/2001 allows organic producers to use legume crops grown on areas set aside. Those crops and the conditions governing the granting of the aid should be stipulated.\n(5) If all producers are to be able to take advantage of the possibility provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1038/2001, a new time limit must be allowed for amending applications for area payments as provided for in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2721/2000(10).\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 823/2001 of 24 April 2001 amending Regulation (EEC) No 738/93 amending the transitional measures governing the common organisation of the market in cereals and rice in Portugal as provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90(11) maintains for the 2001/02 marketing year the rate of the special aid applying for 2000/01. For the sake of consistency, the supplement to the aid for compulsory set-aside in Portugal fixed in Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 should be adjusted.\n(7) A new variety of flax grown for fibre can be deemed eligible for the aid. It should be added to the list of varieties eligible under the aid scheme set out in Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999.\n(8) To allow this new variety to be used in the 2001/02 marketing year, it should be incorporated retroactively with effect from 15 May 2001 in accordance with Article 7a(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals and the Committee for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
