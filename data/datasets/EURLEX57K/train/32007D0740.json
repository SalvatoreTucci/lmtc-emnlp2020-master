By letter dated 17 July 2007, the Commission notified the Kingdom of the Netherlands that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.\n(3) The arrangement would authorise the Kingdom of the Netherlands to apply in the ready-to-wear clothing industry a scheme for shifting the subcontractor\u2019s obligation to pay over VAT to the tax authorities from the subcontractor to the clothing firm (the contractor).\n(4) These arrangements have proved in the past to be an effective fraud-prevention measure in a sector in which collecting VAT is rendered awkward by the difficulty of identifying and supervising the activities of subcontractors. The requested measure is therefore to be considered as a measure to prevent certain types of tax evasion and avoidance in the ready-to-wear clothing industry.\n(5) Since, however, the location for the manufacture of ready-to-wear clothes is influenced by low labour costs and subcontractors relocate easily from one country to another, the Kingdom of the Netherlands should monitor and evaluate the impact of these factors on the effectiveness of the derogation and inform the Commission accordingly.\n(6) It is appropriate that the measure be limited in time in order to allow the Commission to evaluate it on the basis of the report provided by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n(7) The derogation does not have an adverse effect on the Communities\u2019 own resources accruing from value added tax nor does it affect the amount of VAT charged at the final stage of consumption,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Kingdom of the Netherlands is hereby authorised to apply a scheme until 31 December 2009 in the ready-to-wear clothing industry for shifting the subcontractor\u2019s obligation to pay over VAT to the tax authorities from the subcontractor to the clothing firm (the contractor).", "By 31 July 2009, the Kingdom of the Netherlands shall submit a report to the Commission on the overall evaluation of the operation of the measure concerned, in particular as regards the effectiveness of the measure and any other evidence of relocations of subcontractors in the ready-to-wear clothing industry to other countries.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 November 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
