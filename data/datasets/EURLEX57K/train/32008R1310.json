The amount of such financial compensation should be reduced by standard values in the case of products intended for purposes other than human consumption.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2493/2001 of 19 December 2001 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been withdrawn from the market\u00a0(2) specifies the ways of disposing of the products withdrawn from the market.
