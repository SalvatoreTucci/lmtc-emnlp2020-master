The Spanish authorities claim that the standard does not provide enough protection for projectiles toys intended for children above the age of three years. According to the Spanish authorities, a child older than three years might detach a suction cup from a projectile using a force higher than a force of 60 N laid down in clause 8.4.2.3 \u2018test for protective components\u2019.\n(7) The standard EN\u00a071-1:2005 lays down different requirements for toys with suction cups depending on the age of the child. Regarding toys with suction cups intended for children under the age of three years, the standard requires that the \u2018tension test\u2019 be performed with a tensile force of 50\u00a0N (in case the largest accessible dimension is 6\u00a0mm or less) or of 90\u00a0N (in case the largest accessible dimension is greater than 6\u00a0mm). Regarding projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area that are intended for children above the age of three years, the standard requires in clause 4.17.1(b) that resilient materials used as impact surfaces shall not become detached when tested according to clause 8.4.2.3 (tension test, protective components). The tension test for protective components specified in clause 8.4.2.3 is performed with a force of 60\u00a0N.\n(8) The Commission has been informed of several accidents with projectiles toys with a suction cup as an impact surface intended for children above the age of three years. In 1997, a Swedish child of nine years old suffocated to death after having sucked on a suction cup tip which he accidentally inhaled. Two other fatalities have occurred in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Commission has been informed of eight fatalities registered in the United States. More recently, in August 2005, the Spanish authorities informed the Commission of a fatal accident with a four years old child caused by a bow and arrow toy with a suction cup.\n(9) Suction cups affixed to projectile toys are intended for securing the projectile to a surface. Sticking and unsticking the projectiles imply that the suction cup is submitted to repeated stress. Furthermore, children above three years old often bring suction cups to their mouths to moisture the cups before sticking them on a surface. If the suction cup is not properly secured on the toy it is foreseeable that it can be detached during normal and foreseeable use. If the suction cup becomes detached and enters entirely in the mouth, it can block the airway at the back of the mouth and upper throat and cause asphyxiation.\n(10) On the basis of these findings, the Member States consider that children above the age of three years should be given the same protection as children under the age of three years. Thus, suction cups used as impact surfaces on toy projectiles intended for children over three years shall not become detached when submitted at least to the relevant tests laid down in clause 5.13.b of EN\u00a071-1:2005, in particular to \u2018torque test\u2019 (clause 8.3) and \u2018tension test, general\u2019 (clause 8.4.2.1).\n(11) Consequently, on the basis of the information submitted by the Spanish authorities, the other national authorities and the Committee on standards and technical regulations the Commission considers that the standard EN\u00a071-1:2005 presents shortcomings regarding the technical requirements for projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area intended for children above the age of three years.\n(12) Pending the revision of the standard, in the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate notice.\n(13) In absence of a standard that covers the abovementioned risks and according to Article 5(2) of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States shall presume that the abovementioned toys satisfy the essential safety requirements only if they have an EC type examination certificate issued by a notified body which conformity with the approved model has been certified by the affixation of the EC marking,", "main_body": ["In case of projectile toys with suction cups intended for children above the age of three years, the standard EN 71-1:2005 \u2018Safety of toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019 as adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation on 19 September 2005 does not satisfy the essential safety requirements referred to in the Article 3 of the Directive 88/378/EEC, in particular under Annex II.II.1 (e), in so far as concerns clause 4.17.1 (b).", "The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 \u2018Safety of toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019 shall be accompanied by the following additional notice:\n\u2018In case of projectiles toys with suction cups with an impact area, the requirement laid down in clause 4.17.1 (b), according to which the tension test is performed in accordance with clause 8.4.2.3, does not cover the risk of asphyxiation presented by these toys\u2019.", "A notice identical to that provided for in Article 2 of this Decision shall accompany the reference to a national standard transposing standard EN 71-1:2005 \u2018Safety of toys \u2014 Part 1: mechanical and physical properties\u2019, to be published by the Member States pursuant to Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 187, 16.7.1988, p. 1.
