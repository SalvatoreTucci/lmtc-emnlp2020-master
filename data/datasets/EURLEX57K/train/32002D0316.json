The plants produced are afterwards exported to the Community to be planted for fruit production.\n(3) For the 2001 season, by Commission Decision 2000/700/EC(3), derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of plants of Fragaria L., intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in the Republic of Chile have been authorised subject to specific conditions.\n(4) The circumstances justifying those derogations are still valid. There is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.\n(5) A derogation should therefore be authorised for a limited period, subject to specific conditions.\n(6) The authorisation pursuant to this Decision shall be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in the Annex thereof are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms or have not been complied with.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["The Member States are hereby authorised to provide for derogations from Article 4(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, with regard to the prohibitions referred to in Annex III, part A, point 18 to that Directive for plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in the Republic of Chile.\nIn order to qualify for this derogation, plants of Fragaria L., intended for planting, other than seeds, shall satisfy, in addition to the requirements laid down in Annexes I, II and IV to Directive 2000/29/EC, the conditions set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "Member States shall provide the Commission and the other Member States, before 30 November 2002, with the information on quantities imported pursuant to this Decision and with a detailed technical report of the official examination referred to in point 5 of the Annex.\nAny Member State in which the plants are planted, after the import, shall also provide the Commission and the other Member States, before 31 January 2003, with a detailed technical report of the official examination referred to in point 8 of the Annex.", "Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of all cases of consignments introduced into their territory pursuant to this Decision which were subsequently found not to comply with the conditions laid down herein.", "Article 1 shall apply from 1 June 2002 to 30 September 2002.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 April 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 77, 20.3.2002, p. 23.\n(3) OJ L 287, 14.11.2000, p. 65.\nANNEX\nSpecific conditions applying to plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in the Republic of Chile benefiting from the derogation provided for in Article 1 of this Decision\n1.
