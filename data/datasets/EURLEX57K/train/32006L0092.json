In the case of foodstuffs of animal origin, residue levels reflect the consumption by animals of cereals and products of plant origin treated with pesticides and, where relevant, the direct consequences of the use of veterinary medicines. Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected.\n(2) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data.\n(3) The Commission was informed that for several pesticides current MRLs may need to be revised in the light of the availability of new information on the toxicology and consumer intake. The Commission has asked the relevant rapporteur Member States to make proposals for the review of Community MRLs. Such proposals were submitted to the Commission.\n(4) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the pesticides referred to in this Directive via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(5). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.\n(5) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to those pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects.\n(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community\u2019s trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account.\n(7) The Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entries relating to captan, dichlorvos, ethion, and folpet are deleted.", "Directive 86/362/EEC is amended as follows:\n(a) in Part A of Annex II, the lines for captan, ethion and folpet as set out in Annex I to this Directive are added;\n(b) in Part A of Annex II, the line for dichlorvos is replaced by the text in Annex II to this Directive.", "Directive 90/642/EEC is amended as follows:\n(a) in Annex II, the lines for captan, and folpet as set out in Annex III to this Directive, are added;\n(b) in Annex II, the lines for dichlorvos and ethion, are replaced by the text in Annex IV to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 10 May 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
