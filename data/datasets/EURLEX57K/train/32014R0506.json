The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.\n(5) Subsequently, in April of 2007 the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) evaluated the safety of the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a food preservative and allocated an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0,5\u00a0mg/kg body weight\u00a0(4). Conservative estimates of exposure to the substance, both in adults and in children, suggested that it was likely that the ADI would be exceeded at the maximum proposed use levels for several food categories.\n(6) Following these conclusions, the applicant revised its uses and use levels and requested an authorisation of the use in heat-treated meat products. In July 2013 the Authority published a statement on a refined exposure assessment of Ethyl lauroyl arginate based on its revised proposed uses as a food additive\u00a0(5), and concluded that the exposure for all population groups is below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0,5\u00a0mg/kg bw/day.\n(7) There is a technological need to use Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a preservative in heat-treated meat products in order to improve the microbiological quality of those food products, including inhibiting the growth of harmful micro-organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes. As the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate in heat treated meat products will help maintaining their quality and safety, it is appropriate to authorise its use in heat-treated meat products and to assign number E 243 to that food additive.\n(8) The specifications for Ethyl lauroyl arginate (E 243) should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union list of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.\n(9) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 of 9 March 2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a083, 22.3.2012, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2007) 511, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013;11(6):3294.\nANNEX I\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Part B, point 3 \u2018Additives other than colours and sweeteners\u2019, the following new entry is inserted after the entry for \u2018E 242 Dimethyl dicarbonate\u2019:\n\u2018E 243 Ethyl lauroyl arginate\u2019\n(2) In Part E, in food category 08.2.2 \u2018Heat treated processed meat\u2019, the following new entry is inserted:\n\u2018E 243 Ethyl lauroyl arginate 160  Except emulsified sausages, smoked sausages and liver paste\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, the following new entry is inserted after the specifications for food additive E 242:\n\u2018E 243 ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE\nSynonyms Lauric arginate ethyl ester; lauramide arginine ethyl ester; ethyl-\u039d\u03b1-lauroyl-L-arginate\u0387HCl; LAE;\nDefinition Ethyl lauroyl arginate is synthesized by esterifying arginine with ethanol, followed by reacting the ester with lauroyl chloride.
