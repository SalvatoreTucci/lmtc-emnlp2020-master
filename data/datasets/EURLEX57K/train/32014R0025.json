Imports of fish species susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, as set out in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, from those provinces into the Union are therefore permitted.\n(5) Canada has requested that the province of Quebec should be added to the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008. According to the conclusions of an audit carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office in Canada in June 2012 concerning aquatic animal health, the competent authority of that third country can provide appropriate guarantees in relation to surveillance and monitoring of fish diseases, and a reliable certification system is in place for exports of fish and products thereof to the Union. In addition, the competent authority of Canada has submitted to the Commission detailed information with regard to a risk-based surveillance programme concerning viral haemorrhagic septicaemia carried out between 2007 and 2012 on wild fish originating from higher risk watersheds in the province of Quebec. From an analysis of the design and implementation of the surveillance programme it can be concluded that it is highly unlikely that the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus circulated in susceptible wild fish populations in Quebec during those years. That provides further assurances in respect of the health status of fish species susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, or products thereof, that may be exported to the Union from Quebec.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to permit imports of fish species susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, as set out in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, intended for farming, relaying areas, put and take fisheries, open and closed ornamental facilities, from Quebec into the Union.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 24.11.2006, p. 14.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 of 12 December 2008 implementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards conditions and certification requirements for the placing on the market and the import into the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof and laying down a list of vector species (OJ L 337, 16.12.2008, p. 41).\nANNEX\nIn Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, in the table, the entry for Canada is replaced by the following:\nCountry/territory Aquaculture Species Zone/Compartment\nISO-code Name Fish Molluscs Crustaceans Code Description\n\u2018CA Canada X   CA 0 (C) Whole territory\nCA 1 (D) British Columbia\nCA 2 (D) Alberta\nCA 3 (D) Saskatchewan\nCA 4 (D) Manitoba\nCA 5 (D) New Brunswick\nCA 6 (D) Nova Scotia\nCA 7 (D) Prince Edward Island\nCA 8 (D) Newfoundland and Labrador\nCA 9 (D) Yukon\nCA 10 (D) Northwest Territories\nCA 11 (D) Nunavut\nCA 12 (D) Quebec\u2019"}
