The CVMP recommended in its revised opinion that, for the purpose of monitoring the residues of ivermectin that, where the entire carcass is available, fat, liver or kidney should be sampled in preference to muscle as residues in these tissues deplete more slowly than residues in muscle.\n(8) The entry for ivermectin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include MRLs for the pharmaceutical substance for all mammalian food producing species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals producing milk for human consumption.\n(9) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 24 June 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance ivermectin is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active substance Marker residue Animal species MRL Target tissues Other provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic classification\n\u2018Ivermectin 22, 23-Dihydro-avermectin B 1a All mammalian food producing species 30 \u03bcg/kg Muscle For porcine species the fat MRL relates to \u201cskin and fat in natural proportions\u201d Antiparasitic agents/Agents acting against endo and ectoparasites\u2019"}
