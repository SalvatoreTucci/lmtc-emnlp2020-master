PROCEDURE\n(1) Definitive countervailing duties were imposed on the above product on 14 November 1998 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2450/98(2). Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for an interim review, pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, from an Indian exporting producer, Chandan Steel Ltd, which participated in the original investigation and is currently subject to a countervailing duty rate of 19,0 %. The company concerned provided sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of the measure was no longer necessary to offset the countervailable subsidy.\n(2) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of an interim review of Regulation (EC) No 2450/98 with regard to Chandan Steel Ltd.\n2. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST FOR REVIEW\n(3) On 10 May 2000, the company concerned withdrew its request for a review. The Commission has therefore decided to terminate this review without amending the measures in relation to Chandan Steel Ltd,", "main_body": ["The interim review of Regulation (EC) No 2450/98 concerning imports of stainless steel bright bars originating in India is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 December 2000.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 288, 21.10.1997, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 304, 14.11.1998, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 22, 26.1.2000, p. 7."}
