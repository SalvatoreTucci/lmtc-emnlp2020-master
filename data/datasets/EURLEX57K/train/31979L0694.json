Where the separate Directives make express provision for so doing, EEC type-approval may also be granted for types of systems or parts of tractors which form a separate technical unit.\n2. Where the separate technical unit to be approved fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other components of the tractor and for this reason compliance with one or more requirements can be verified only when the separate technical unit to be approved operates in conjunction with other tractor components, whether real or simulated, the scope of the EEC type-approval of the separate technical unit must be restricted accordingly. The EEC type-approval certificate for a separate technical unit shall then include any restrictions on its use and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it. Observance of these restrictions and conditions shall be verified at the time of EEC type-approval of the tractor.  (1)OJ No C 127, 21.5.1979, p. 80.
