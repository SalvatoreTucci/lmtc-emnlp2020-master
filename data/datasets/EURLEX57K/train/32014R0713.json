Products falling within those tariff quotas can be imported into the Union at reduced or zero duty rates. For the reasons indicated, it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2014, tariff quotas at zero duty rates for an appropriate volume as regards six additional products.\n(2) Moreover, in certain cases, the existing autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be adapted. In the case of two products, the product description needs to be modified for clarification purposes and in order to take into account the most recent product developments. In the case of another product, one of the TARIC codes needs to be deleted as the double classification has become obsolete. In the case of three other products, the quota volumes need to be increased as such increase is in the interest of economic operators and of the Union.\n(3) Finally, in the case of two products, the autonomous tariff quotas of the Union should be closed with effect from 1 July 2014 and 1 January 2015, respectively, as it is not in the Union's interest to continue granting them as from those dates.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) As some of the adaptations to the autonomous tariff quotas pursuant to this Regulation must take effect from 1\u00a0July 2014, this Regulation should apply from that date and enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["The table in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013 is amended as follows:\n(1) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2830, 09.2831, 09.2832, 09.2834, 09.2835 and 09.2836 set out in Annex I to this Regulation are inserted following the order of the CN codes indicated in the second column of the table in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1388/2013;\n(2) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2629, 09.2631, 09.2639, 09.2668, 09.2669, 09.2806 and\u00a009.2818 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n(3) the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2930 is deleted;\n(4) the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2639 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2014, with the exception of point (4) of Article 1, which shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 24 June 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
