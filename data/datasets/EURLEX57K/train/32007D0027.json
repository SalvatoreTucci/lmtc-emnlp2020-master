It provides that food business operators are to comply with the structural requirements based on those principles. Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin\u00a0(2) supplements the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. The rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 include specific requirements for milk processing establishments, as well as hygiene requirements concerning raw milk and dairy products.\n(2) Romania is due to accede to the Community on 1 January 2007. In preparation for that accession, milk processing establishments are undergoing the necessary structural improvements in order to comply with the structural requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. Since 2004 the number of establishments in compliance with Community structural requirements has increased from 12 to 123.\n(3) However, the proportion of raw milk that complies with the hygiene requirements, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, delivered to milk processing establishments that comply with the structural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 has only increased slightly. In 2005 out of the total production of 5,6 Mio t raw cow milk per year, 0,38 Mio t compliant raw milk was delivered to milk processing establishments.\n(4) Taking into account the current situation, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures as regards the organisation of the milk sector in Romania.\n(5) In this respect, Annex VII, Chapter 5, Subsection I, point (c) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, authorises temporarily certain milk processing establishments that do not comply with the structural requirements laid down in Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 to receive deliveries of raw milk that does not comply with the relevant hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (\u2018non-compliant milk\u2019).\n(6) Milk production holdings that do not comply with the hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and milk processing establishments that do comply with the structural requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 are spread over the whole territory of Romania. Accordingly, certain of the compliant establishments receive raw milk that complies with the relevant hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (\u2018compliant milk\u2019) as well as non-compliant milk. Therefore, the marketing of final products from the compliant establishments should be restricted to Romania. In addition, a list of those compliant establishments should be set out in this Decision.\n(7) Furthermore, certain compliant establishments intend to process separately compliant and non-compliant milk. It is therefore necessary to establish the conditions as regards the collection and treatment of such milk and the marketing of the final products thereof. A list of those compliant establishments processing those two types of milk should also be set out in this Decision.\n(8) The transitional period granted should be limited to 18 months. The situation of the milk sector in Romania is to be reviewed before the end of that period. Accordingly, it is appropriate that Romania submit annual reports to the Commission regarding progress in the upgrading of milk production holdings supplying raw milk to compliant establishments.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lists of compliant
