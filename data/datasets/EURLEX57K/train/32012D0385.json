It is therefore necessary to obtain the formula for this new method.\n(3) Denmark has requested the Commission to authorise that new method for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which this method is based, the results of its dissection trial and the equation used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof\u00a0(3).\n(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising that grading method are fulfilled. That grading method should therefore be authorised in Denmark.\n(5) Decision 2009/12/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Implementing Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Decision 2009/12/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, the following point (g) is added:\n\u2018(g) the \u201cAutomatic ultrasound instrument (AutoFOM III)\u201d apparatus and the assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 7 of the Annex.\u2019;\n(2) the Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nDacian CIOLO\u0218\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 6, 10.1.2009, p.\u00a083.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 16.12.2008, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nIn the Annex to Decision 2009/12/EC the following Part 7 is added:\n\u2018Part 7\nAUTOMATIC ULTRASOUND INSTRUMENT (AutoFOM III)\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cAutoFOM III\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with sixteen 2\u00a0MHz ultrasonic transducers (Carometec A/S), with an operating distance between transducers of 25\u00a0mm. The ultrasonic data shall comprise measurements of back fat thickness, muscle thickness and related parameters. The results of the measurements are converted into estimates of the percentage of lean meat by using a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of a carcass shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n4. The measuring points are described in Part II of the protocol presented to the Commission by Denmark in accordance with Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008\u00a0(1).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 16.12.2008, p.\u00a03.\u2019"}
