Directive 2004/49/EC also provides equal treatment for all railway undertakings by applying the same safety certification requirements throughout the European Union.\n(2) On 5 October 2009 the Commission issued a mandate to the European Railway Agency (\u2018the Agency\u2019) in accordance with Directive 2004/49/EC to draw up a draft common safety method (CSM) for supervision by national safety authorities after issuing a safety certificate or a safety authorisation to railway undertakings and infrastructure managers. The Agency submitted its recommendation on the CSM to the Commission, supported by an impact assessment report, in agreement with the mandate of the Commission. This Regulation is based on the recommendation by the Agency.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1158/2010 of 9 December 2010 on a common safety method for assessing conformity with the requirements for obtaining railway safety certificates\u00a0(2) provides a method for assessing conformity with requirements for obtaining safety certificates to be issued in accordance with Article 10(2)(a) and Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2004/49/EC. That Regulation defines the criteria against which assessment by national safety authorities must be carried out, describes the procedures to follow and establishes the principles to be observed by national safety authorities during supervision as defined in that Regulation after issuing a safety certificate.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1169/2010 of 10 December 2010 on a common safety method for assessing conformity with the requirements for obtaining a railway safety authorisation\u00a0(3) includes all the harmonised requirements and assessment methods by means of which national safety authorities can issue an infrastructure manager with a safety authorisation under Article 11 of Directive 2004/49/EC covering the adequacy of the safety management system in general and any network-specific authorisation. That Regulation also defines the criteria against which assessment by national safety authorities must be carried out, describes the procedures to follow and establishes the principles to be used by national safety authorities during supervision, as defined in that Regulation, after issuing a safety authorisation.\n(5) After issuing a safety certificate or a safety authorisation, the national safety authority must put in place arrangements to check whether the results outlined in the application for a safety certificate or a safety authorisation are being achieved during operation and that all the necessary requirements are complied with on a continuous basis, as required by Article 16(2)(e) and Article 17(2) of Directive 2004/49/EC.\n(6) To be able to perform its tasks under Article 16(2)(f) of Directive 2004/49/EC, the national safety authority also needs to judge, based on its supervision activities, the effectiveness of the safety regulatory framework. \u2018Supervision\u2019 means the arrangements put in place by the national safety authority to oversee safety performance after it has granted a safety certificate or safety authorisation.\n(7) In undertaking supervision, the national safety authority must apply the fundamental principles of national safety authority supervision activity \u2014 proportionality, consistency, targeting, transparency, accountability and cooperation \u2014 as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1158/2010 and in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2010. However, these principles also need a framework and process to apply them in practice in the day-to-day activities of the national safety authorities. The current Regulation would provide the necessary framework and process to the national safety authorities, while improving the mutual trust in their approaches to, and decision-making during supervision activities.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 27(1) of Directive 2004/49/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation establishes a common safety method (CSM) of supervision of the safety performance after issuing a safety certificate for railway undertakings or a safety authorisation for infrastructure managers as referred to in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1158/2010 and Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2010 respectively.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National safety authorities shall apply the common safety method to oversee compliance with the legal obligation on a railway undertaking or infrastructure manager to use a safety management system to ensure the control of all risks associated with their activities including the supply of maintenance and material and the use of contractors and, where appropriate, to check the application of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1078/2012 of 16 November 2012 on a common safety method for monitoring to be applied by railway undertakings, infrastructure managers after receiving a safety certificate or safety authorisation and by entities in charge of maintenance\u00a0(4).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National safety authorities shall use this Regulation to perform their supervision activities under Article 16(2)(f) of Directive 2004/49/EC and to advise the Member States on the effectiveness of the safety regulatory framework.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, \u2018supervision\u2019 has the meaning provided for by Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1158/2010 and Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2010.", "Supervision strategy and plan(s)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national safety authority shall develop and implement a supervision strategy and plan(s) outlining how it targets its activities and sets its priorities for supervision as set out in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national safety authority shall collect and analyse information from a variety of sources.
