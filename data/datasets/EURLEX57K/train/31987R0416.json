whereas it is therefore appropriate to include such varieties among the varieties recommended for the same administrative units or the administrative units immediately bordering thereon in accordance with Article 11 (1) (a) and (2) (a), second indent, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 347/79 of 5 February 1979 on general rules for the classification of vine varieties (5), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece;\nWhereas the classification of wine grape vine varieties should now include, among the varieties recommended or authorized for certain French and Italian administrative units and one German administrative unit, certain varieties which have been listed for at least five years in the category for an administrative unit immediately bordering thereon and which therefore satisfy the condition laid down in the first indent of Article 11 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;\nWhereas the classification should now also include a wine grape vine variety which has been examined and found to be satisfactory for cultivation; whereas, in accordance with Article 11 (1) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79, this variety may be authorized on a provisional basis for certain French administrative units;\nWhereas the suitability for cultivation of certain wine grape vine varieties which have been listed for at least five years in the category of varieties temporarily authorized for certain Italian administrative units has been recognized as satisfactory; whereas those varieties should therefore be definitively included among the vine varieties authorized for the same administrative units in accordance with Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;\nWhereas the suitability for cultivation of one recognized vine variety in one Italian administrative unit is not satisfactory; whereas that variety should therefore be deleted from the classification in accordance with Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;\nWhereas experience has shown that the requirements for maintaining two vine varieties among the varieties recommended for one Italian administrative unit are no longer satisfied; whereas those varieties should therefore be classified among the varieties authorized for the same administrative unit in accordance with Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 11 (1) (a), second indent, of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79, the classification of root stock varieties for France should also include one variety which has been examined and found to be satisfactory for cultivation;\nWhereas colonal selection within the population of the Courbu Blanc B variety has enabled the Petit Courbu B variety to be clearly distinguished and its characteristics to be described in relation to the various clones of the Courbu Blanc B variety; whereas, as the morphological characteristics of the Petit Courbu B variety are definite and enable homogeneous trial plots to be established, the Petit Courbu B variety should be included in the classification of vine varieties for the same administrative units and in the same category as the Courbu Blanc B variety;\nWhereas an oversight should be made good by providing for the definitive classification under the authorized varieties, of one vine variety classified among the varieties temporarily authorized for one French administrative unit in accordance with Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;\nWhereas certain varieties of table wine no longer satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 7 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79 for recommended vine varieties;
