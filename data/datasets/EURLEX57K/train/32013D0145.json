Roshan Money Exchange stores and transfers funds in support of Taliban military operations and the Taliban\u2019s role in the Afghan narcotics trade. As of 2011, Roshan Money Exchange was one of the primary money service providers (or \u201chawalas\u201d) used by Taliban officials in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\nAhmed Shah has provided hawala services to Taliban leaders in Helmand Province for a number of years and, as of 2011, was a trusted Taliban money service provider. In early 2012, the Taliban ordered Ahmed Shah to transfer money to a number of hawalas in Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, from which a senior Taliban commander would then allocate the funds.\nIn late 2011, Ahmed Shah consolidated hundreds of thousands of US dollars to pass to the Taliban Finance Commission and transferred hundreds of thousands of US dollars for the Taliban, including to senior Taliban commanders. Also in late 2011, Ahmed Shah received through his hawala branch in Quetta, Pakistan, a transfer on behalf of the Taliban, money from which was used to purchase fertilizer and IED components, including batteries and detonator cord. In mid-2011, Taliban finance commission head Gul Agha Ishakzai instructed Ahmed Shah to deposit several million US dollars into Roshan Money Exchange for the Taliban. Gul Agha explained that when a money transfer was required, he would inform Ahmed Shah of the Taliban recipient. Ahmed Shah would then provide the required funds through his hawala system. As of mid-2010, Ahmed Shah moved money between Pakistan and Afghanistan for Taliban commanders and for narcotics traffickers. In addition to his facilitation activities, Ahmed Shah also donated large but unspecified sums of money to the Taliban in 2011."}
