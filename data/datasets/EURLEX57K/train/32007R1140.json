This application is therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the enzyme preparation endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553), bacillolysin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9554) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005\u00a0(3).\n(6) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for four years of that preparation for laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered its opinion on that use on 18 April 2007. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation, as specified in Annex to this Regulation, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(7) The assessment of this application shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(4).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, as specified in the Annex, is authorised provisionally for four years as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 October 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
