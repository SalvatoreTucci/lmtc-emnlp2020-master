Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2006/66/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 2006/66/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive 2006/66/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
