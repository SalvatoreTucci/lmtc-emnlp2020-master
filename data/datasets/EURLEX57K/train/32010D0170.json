The reference of the standard was first published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 August 2003\u00a0(3).\n(2) The United Kingdom has lodged a formal objection in respect of standard EN 353-1:2002.\n(3) With regard to clause 4.7 of EN 353-1:2002, the United Kingdom considers that the specifications relating to the user instructions fail to satisfy the requirements set out in Section 1.4(a) and (b) of Annex II to the Directive.\n(4) With regard to clause 5 of standard EN 353-1:2002, the United Kingdom considers that the test method prescribed does not test for reasonably foreseeable fall conditions such as a \u2018fall back\u2019 or \u2018sideways\u2019 fall, which leads to a significant risk that the device could fail. Consequently, the United Kingdom considers that the standard fails to satisfy the requirements set out in Sections 1.1.1 and 3.1.2.2 of Annex II to the Directive.\n(5) Having examined standard EN 353-1:2002 the Commission has established that the standard fails to fully satisfy the basic health and safety requirements set out in Sections 1.1.1, 1.4 and 3.1.2.2 of Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC.\n(6) The reference of standard EN 353-1:2002 should therefore be withdrawn from the list of harmonised standards in the Official Journal of the European Union, with the result that compliance with relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standard EN 353-1:2002 no longer confers the presumption of conformity to the basic requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC,", "main_body": ["The reference of standard EN 353-1:2002 \u2018Personal protective equipment against falls from a height \u2014 Part 1: Guided type fall arresters including a rigid anchor line\u2019 is withdrawn from the list of harmonised standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0399, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a018.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0204, 21.7.1998, p.\u00a037.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0203, 28.8.2003, p.\u00a010."}
