Therefore, pyraclostrobin was included in Annex I to that Directive with the specific provision that Member States may only authorise uses as fungicide.\n(3) In addition to the control of fungi in certain agricultural uses, the notifier now has applied for an amendment to those specific provisions to allow pyraclostrobin to be used as a plant growth regulator. In order to support such an extension of the use, the notifier submitted additional information.\n(4) Germany evaluated the information and data submitted by the notifier. Germany informed the Commission in October 2008 about its conclusion that the requested extension of use does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for pyraclostrobin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. In particular, the extension does not involve a modification of the application parameters, as set out in the specific provisions of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(5) Therefore it is justified to modify the specific provisions for pyraclostrobin.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 3 August 2009 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
