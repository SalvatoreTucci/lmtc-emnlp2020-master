The objectives of that survey are to further investigate the PrP gene of goats in that Member State in order to confirm the results of previous preliminary studies where specific PrP polymorphisms were found indicating resistance against TSEs and to evaluate the data in order to be able to determine the baseline prevalence of TSE resistant PrP genes in goats. Cyprus has a very high prevalence of TSEs in goats and is therefore the appropriate Member State to carry out such pilot project. The survey started on 1 January 2006.\n(3) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005\u00a0(2) of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, animal disease eradication and control programmes (veterinary measures) are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation are to apply.\n(4) Commission Decision 2006/140/EC of 15 February 2006 concerning a specific financial contribution from the Community relating to the survey on TSE resistant PrP genes in goats presented by Cyprus for the year 2006\u00a0(3) granted a financial contribution from the Community for the year 2006 for the study of genetic resistance to TSE in goats in that Member State.\n(5) For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year. It is appropriate to grant a financial contribution from the Community for that survey to cover the year 2007. Decision 2006/140/EC should therefore be amended to cover that year.\n(6) The Annex to Decision 2006/140/EC lists the financial assistance of the Community and also the means of technical and financial reporting. That annex should be amended to take account of financial assistance for the year 2007 and also changes in reporting for that year.\n(7) For reasons of administrative efficiency all expenditure presented for a financial contribution by the Community should be expressed in euro. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the conversion rate for expenditure in a currency other than euro should be the rate most recently set by the European Central Bank prior to the first day of the month in which the application is submitted by Cyprus.\n(8) Decision 2006/140/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/140/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
