The last subparagraph of Article 1 (a) provides that the inclusion in the category of the arrondissements of Hasselt, Masseik and Tongeren in the province of Limburg is to be limited to a period of three years from the date of that Decision;  the Commission is to review the socio-economic situation of those arrondissements before that period expires.\nThe Commission carried out the said review in 1985 and, in its Decision 85/544/EEC (2), replaced the last subparagraph of Article 1 (a) of Decision 82/740/EEC by the following:\n\u00c2\u00b4The inclusion in this category of the arrondissements of Hasselt, Maaseik and Tongeren in the province of Limburg shall be limited to a period ending on 22 July 1988; the Commission shall review the socio-economic situation of those arrondissements  before that period expires.'  By letter dated 17 May 1988, the Belgian Governement forwarded to the Commission information on the socio-economic situation in the arrondissements referred to above.\nOn the basis of that information and the other statistical data in its possession, the Commission has reviewed the socio-economic situation in those arrondissements as provided for in Article 1 of Decision 85/544/EEC.\nIt is apparent from the Commission's review that the unemployment situation in the arrondissement of Maaseik improved slightly between 1984 and 1988, but that unemployment remains high.\nThe situation in the arrondissements of Tongeren and Hasselt also improved between 1984 and the beginning of 1987, but subsequently declined as a result of the closure of three coalmines in the arrondissement of Hasselt between September 1987 and March  1988.\nOverall, the review indicates that the conditions for granting the derogatiosn provided for in Article 1 (a) of Decision 82/740/EEC are still met. The maintenance of a 20 % ceiling for the three arrondissements is therefore justifiable for a period of  three years, during which time the situation in Limburg could again improve. The Commission is to review the situation before that period expires,", "main_body": ["The last subparagraph of Article 1 (a) of Decision 82/740/EEC is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u00c2\u00b4The inclusion in this category of the arrondissements of Hasselt, Masseik, and Tongeren in the province of Limburg shall be limited to a period ending on 22 July 1991; the Commission shall review the socio-economic situation of those arrondissements  before that period expires.'
