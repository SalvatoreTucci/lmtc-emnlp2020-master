As an alternative treatment, a capital transfer to the relevant sectors could be recorded equal to the same adjustment. The coefficients shall be estimated on the basis of past experience and current expectations in respect of assessed and declared amounts never collected. They shall be specific to different types of taxes and social contributions. The determination of these coefficients shall be country-specific, the method being cleared with the Commission (Eurostat) beforehand.\n(b) If cash receipts are used, they shall be time-adjusted so that the cash is attributed when the activity took place to generate the tax liability (or when the amount of tax was determined, in the case of some income taxes). This adjustment may be based on the average time difference between the activity (or the determination of the amount of tax) and cash tax receipt.", "Verification\n1.
