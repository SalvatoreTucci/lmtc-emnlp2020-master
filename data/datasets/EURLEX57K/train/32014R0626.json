It provides in point 4.3 a list of recommended denaturants which are not harmful to vehicle systems. The substances named in this list are: automotive petrol conforming to EN 228, ethyltertbutylether (ETBE), methyltertbutylether (MTBE), tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol), and 2-propanol (isopropanol). One or more of those denaturants may be used in the mixture, except isobutanol and isopropanol that are easily separable from the mixture. Therefore they always need to be used in combination with another denaturant.\n(6) A new Additional note should therefore be added to Chapter 22 of Part Two of the CN to ensure its uniform interpretation throughout the Union.\n(7) The Customs Code Committee has not issued an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 22 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the following Additional note 12 is added:\n\u201812.
