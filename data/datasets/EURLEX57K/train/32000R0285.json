This number has not been changed since then, despite the significant reduction in the number of holdings in Greece. The reduction has been accompanied by an increase in the average size of the holdings and in their uniformity, which is such that it enables satisfactory representativeness to be achieved on the basis of a smaller sample than the current one. Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee on the farm accountancy data network,", "main_body": ["The table for Greece in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 is hereby replaced by the table annexed to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 1999 accounting year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 February 2000.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ 109, 23.6.1965, p. 1859/65.\n(2) OJ L 174, 2.7.1997, p. 7.\n(3) OJ L 205, 13.7.1982, p. 5.\n(4) OJ L 14, 17.1.1997, p. 28.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
