Scope and field of application\nThe method determines the loss of organic matter from ion exchange resins.\n2. Definition\nThe loss of organic matter from ion exchange resins:\nThe loss of organic matter is determined by the method specified.\n3. Principle\nExtracting solvents are passed through prepared resins and the weight of organic matter extracted is determined gravimetrically.\n4. Reagents\nAll reagents should be of analytical quality grade.\nExtracting solvents:\n4.1. Distilled water or de-ionized water of equivalent purity.\n4.2. Ethanol, 15 % v/v. Prepare by mixing 15 volumes of absolute ethanol with 85 volumes of water (4.1).\n4.3. Acetic acid, 5 % m/m. Prepare by mixing 5 parts of weight glacial acetic acid with 95 parts by weight of water (4.1).\n5. Apparatus\n5.1. Ion exchange chromatograph columns.\n5.2. Measuring cylinders, capacity 2 l.\n5.3. Evaporating dishes, capable of withstanding a muffle furnace at 850 \u00b0C.\n5.4. Drying oven, thermostatically controlled at 105 + or - 2 \u00b0C.\n5.5. Muffle furnace, thermostatically controlled at 850 + or - 25 \u00b0C.\n5.6. Analytical balance, accurate to 0,1 mg.\n5.7. Evaporator, hot plate or infra-red evaporator.\n6. Procedure\n6.1. Add to each of three separate ion exchange chromatography columns (5.1) 50 ml of the ion exchange resin to be tested, having been washed and treated in accordance with the manufacturers direction for preparing them for use with food.\n6.2. Pass the three extracting solvents (4.1, 4.2 and 4.3) separately, through the prepared columns (6.1) at a flow rate of 350 to 450 ml/h. Discard the first litre of eluate in each case and collect the next two litres in measuring cylinders (5.2).\n6.3. Evaporate the three eluates over a hot plate or infra-red evaporator (5.7) in separate evaporating dishes (5.3) which have been previously cleaned and weighted (m0). Place the dishes in an oven (5.4) and dry to constant weight (m1).\n6.4. After recording the constant weight (6.3), place the evaporating dish in the muffle furnace (5.5) ash to constant weight (m2).\n6.5. Calculate the organic matter extracted (7.1). If the result is greater than 1 mg/l, carry out a blank test on the reagents and recalculate the content of organic matter extracted.\nThe blank test should be carried out by repeating sections 6.3 and 6.4 but using two litres of the extracting solvent, to give weights of m3 and m4 in sections 6.3 and 6.4 respectively. 7. Expression of results\n7.1. Formula and calculation of results.\nThe organic matter extracted from ion exchange resins, in mg/l, is given by:\n500 (m1 - m2)\nwhere m1 and m2 are in g.\nThe correct organic matter extracted from ion exchange resins, in mg/l, is given by:\n500 (m1 - m2 - m3 + m4)\nwhere m1, m2, m3 and m4 are in g.\n7.2. The difference in the results between two parallel determinations carried out on the same sample shall not exceed 0,2 mg/l."}
