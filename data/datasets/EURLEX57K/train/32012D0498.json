For the subsectors \u2018Voiles, webs, mats, mattresses, boards and other articles of glass fibres, except woven fabrics\u2019 and \u2018Slag wool, rock wool and similar mineral wools and mixtures thereof, in bulk, sheets or rolls\u2019, this assessment has shown that they can be clearly distinguished from other subsectors on the basis of specific characteristics and that they satisfy the quantitative criteria set out in Article 10a(15) of Directive 2003/87/EC. Accordingly, the subsectors \u2018Voiles, webs, mats, mattresses, boards and other articles of glass fibres, except woven fabrics\u2019 and \u2018Slag wool, rock wool and similar mineral wools and mixtures thereof, in bulk, sheets or rolls\u2019 should be added to the list of sectors and subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage.\n(5) NACE 4-level code 2614 \u2018Manufacture of glass fibres\u2019 consists of two 6-digit Prodcom codes: \u2018261411 Slivers, rovings, yarn and chopped strands, of glass fibre\u2019 and \u2018261412 Voiles, webs, mats, mattresses, boards and other articles of glass fibres, except woven fabrics\u2019. The subsector covered by 6-digit Prodcom code 261411 was deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage in Decision 2010/2/EU. By adding also Prodcom code 261412 to the list of sectors and subsectors which are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage, the entire sector at NACE 4-level 2614 will be covered. Therefore, for reasons of clarity and to avoid duplication, NACE 4-level code 2614 has been added to Section 1.2 of the list, while Prodcom code 261411 is deleted from Section 2.\n(6) Decisions 2010/2/EU and 2011/278/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Decision 2010/2/EU\nThe Annex to Decision 2010/2/EU is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "Amendments to Decision 2011/278/EU\nAnnex I to Decision 2011/278/EU is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 August 2012.\nFor the Commission\nConnie HEDEGAARD\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 1, 5.1.2010, p. 10.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 130, 17.5.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe Annex to Decision 2010/2/EU is amended as follows:\n1.
