It acts against fungi and bacteria and is in particular useful to limit pasteurisation. This use allows an effective preservation of drinks without altering their flavour and taste. In addition a limited pasteurisation will be more cost effective and environmental friendly. The substance is currently authorised for use in several categories of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.\n(6) Dimethyl dicarbonate (E 242) was last evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food in 2001\u00a0(3). The substance is considered to be of no toxicological concern as at the use level of 250\u00a0mg/l it is unstable and breaks down in substances the residues of which are considered harmless. This implies that this use does not represent a hazard to health. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of dimethyl dicarbonate (E 242) for the preservation of all products belonging to category 14.2.8 (\u2018Other alcoholic drinks including mixtures of alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks and spirits with less than 15\u00a0% of alcohol\u2019).\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of dimethyl dicarbonate (E 242) for the preservation of all products belonging to category 14.2.8 constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives\u00a0(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of dimethyl dicarbonate (E 242) for the preservation of all products belonging to category 14.2.8 before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to that food additive.\n(9) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0SCF/CS/ADD/CONS/43 Final, 12 July 2001.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 295, 12.11.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the entry for additive E 242 in food category 14.2.8 \u2018Other alcoholic drinks including mixtures of alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks and spirits with less than 15\u00a0% of alcohol\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018E 242 Dimethyl dicarbonate 250 (24)  Period of application:"}
