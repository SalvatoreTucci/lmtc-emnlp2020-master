Maximum levels have been established for amongst others patulin.\n(2) A maximum level of 10,0 \u03bcg/kg has been established for apple juice and solid apple products, including apple compote and apple puree, for infants and young children and other baby food on the condition that a method of analysis would have been validated by an international collaborative ring trial to be performed before 1 November 2003 in order to demonstrate that the level of 10 \u03bcg/kg patulin can be reliably determined. In case there was no evidence by 1 November 2003 that the level of 10 \u03bcg/kg could be reliably determined, the level of 25 \u03bcg/kg would apply.\n(3) A collaborative trial has been organised to provide the evidence that the level of 10,0 \u03bcg/kg can be reliably determined. A report indicating that a method can reliably determine levels of patulin in clear apple juice and fruit puree at 10 \u03bcg/kg and lower has been provided on 27 October 2003.\n(4) It is appropriate to adopt transitional arrangements for products manufactured and put on the market before the date of application.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
