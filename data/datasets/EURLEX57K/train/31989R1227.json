 whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to ensure that supplies are available and that they reach consumers at reasonable prices;\nWhereas the target price referred to above must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Articles 4 and 6 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC;\nWhereas, if the producer is to receive a fair income, production aid must be fixed in the light of the impact which the consumption aid has on part only of the production;\nWhereas the intervention price must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 8 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC;\nWhereas, as a result of the application of Articles 68 and 236 of the Act of Accession, the intervention price for olive oil in Spain and Portugal differs from the common prices; whereas, after the adjustment of the \u00c2\u00b4acquis communautaire' with relation  to vegetable oils and fats, the detailed rules for the alignment of intervention prices for olive oil applicable in Spain and Portugal are those set out in the second indents\nof Article 92 (2) and of Article 290 (2) of the Act of Accession;\nWhereas Articles 95 and 293 of the Act of Accession provide for the granting of Community aid for the production of olive oil in Spain and in Portugal; whereas, pursuant to Articles 79 and 246 of that Act, the amounts of the Community aid in Spain and  Portugal should be aligned on the common aid at the beginning of the marketing year; whereas the rules on this alignment result in the Spanish and Portuguese aid rates shown below;\nWhereas the production target price and the intervention price are fixed for a specific standard quality; whereas the reasons which led to the determination of the standard quality for the 1981/82 marketing year are still valid; whereas that standard  quality should therefore remain unchanged;\nWhereas, under Article 5 (4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, a percentage of the production earmarked for producers may be allocated to the financing of regional measures to improve the quality of olive oil production; whereas such measures are necessary  in certain production regions; whereas some of the said aid should therefore be allocated to the financing of such measures;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 20 (d) (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC the percentage of the production aid which may be withheld for recognized organizations of olive oil producers or associations thereof should be so fixed that the resulting  amount helps to finance the expenditure incurred in the work done pursuant to Articles 5 (3) and 20c of that Regulation; whereas that percentage should be set at a level which enables foreseeable expenditure in the 1989/90 marketing year to be covered,", "main_body": ["For the 1989/90 marketing year, the production target price, the production aid and the intervention price for olive oil shall be as follows:\n(a)  production target price: ECU 322,56 per 100 kg;\n(b)  production aid:\n- for Spain:ECU 33,36 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 28,38 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community of Ten:ECU 70,95 per 100 kg;\n(c)  production aid for growers whose average production is less than 400 kilograms of olive oil per year:\n- for Spain:ECU 36,91 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 31,93 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community of Ten:ECU 81,76 per 100 kg;\n(d)  intervention price:\n- for Spain:ECU 165,21 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 205,87 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community of Ten:ECU 216,24 per 100 kg.", "The prices specified in Article 1 shall relate to ordinary virgin olive oil with a free fatty acid content, expressed as oleic acid, of 3,3 grams per 100 grams.", "For the 1989/90 marketing year, 2 % of the production aid earmarked for olive oil producers shall be allocated to the financing of specific measures to improve the quality of olive oil in each producer Member State.", "For the 1989/90 marketing year, the percentage of the production aid which may be withheld pursuant to Article 20d (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC for organizations of olive oil producers or associations thereof recognized under the said  Regulation shall be 1,5 %.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 November 1989.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 May 1989.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
