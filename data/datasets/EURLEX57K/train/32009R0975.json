Recently additional monomers and starting substances have received a favourable scientific evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) and should now be added to the existing list.\n(2) Directive 2002/72/EC also contains a Community list of additives which may be used for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles. Recently additional additives have received a favourable scientific evaluation by the Authority and should now be added to the existing list.\n(3) Directive 2002/72/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) According to Article 4(1) of Directive 2002/72/EC, the Community list of additives contained in Annex III to that Directive will become a positive list from 1 January 2010. Consequently, the titles in Annex III to that Directive should no longer refer to an \u2018incomplete\u2019 list of additives.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III, IVa, V and VI to Directive 2002/72/EC are amended in accordance with Annexes I to V to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 October 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0338, 13.11.2004, p.\u00a04.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0220, 15.8.2002, p.\u00a018.\nANNEX I\nIn section A to Annex II to Directive 2002/72/EC the following lines are inserted in the table in numerical order:\nRef.
