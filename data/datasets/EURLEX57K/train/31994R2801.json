whereas the application must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex I to the average, expressed in value or volume terms, of each importer's imports over the reference period;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States and acceding States shows that the total applications submitted by traditional importers for the product listed in Annex II to this Regulation amount to less than the portion of the quota set  aside for them; whereas those applications should therefore be met in full;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States and acceding States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex III to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the  quota set aside for them; whereas the applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex III to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 2459/94;\nWhereas examination of the figures supplied by Member States and acceding States shows that the total applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the product listed in Annex IV to this Regulation amount to less than the portion of the quota  set aside for them; whereas those applications, up to the maximum amount that can be requested by each importer under Regulation (EC) No 2459/94, should therefore be met in full;\nWhereas, the chosen management method does not allow the allocation of economically significant quantities of the products listed in Annex V to this Regulation; whereas, consequently, it is not possible to allocate at this stage the parts of the quotas  concerned;\nWhereas in accordance with Article 169 of the Act of Accession this Regulation should enter into force on 1 January 1995, subject to the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession on the same day,", "main_body": ["In response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex I duly submitted by traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity or value equal to his average imports for  1991 and 1992 adjusted by the rate of reduction specified in the said Annex for each quota.\nWhere the use of this quantitative criterion would entail allocating an amount greater than that applied for, the quantity or value allocated shall be limited to that specified application.", "Licence applications in respect of the product in Annex II duly submitted by traditional importers shall be met in full by the competent national authorities.", "In response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex III duly submitted by non-traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity or value equal to the amount requested  within the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 2459/94, adjusted by the rate of reduction specified in the said Annex for each quota.", "Licence applications in respect of the product listed in Annex IV duly submitted by non-traditional importers shall be met in full by the competent national authorities, within the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 2459/94.", "With respect to the products listed in Annex V to this Regulation, the allocation of the quotas to non-traditional importers is suspended.", "Import licences shall be issued by the competent national authorities in the first ten working days of 1 January 1995.
