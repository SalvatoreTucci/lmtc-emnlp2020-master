In particular, Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 allows bovine animals originating in third countries and intended for on-site fattening and consumption in the French overseas departments to be imported duty free. Under Article 12(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001, customs duties are not to be levied on imports into Madeira of bovine animals originating in third countries and intended for on-site fattening and consumption in the islands. In addition, under Article 12(1)(b) of that Regulation, aid is to be granted for the supply of bovine animals originating in the Community. The minimum duration of the fattening period of animals imported or delivered under these arrangements, in particular, should be laid down.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 of 28 December 2001 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 158/2002(5), repealed Regulations (EEC) No 2312/92(6) and (EEC) No 2255/92(7) laying down detailed rules for applying the specific supply of live bovine animals to the French overseas departments and Madeira, respectively. New detailed rules for applying the scheme should therefore be laid down.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 incorrectly refers to the Combined Nomenclature code for live pure-bred breeding bovines as referred to in Annexes II and III (part 8), and should be corrected.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 provides for the supply to the Canary Islands of products falling within CN codes 1701 and 1702 in the sugar sector, with the exception of glucose and isoglucose. In cases where such supply involves sugar falling within CN codes 1701 91 00 and 1701 99 90, the method for calculating the aid applicable to such sugar should be laid down, as it is in the case of white sugar, raw sugar and sucrose syrups.\n(5) The arrangements for using certain products included in the supply balance for milk and milk products for the Canary Islands should be simplified. In addition, the aid for products falling within CN codes 1901 90 99 and 2106 90 92 should be reintroduced. For the purpose of setting the aid for supply to Madeira and the Canary Islands and in the interests of simplification, there should be a permanent reference to the Regulations fixing the export refund for similar products whenever such refunds are granted.\n(6) The CN code for breeding rabbits changed on 1 January 2002. The CN code for breeding rabbits should therefore be changed accordingly in Annex I(8) and Annex III(11). The supply to the Canary Islands of young breeding chickens weighing 2000 g or less (Annex III, part 11, CN code 0105 92 00 ) does not correspond to the real needs in the Canary Islands. Instead, grand-parents and parents of female chicks weighing less than 185 grammes (CN code ex 0105 11 ) should be supplied. Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 contains an incorrect CN code for frozen cuts of chicken (Annex III, part 11), which should be corrected.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees for beef and veal, sugar, milk and milk products, poultrymeat and eggs and fresh fruit and vegetables,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. parts 6 and 8 in Annex I are replaced by Annexes I and II to this Regulation, respectively;\n2. parts 8 and 9 in Annex II are replaced by Annexes III and IV to this Regulation, respectively;\n3. parts 6, 8, 9 and 11 in Annex III are replaced by Annexes V, VI, VII and VIII to this Regulation, respectively.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 April 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 26.\n(3) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 45.\n(4) OJ L 8, 11.1.2002, p. 15.\n(5) OJ L 25, 29.1.2002, p. 26.\n(6) OJ L 222, 7.8.1992, p. 32.\n(7) OJ L 219, 4.8.1992, p. 37.\nANNEX I\n\"Part 6\nThe beef and veal sector\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX II\n\"Part 8\nEggs, poultry, rabbits\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX III\n\"Part 8\nThe beef and veal sector\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and footnotes are defined in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1), as amended.\"\nANNEX IV\n\"Part 9\nMilk and milk products\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products\nForecast supply balance per calendar year\n>TABLE>\nCommunity aid for the supply of Community products\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX V\n\"Part 6\nSugar\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX VI\n\"Part 8\nThe beef and veal sector\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and footnotes are defined in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1), as amended.\"\nANNEX VII\n\"Part 9\nMilk and milk products\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products\nForecast supply balance per calendar year\n>TABLE>\nCommunity aid for the supply of Community products\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\"\nANNEX VIII\n\"Part 11\nEggs, poultry, rabbits\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\""}
