In this undertaking, the exporting producers in question has offered to sell the product concerned at or above price levels that eliminate the injurious effect of dumping.\n(6) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, meaning that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission. Furthermore, the sales structure of the companies is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited.\n(7) In view of this, it is considered that the undertaking is acceptable.\n(8) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the company's compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional on presentation of a commercial invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate amount of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.\n(9) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking, or a suspected breach, an anti-dumping duty may be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a08(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation,", "main_body": ["The undertaking offered by the producers mentioned in the accompanying table, in connection with the present anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia is hereby accepted.\nCountry Company TARIC additional code\nRussia Produced and sold by Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation (NLMK), 2, Metallurgov Square, Lipetsk, A674\nUSA Produced by AK Steel Corporation, 703, Curtis Street, Middletown, Ohio, A673", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5\u00a0August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a056, 6.3.1996, p.\u00a01.
