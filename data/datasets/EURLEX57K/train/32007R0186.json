That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article\u00a07(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the preparation Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) (Biosaf SC 47) as a feed additive for horses to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article\u00a07(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed. The method of analysis referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is therefore not to be understood as a Community method of analysis within the meaning of Article\u00a011 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\u00a0(2).\n(5) The use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) was authorised for cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a0316/2003 of 19\u00a0February 2003 concerning the permanent authorisation of an additive in feedingstuffs and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs\u00a0(3) for piglets (weaned), by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02148/2004 of 16\u00a0December 2004 concerning the permanent and provisional authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs and the authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs\u00a0(4) for sows, by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01288/2004 concerning the permanent authorisation of certain additives and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs\u00a0(5) for rabbits for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a0600/2005 of 18\u00a0April 2005 concerning a new authorisation for 10 years of a coccidiostat as an additive in feedingstuffs, the provisional authorisation of an additive and the permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs\u00a0(6) for dairy cows, by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01811/2005 of 4\u00a0November 2005\u00a0(7) concerning the provisional and permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs and for lambs for fattening by Commission Regulation No\u00a01447/2006 of 29\u00a0September 2006 concerning the authorisation of a new use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Biosaf SC 47) as a feed additive\u00a0(8).\n(6) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for horses. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 12\u00a0September 2006 that the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(9). It further concluded that the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) does not present any other risk for this additional animal category which would, in accordance with Article\u00a05(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is efficacious in improving fibre digestion in horses. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003. The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex .", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21\u00a0February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.
