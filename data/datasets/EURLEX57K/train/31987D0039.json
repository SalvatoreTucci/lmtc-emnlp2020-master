Objective of the programme\nDevelopment of freshwater and marine aquaculture, taking into account the suitability of species for culture in Germany, rearing techniques, commercial viability and market prospects.\n2. Duration\nThe programme will cover the period from 1 January to 31 December 1986.\n3. Areas concerned\nThe whole of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n4. Development policy\nFuture activity will be concentrated on species for which proven rearing technology exists.\nAmong these species the most important are:\n(a) trout,\n(b) carp,\n(c) eel,\n(d) marine flatfish, and in particular the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus).\n5. Production targets\nThe production targets to be achieved by the end of the programme in 1986 are the stabilization of current production of trout and carp and a significant increase in other products, eels in particular. Eel production is low at the moment (circa 10 to 20 tonnes), but there is a large unsatisfied market for eels in Germany, especially for 250-to-300-gram individuals for smoking. The production deficit is at least 500 tonnes.\n6. Investment requirements\nInvestments of about 14,3 million ECU are required for 1986. National aid to be allocated to these investments may be estimated at 4,1 million ECU.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission notes that the extension submitted by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany as a framework for future Community and national financing schemes constitutes an initial measure to guide investments in aquaculture. However, in view of the situation on the Community market for trout and carp reared exclusively in fresh water, aid will be given only to certain modernization projects. Projects leading to a reduction in pollution and/or lower mortality rates will have priority.\n2. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in the programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community."}
