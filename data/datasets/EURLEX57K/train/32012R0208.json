For that purpose, products in intervention stocks may be made available or, where intervention stocks suitable for the food distribution scheme are not available, food products may be purchased on the market. For 2012 and 2013, that scheme is included in the list of measures eligible for financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4), within an annual ceiling of EUR\u00a0500 million.\n(2) In accordance with Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 the Commission has to adopt annual plans. The annual distribution plan for 2012 was adopted on 10 June 2011 by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 562/2011\u00a0(5) solely on the basis of products available in intervention stocks. The additional resources made available on the 2012 budget year for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, as a result of the amendment of Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 by Regulation (EU) No 121/2012, should be allocated to the Member States.\n(3) In order to enforce the annual budgetary ceiling, the intra-Union transfer costs, where relevant, should be included into the total financial allocation made available for each Member State to implement the 2012 distribution plan. Moreover, the deadlines fixed by Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 of 14 September 2010 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Union\u00a0(6) for the requests for payment and the execution of payments by the competent authorities should be adjusted, in order to ensure that the resources allocated within the 2012 distribution plan are only eligible for Union support if those payments are made in the 2012 budget year.\n(4) Taking into account the shortened time-frame left to the Member States for the implementation of the 2012 distribution plan as a consequence of the date of entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 121/2012, it is appropriate to grant an extension of the deadlines provided for in Article 3(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 as regards the implementation period of the annual plan and the completion of the payment operations for products mobilised on the market.\n(5) That revision of the distribution plan for 2012 being made at a time when national administrative arrangements for the implementation of the plan should be approaching completion, the quantities of products available in intervention stocks which are reallocated following the decision of Finland to renounce to a part of its allocation of skimmed milk powder or to reassessment of the exact quantities in intervention storage should not be taken into account for calculating whether Member States have respected the obligation laid down in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 to have withdrawn 70\u00a0% of cereals and skimmed milk powder by the deadlines fixed in that Article.\n(6) In view of the fact that the implementation period of the 2012 distribution plan is already advanced and to allow Member States as much time as possible to proceed to the actions needed for the implementation of the amended plan, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 562/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 562/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Articles 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n(2) the following Articles 2a to 2d are inserted:\n(a) 5,46 tonnes of cereals stored in the United Kingdom and allocated to Bulgaria;\n(b) 0,651 tonne
