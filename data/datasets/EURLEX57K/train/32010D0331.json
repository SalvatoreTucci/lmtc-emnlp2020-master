In that report it came to the conclusion that an additional assessment was required.\n(3) The Commission informed all Member States about the request on 27 November 2006. EFSA was requested to carry out the assessment on 22 December 2006.\n(4) On 26 November 2009 following a request from the Commission, the Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted an opinion on the safety of Ferric Sodium EDTA. In the opinion EFSA concluded that EDTA is of no safety concern as long as the intake of EDTA does not exceed 1,9\u00a0mg EDTA per kg bodyweight per day.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 953/2009 of 13 October 2009 on substances that may be added for specific nutritional purposes in foods for particular nutritional uses\u00a0(2), Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements\u00a0(3) and/or Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods\u00a0(4) lay down specific provision for the use of vitamins, minerals and other substances in food. The use of Ferric Sodium EDTA should be authorised without prejudice to the requirements of this legislation. The limits set in Annex II of this Decision relate exclusively to EDTA as such and are without prejudice to any limits for the addition of iron to foods. On the basis of the scientific assessment it is established that Ferric Sodium EDTA complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(6) In order to ensure that children will not exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of EDTA it appears appropriate to set limits for the addition of EDTA to foods.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Ferric Sodium EDTA as a source of iron as specified in the Annex I may be placed on the market in the Union as a novel food ingredient to be used in food without prejudice to the specific provisions of Regulation (EC) No 953/2009, Directive 2002/46/EC and/or Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006.\nThe maximum amount of Ferric Sodium EDTA (expressed as anhydrous EDTA) to be used in foods is set out in Annex II.", "The designation of the novel food ingredient authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuff containing it shall be \u2018Ferric Sodium EDTA\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH, Kreuzauer Strasse 46, D \u2014 52355 D\u00fcren."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a043, 14.2.1997, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0269, 14.10.2009, p.\u00a09.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0183, 12.7.2002, p.\u00a051.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0404, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a026.\nANNEX I\nSpecifications of Ferric Sodium EDTA\nDESCRIPTION\nFerric Sodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is an odourless free-flowing, yellow to brown powder with a chemical purity of more than 99\u00a0% (w/w).
