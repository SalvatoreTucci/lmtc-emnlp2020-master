Mr Monie Captan\nMinister of Foreign Affairs\nLiberia\nDear Minister,\nThe European Union is deeply concerned about the prevailing security situation in your country and wishes to assist in returning peace and stability. It has therefore the intention to provide financial support to a peacekeeping operation in Liberia. The European Union also wishes to make funds available for other measures to accompany the peace process once a comprehensive peace agreement has been reached and signed.\nThe Community has therefore decided to replace the measures as outlined in its letter No SGS 272745 of 27 March 2002 with the following new measures, motivated by a case of special urgency within the meaning of Article 96(2)(b) of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, as regards the implementation of its aid:\n- regular follow-up will be ensured by means of a close political dialogue involving the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission, and six-monthly political reviews,\n- implementation of current projects funded under Article 72 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, amounting at the moment to EUR 25 million and intended to meet the needs of displaced persons, will be continued,\n- contributions to regional projects, operations of a humanitarian nature, trade cooperation and trade-related preferences are not affected,\n- institution support to allow for the implementation of the measures aimed at fulfilling undertakings given within the consultations can be provided,\n- Chapter 1 of Annex 4 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is suspended. The balances remaining for Liberia from the 8th EDF shall be available forthwith for implementation. The funds shall cover support to the peace process in Liberia that could include support to a peacekeeping operation in Liberia, a demobilisation and reintegration programme, institution building and restoring efficient democratic structures,\n- notification of the 9th EDF allocation will be made once the comprehensive peace agreement is in force and the signatory parties to the agreement have shown commitment to implement the agreement as foreseen. The decision to notify will be made following a six-monthly political review as set out in the first indent. The suspension of Chapter 1 of Annex 4 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement as set out in the preceding indent will not apply to the implementation of the 9th EDF allocation,\n- the Commission will continue to exercise the function of national authorising officer on behalf of the latter for the implementation of the balances remaining from the 8th EDF as provided for above.\nThe European Union will continue to follow closely the situation in Liberia. We propose that our intensive political dialogue should continue, on the basis of Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and on the basis of the outcome of the consultations as set out in our letter No SGS 272745 of 27 March 2002.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
