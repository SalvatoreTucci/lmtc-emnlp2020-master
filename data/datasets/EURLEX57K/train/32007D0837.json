45.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 144, 6.6.2007, p. 22.\nANNEX\nThe strategic guidelines set out below are to be seen in the context of more efficient management of migration flows at all stages, as initiated by the Tampere European Council in 1999, including a common return policy and the fight against illegal immigration.\nWhen preparing their draft multi-annual programmes, Member States should target the available resources under this Fund to three out of four of the following priorities, allowing them to determine the most effective distribution of the financial resources allocated to them in accordance with their needs:\nPRIORITY 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for the development of a strategic approach to return management by Member States.\nThis includes the development of integrated return management in all its dimensions. In accordance with Article 3(2) of Decision No 575/2007/EC, integrated return management should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the situation of the potential returnees in the Member State and in their countries of origin and the challenges with respect to the operations envisaged, set targets for such operations and envisage a wide set of measures focusing on effective and sustainable return, including preparation, enforcement and follow-up of removals.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for integrated return plans addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) assisted voluntary return programmes;\n(2) cash incentives and measures to address the specific situation of vulnerable returnees;\n(3) integrated return plans supporting the return of third-country nationals or stateless persons not covered under Community readmission agreements or national bilateral readmission agreements to countries of origin, former residence or transit with which cooperation in the field of return is particularly difficult.\nPRIORITY 2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for the cooperation between Member States in return management.\nThis includes setting up and implementing integrated return plans as well as cooperation in specific areas of integrated return management, such as the preparation, enforcement and follow-up of joint flights for removal and joint removals by land.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priority:\n\u2014 integrated return plans which have been designed and will also be implemented in cooperation with other Member States, and, where appropriate, with the Frontex Agency, non-governmental organisations and/or international organisations, with the aim of pooling the different skills, experiences and resources of the authorities of the Member States and where appropriate the other organisations involved.\nPRIORITY 3:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for specific innovative (inter)national tools for return management.\nThis includes setting up or improving counselling and return information measures, reintegration measures for returnees in the country of return, modes of cooperation with consular and/or immigration services, including training, and measures to gain information on undocumented third-country nationals or stateless persons.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) projects which propose particularly innovative ways and means of informing and counselling potential returnees about the situation in the countries of return and/or other innovative incentives for increasing the number of voluntary returnees based on respect for the dignity of the individuals concerned;\n(2) projects which test new working methods to speed up the process of documenting returnees in cooperation with the consular authorities and immigration services of third countries.\nPRIORITY 4:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for Community standards and best practices on return management.\nThis includes the application of existing and future common standards as referred to in recitals 13 and 14 of Decision No 575/2007/EC and the promotion of (inter)national best practices and ways to cooperate with the relevant authorities of other Member States, for example by using the ICONET.\nWithin this priority, the Community contribution may be increased to 75\u00a0% for projects addressing the following specific priorities:\n(1) evaluations and missions to measure progress in return programmes, tools and processes;\n(2) measures taken at national level to ensure a fair and effective implementation of common standards on return, as established under Community legislation on return, including the training of practitioners."}
