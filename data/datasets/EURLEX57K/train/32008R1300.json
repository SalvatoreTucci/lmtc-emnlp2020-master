It is therefore appropriate that the Council should reserve the right to exercise implementing powers directly with respect to these specific matters,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS", "Subject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a multi-annual plan for the fisheries exploiting the stock of herring (Clupea harengus) in international and Community waters of ICES\u00a0zones Vb and VIb, and that part of ICES zone VIa which lies west of the meridian of longitude 7o W and north of the parallel of latitude 55o N, or east of the meridian of longitude 7o W and north of the parallel of latitude\u00a056o N, excluding the Clyde (hereinafter together referred to as the area west of Scotland).", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions laid down in Article 3 of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No 2371/2002 shall apply.
