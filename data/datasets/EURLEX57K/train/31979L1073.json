On a horizontal support level with the reference point, there must be mounted two point sources of light, e.g. 2 \u0102\u0097 150 W, 12 V, 65 mm apart and symmetrically located with respect to the reference point. The support must be rotatable at its centre point about a vertical axis passing through the reference point. For the purpose of measuring the masking effects, the support must be so aligned that the line joining the two light sources is perpendicular to the line joining the masking component and the reference point.\nThe silhouette (deepest shadow) overlaps projected on to the semi-circle of vision by the masking component when the light sources are switched on simultaneously or alternately must be measured in accordance with 1.4 (Figure 3).\n2.2.1.2 to read as follows:\nMasking effects must not exceed 700 mm.\n2.2.1.3 to read as follows:\nMasking effects due to adjacent structural components over 80 mm in width must be so configured that there is an interval of not less than 2 200 mm - measured as a chord of the semi-circle of vision - between the centres of two masking effects.\n2.2.1.5 to read as follows:\nOutside the sector of vision, masking effects exceeding 700 mm but not exceeding 1 500 mm are, however, permissible if the components causing them cannot be redesigned or relocated : on each side there may be a total of either two such masking effects, one not exceeding 700 mm and the other not exceeding 1 500 mm, or two such masking effects, neither exceeding 1 200 mm.\n2.2.2.1 to read as follow:\nAs an alternative to the procedure set out in 2.2.1, the acceptability of individual masking effects can be determined mathematically. The requirements of 2.2.1.2, 2.2.1.3, 2.2.1.4, 2.2.1.5 and 2.2.1.6 shall apply in respect of the size, distribution and number of the masking effects.\n2.5 to read as follows:\nFor the purpose of determining the masking effects in the sector of vision, the masking effects due to the frame of the windscreen and to any other obstacle may, in accordance with the provisions of 2.2.1.4, be considered as a single effect, provided that the distance between the outermost points of this masking effect does not exceed 700 mm.\nFor Figure 2, the drawing is replaced by the following drawing: >PIC FILE= \"T0015652\">"}
