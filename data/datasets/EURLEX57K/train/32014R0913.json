The limited storage possibility for those perishable fruits does not allow for a rapid improvement in such a situation. Furthermore, the ban announced by Russia on imports of fruits and vegetables from the Union to Russia risks to aggravate the situation in the peach and nectarine markets. Accordingly, a situation has arisen on the market which the normal measures available under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 appear to be insufficient to address.\n(2) In order to prevent the existing market situation from turning into a more severe or prolonged market disturbance, urgent action is needed to provide for exceptional support measures for producers of peaches and nectarines at this stage of the harvest.\n(3) Market withdrawals are an effective crisis management measure in case of surplus of fruit and vegetables due to temporary and unpredictable circumstances.\n(4) In order to mitigate the impact of a sudden drop in prices this summer, the existing Union financial assistance for market withdrawals to be freely distributed to certain organisations, such as charitable organisations and schools, should be temporarily increased. Union financial assistance should therefore be granted up to a maximum of 10 % of the volume of marketed production of each producer organisation.\n(5) In the light of the exceptional market disturbances and in in order to ensure that all producers of peaches and nectarines are supported by the Union, Union financial assistance should be extended to producers of peaches and nectarines who are not members of a recognised producer organisation.\n(6) Producers who are not members of a producer organisation should receive 50 % of the amounts provided for under the existing Union financial assistance. However, they should fulfil the same or similar conditions as producer organisations. Therefore, in this context, they should be subject, like recognised producer organisations,\u00a0to the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0543/2011\u00a0(2).\n(7) Moreover, increased consumption of peaches and nectarines should help to stabilise the market situation more rapidly. Promotion campaigns should be used to encourage consumption. Therefore, additional Union support should be given to producer organisations as regards promotion campaigns.\n(8) That additional support for promotion activities should be distributed between the Member States on the basis of their production of peaches and nectarines in 2012. Most production is concentrated in four Member States. Twenty-four Member States together account for only 3,7 % of the Union production of peaches and nectarines. In order to ensure an efficient use of the available budget, no allocation should be granted to Member States with a share of the Union production below 1 %.\n(9) It should be left to the Member States concerned to determine how they will allocate the additional support provided for in this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011, except where derogations to those Regulations are provided in this Regulation.\n(10) In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, the temporary exceptional support measures provided for in this Regulation should apply as of the date of the announcement of those measures by the Commission on 11 August 2014,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down rules for temporary exceptional support measures for peaches and nectarines of CN\u00a0code 0809\u00a030 intended for fresh consumption.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The support measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover:\n(a) withdrawal operations carried out from 11 August until 30 September 2014 by producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector recognised in accordance with Article 154 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as well as by producers who are not members of such organisations; and\n(b) promotion activities as referred to in Article 33(3)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 carried out from 11 August until 31 December 2014 by producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector recognised in accordance with Article 154 of that Regulation.", "Financial assistance to producer organisations for withdrawals\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the withdrawal operations referred to in Article 1(2)(a), Union financial assistance for market withdrawals for free distribution under Article 34(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall be available for a maximum of 10 % of the volume of marketed production of each producer organisation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Union financial assistance referred to in paragraph 1 shall be available to producer organisations even if they do not provide for such market withdrawal operations in their operational programmes.
