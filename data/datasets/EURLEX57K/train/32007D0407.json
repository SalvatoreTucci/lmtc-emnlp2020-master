Evidence shows that the amount and pattern of non-human usage of antimicrobials affect the occurrence of resistant bacteria in animals and food and thereby human exposure to these resistant bacteria (Joint FAO/OIE/WHO Expert Workshop, 2003). However, it should be noted that most of the resistance problems in human medicine are caused by human usage and over usage of antimicrobial agents for therapy and prophylaxis (European Parliament, October 2006).\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicates in its \u2018Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents, Antimicrobial Resistance and Foodborne Outbreaks in the European Union in 2005\u2019\u00a0(2) that a relatively high proportion of Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates from animals and food were resistant to antimicrobials commonly used in treatment of human diseases. Food-borne infections caused by these resistant bacteria pose a particular risk to humans due to possible treatment failure.\n(4) The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards and of the Scientific Panel an Animal Health and Welfare of the EFSA, adopted an Opinion on \u2018Review of the Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Antimicrobial Resistance in the European Union in 2004\u2019\u00a0(3) during its meeting on respectively 7 and 8 September 2006. With regard to antimicrobial resistance testing, the Opinion indicates the importance to provide detailed information on the Salmonella serovar for each isolate and to harmonise the breakpoints applied for resistance assessment and reporting.\n(5) The Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection of the EFSA adopted a \u2018Report including a proposal for a harmonised monitoring scheme of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella in fowl (Gallus gallus), turkeys and pigs and Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli in broilers\u2019\u00a0(4) on 20 February 2007. The report makes recommendations on a harmonised monitoring scheme and harmonised methodology for susceptibility testing.\n(6) In view of the increasing public health risk posed by antimicrobial resistance and the evidence that use of antibiotics affects this risk, comparable information should be collected from all Member States on the antimicrobial resistance occurrence in zoonotic agents in animals by implementing Article 7 of Directive 2003/99/EC. This implementation should be based on the proposal of the EFSA Task Force but is without prejudice to further implementation rules in the future.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Decision lays down detailed rules for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in accordance with Article 7(3) and Annex II(B) of Directive 2003/99/EC to be carried out in the Member States.
