Both national accounting legislation and international standards have changed since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13). Directive 86/635/EEC has been amended to the effect that certain financial instruments may be valued at fair value. International accounting standards may also provide for the valuation of certain financial instruments at fair value.\n(3) For the purposes of the statistical information which the European Central Bank (ECB) needs to fulfil its tasks, deposit liabilities and loans have to be reported at their nominal value.\n(4) In light of the above, it has become necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) to include an explicit requirement regarding the reporting of deposit liabilities and loans at nominal value.\n(5) At the same time, given the current stage in the process of harmonisation in the field of statistics that has been reached as a result of Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13), it is desirable to continue to apply the valuation rules that have until now been applied to provisioned loans and purchased loans. Therefore, national central banks may allow existing valuation rules to apply to such loans until the ECB updates these rules in order to harmonise reporting further.\n(6) In view of the possibility that some MFIs may value debt securities issued at fair value, it is necessary to clarify the scope of the reporting of the \u2018other revaluation\u2019 adjustments in respect of price revaluation of securities.\n(7) As a consequence of the above, Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 (ECB/2001/18) of the European Central Bank of 20 December 2001 concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions to deposits and loans vis-\u00e0-vis households and non-financial corporations\u00a0(4), should also be amended,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) is amended as follows:\nAnnex I is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 (ECB/2001/18) is amended as follows:\nAnnex II is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2005."], "attachments": "Done at Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2004.\nFor the Governing Council of the ECB\nThe President of the ECB\nJean-Claude TRICHET\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 318, 27.11.1998, p. 8.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 333, 17.12.2001, p. 1.

Deposit liabilities and loans are reported, for the purposes of this Regulation, at the nominal amount outstanding at the end of the month and on a gross basis. Nominal amount means the amount of principal that a debtor is contractually obliged to repay to a creditor.\n16. NCBs may allow the reporting of provisioned loans net of provisions and the reporting of purchased loans at the price agreed at the time of their acquisition, provided that such reporting practices are applied by all resident reporting agents and are necessary to maintain continuity in the statistical valuation of loans with the data reported for periods prior to January 2005.\u2019;\n3. in part 1, section IV the following paragraph 10 is added:\n10. Deposit liabilities and loans are reported according to the rules set out for monthly stocks in paragraphs 15 and 16 of section III.\u2019;\n4. paragraph 11 of part 1, section V is replaced by the following:\n\u201811. The adjustment in respect of the price revaluation of securities refers to fluctuations in the valuation of securities that arise because of a change in the price at which securities are recorded or traded. The adjustment includes the changes that occur over time in the value of end-period balance sheet stocks because of changes in the reference value at which securities are recorded, i.e. potential gains/losses. It may also contain valuation changes that arise from transactions in securities i.e. realised gains/losses.\u2019;\n5. paragraph 12 of Part 1, Section V is replaced by the following:\n\u201812. No minimum reporting requirement is established for the liability side of the balance sheet. However, if valuation practices applied by reporting agents to debt securities issued result in changes to their end-period stocks, NCBs are permitted to collect data relating to such changes. Such data are reported as \u201cother revaluation\u201d adjustments.\u2019;\n6. the table entitled \u2018Detailed description of instrument categories of the monthly aggregated balance sheet of the MFI sector\u2019 in part 3 is amended as follows:\n(a) the fourth indent of point 7 (Remaining assets) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 accrued interest receivable on loans\n(b) the fourth indent of point 13 (Remaining liabilities) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 accrued interest payable on deposits\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 372, 31.12.1986, p. 1.\nANNEX II\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 (ECB/2001/18) is amended as follows:\nParagraph 42 of part 4, section XIII is replaced by the following:\n\u201842.
