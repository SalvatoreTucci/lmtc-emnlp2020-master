That position is also that of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as far as in vivo derived embryos are concerned. Nevertheless, in the interests of animal health, appropriate safeguards should be taken upstream with regard to semen used for fertilisation, in particular with respect to in vitro generated embryos.\n(7) Community requirements for imports of bovine embryos derived by natural (in vivo) fertilisation and produced by in vitro fertilisation, in particular as regards semen used for fertilisation, should therefore be adapted.\n(8) In the light of the risk assessment carried out by the IETS and in line with the recommendations of the OIE, the conditions governing imports of in vivo derived bovine embryos should be simplified while stricter animal health requirements should be maintained for imports of in vitro produced embryos, with special restrictions where the zona pellucida has been damaged during the process.\n(9) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Decision 2005/217/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n(10) However, in order to enable economic operators to adapt to the new requirements set out in this Decision it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period whereby imports of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species collected or produced before 1 January 2006 may, subject to certain conditions, be imported into the Community according to the requirements set out in Annex V to this Decision.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["General conditions for imports of embryos\nMember States shall authorise imports of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species (embryos) collected or produced in a third country listed in Annex I to this Decision by approved embryo collection or production teams listed in the Annex to Decision 92/452/EEC.", "Imports of in vivo derived embryos\nMember States shall authorise imports of embryos derived by in vivo fertilisation and complying with the animal health requirements set out in the model veterinary certificate in Annex II.", "Imports of in vitro produced embryos\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall authorise imports of embryos which are produced by in vitro fertilisation using semen complying with Directive 88/407/EEC and which meet the animal health requirements set out in the model veterinary certificate in Annex III to this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall authorise imports of embryos which are produced by in vitro fertilisation using semen produced in approved semen collection centres or stored in semen storage centres in third countries listed in Annex I to Commission Decision 2004/639/EC\u00a0(6) and which comply with the animal health requirements set out in the model veterinary certificate in Annex IV to this Decision on condition that such embryos are:\n(a) excluded from intra-Community trade; and\n(b) implanted exclusively into female bovine animals present in the Member State of destination indicated in the veterinary certificate.", "Transitional measures\nBy way of derogation from Articles 2 and 3, Member States shall authorise, until 31 December 2006, the importation of embryos from the third countries listed in Annex I provided that such embryos comply with:\n(a) the animal health requirements set out in the model veterinary certificate in Annex V; and\n(b) the following conditions:\n(i) they must be collected or produced before 1 January 2006;\n(ii) they must only be used for implantation into female bovine animals present in the Member State of destination indicated in the veterinary certificate;\n(iii) they must be excluded from intra-Community trade;\n(iv) they must be accompanied by such a certificate duly completed before 1 January 2007.", "Repeal\nDecision 2005/217/EC is repealed.", "Applicability\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January 2006.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1989, p. 1.
