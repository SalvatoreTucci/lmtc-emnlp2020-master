Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(12).\n(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018micro-organisms\u2019 as set out in Annex I is authorised for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018enzymes\u2019 as set out in Annexes II, III, IV, V and VI are authorised for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in those Annexes.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States"], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 265, 3.10.2002, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 27.7.1999, p. 17.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 7.7.1998, p. 15.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 130, 12.5.2001, p. 25.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 79, 30.3.2000, p. 26.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 108, 27.4.1999, p. 21.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 7.7.1998, p. 15.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 28.6.2000, p. 15.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 333, 10.12.2002, p. 5.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nEC No Additive Chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff\nMicro-organisms\nE\u00a01707 Enterococcus faecium Preparation of Enterococcus faecium containing a minimum of:\npowder and granulated form:\ncoated form:\nliquid form:\nANNEX II\nEC No Additive Chemical formula, description Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff\nEnzymes\nE\u00a01602 Preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74 252) having a minimum activity of:\nEndo-1,4-beta-glucanase\nEndo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase\nEndo-1,4-beta-xylanase\nEndo-1,4-beta-glucanase:\nEndo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase:\nEndo-1,4-beta-xylanase:\n1.
