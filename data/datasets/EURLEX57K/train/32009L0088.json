It is therefore appropriate to include thiacloprid in Annex I.\n(5) However, unacceptable risks were identified for the in situ treatment of wooden structures near water, where direct losses to the aquatic compartment cannot be prevented. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.\n(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Community level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Community level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to mitigate the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n(7) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing thiacloprid and used as wood preservatives to ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC and Annex VI thereto. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks to these compartments have been identified during the evaluation. Products intended for industrial and/or professional use should be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for industrial and/or professional users cannot be reduced by other means.\n(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\n(9) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The Standing Committee on Biocidal Products was consulted on 30 May 2008 and delivered a positive opinion on the draft Commission Directive amending Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC to include thiacloprid as an active substance. On 11 June 2008 the Commission submitted the said draft for scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council. The European Parliament did not oppose the draft measures within the set deadline. The Council opposed the adoption by the Commission indicating that the proposed measures exceeded the implementing powers provided for in Directive 98/8/EC. As a consequence, the Commission did not adopt the draft measures and submitted an amended draft of the concerned Directive to the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products. The Standing Committee was consulted on the said draft on 20 February 2009.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 6 months after its entry into force.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

In view of the assumptions made during the risk assessment, products authorised for industrial and/or professional use, must be used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to industrial and/or professional users can be reduced to an acceptable level by other means.\n2. In view of the risks identified for the soil and aquatic compartments appropriate risk mitigation measures must be taken to protect those compartments. In particular, labels and/or safety-data sheets of products authorised for industrial use shall indicate that freshly treated timber must be stored after treatment under shelter and/or on impermeable hard standing to prevent direct losses to soil or water and that any losses must be collected for reuse or disposal.\n3. Products shall not be authorised for the in situ treatment of wooden structures near water, where direct losses to the aquatic compartment cannot be prevented, or for wood that will be in contact with surface water, unless data have been submitted to demonstrate that the product will meet the requirements of Article 5 and Annex VI, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0For the implementation of the common principles of Annex VI, the content and conclusions of assessment reports are available on the Commission website: http://ec.europa.eu/comm/environment/biocides/index.htm"}
