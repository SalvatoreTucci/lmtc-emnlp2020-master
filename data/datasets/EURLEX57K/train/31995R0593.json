Until 31 December 1995, coupage of a wine suitable for yielding a white table wine or of a white table wine with a wine suitable for yielding a red table wine or with a red table wine shall be permitted on Spanish territory provided that the product obtained has the characteristics of a red table wine and that the percentage of red wine used is not less than 75 %.\n2. Until the date in paragraph 1, coupage in the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 of Spanish wine other than white table wine with wine from other Member States shall be prohibited.\n3. Spanish red and ros\u00e9 table wines may only be the subject of trade with the other Member States or be exported to third countries if they are not obtained from coupage as referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.
