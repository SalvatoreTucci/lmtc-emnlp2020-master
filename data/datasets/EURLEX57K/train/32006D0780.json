If, in the case of indirect reductions or limitations, the quantity of reductions in individual installations falling under the Community emissions trading scheme cannot be identified exactly, the quantity of reductions or limitations within the total reductions or limitations of the project activity that would cause double counting should be estimated.\n(7) The Community emissions trading scheme requires Member States to notify to the Commission the total quantity of allowances intended to be allocated for the 2008-2012 period in their national allocation plans 18 months in advance of the start of the period. The precise amount of emission reductions or limitations generated by a particular project activity is, however, established annually after these have taken place.\n(8) A set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State hosting activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing each approved project activity and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (\u2018trading sector project-reductions\u2019). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of \u2018trading sector project-reductions\u2019 anticipated for each project activity being hosted by the Member State.\n(9) Another set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State intending to host activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing planned project activities and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (\u2018trading sector project-reductions\u2019). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of \u2018trading sector project-reductions\u2019 anticipated for planned project activities to be hosted by the Member State.\n(10) ERUs or CERs that represent \u2018trading sector project-reductions\u2019 may be issued up until 31 December 2012. Each such issuance should be notified to the Commission.\n(11) In their national allocation plans, Member States hosting, or intending to host, activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting should indicate the projected emissions for activities falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC both with and without the effects of the anticipated trading sector project-reductions.\n(12) Member States should take into consideration any anticipated reductions or limitations caused by project activities that affect an installation or activity and would cause double counting when establishing their national allocation plan methodology for determining the allocation of individual installations.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["This Decision lays down provisions for the implementation of Article 11b(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.", "For the purposes of this Decision, and in addition to the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2216/2004\u00a0(2), the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018direct emission reduction or limitation\u2019 means a reduction or limitation of emissions occurring due to a project activity which causes reductions or limitations of emissions in installations that are individually identified in the project activity\u2019s baseline established pursuant to Article 1 of Appendix B to Decision 16/CP.7 of the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or pursuant to Article 44 of the Annex to Decision 17/CP.7 of the UNFCCC;\n2. \u2018indirect emission reduction or limitation\u2019 means any reductions or limitations of emissions in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC that is not a direct emission reduction or limitation;\n3. \u2018trading sector project-reduction\u2019 means a reduction or limitation in emissions of installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC due to project activities for which a Member State hosting the project activity issues emission reduction units (ERUs) or certified emission reductions CERs;\n4. \u2018letter of approval\u2019 means, in the case of project activities that generate ERUs, a binding obligation undertaken in a written form by the Member State hosting the project activity to issue ERUs in accordance with the Member State\u2019s national guidelines and procedures for approving project activities as referred to in Article 20 (a) of the Annex to Decision 16/CP.7 of the UNFCCC; and in the case of project activities that generate CERs, a written approval of voluntary participation from the designated national authority of the Member State hosting the project activity as referred to in Article 40(a) of the Annex to Decision 17/CP.7 of the UNFCCC;\n5. \u2018letter of endorsement\u2019 means an official communication in a written form by the Member State to host the project activity that it considers the project as one with a potential to gain eventual approval as a project activity.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012, a Member State shall include in the total quantity of allowances a set-aside of allowances drawn up for each project activity in the format set out in the table in Annex I to this Decision if, prior to the deadline for the notification of its national allocation plan set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Member State has issued letters of approval as a host country, pledging to issue ERUs or CERs for project activities which result in emission reductions or limitations in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012, a Member State may also include in the total quantity of allowances an additional set-aside of allowances drawn up in the format set out in the Annex II to this Decision if after the decision pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC it intends to issue letters of approval as a host country that pledge to issue ERUs or CERs before 31 December 2012 for project activities which result in emission reductions or limitations in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.
