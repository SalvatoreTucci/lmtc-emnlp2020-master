For that purpose, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof (countries or regions) is to be determined by classification into one of three categories depending on the BSE risk involved, namely a negligible BSE risk, a controlled BSE risk and an undetermined BSE risk.\n(2) The Annex to Commission Decision 2007/453/EC of 29 June 2007 establishing the BSE status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof according to their BSE risk\u00a0(2) lists countries or regions according to their BSE risk status.\n(3) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) plays a leading role in the categorisation of countries or regions according to their BSE risk. The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC takes account of Resolution No XXI \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Status of Members \u2014 adopted by the OIE in May 2008 regarding the BSE status of Member States and third countries.\n(4) Decision 2007/453/EC currently lists Finland and Sweden as having a negligible BSE risk and all other Member States as having a controlled BSE risk. It also lists the BSE status of third countries. In May 2009, the OIE adopted Resolution No XXII \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Members. That Resolution recognised Chile as having a negligible BSE risk and Colombia and Japan as having a controlled BSE risk. The list in Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended to be brought into line with that Resolution as regards those three third countries. However, pending a final conclusion of the OIE on the BSE risk status of all Member States and taking into account the harmonised stringent BSE protective measures applied within the Community, no changes should at present be made as regards the recognised BSE status of the Member States.\n(5) Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 84.\nANNEX\n\u2018LIST OF COUNTRIES OR REGIONS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a negligible BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Finland,\n\u2014 Sweden,\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Iceland,\n\u2014 Norway,\nThird countries\n\u2014 Argentina,\n\u2014 Australia,\n\u2014 Chile,\n\u2014 New Zealand,\n\u2014 Paraguay,\n\u2014 Singapore,\n\u2014 Uruguay,\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a controlled BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, United Kingdom,\nEFTA countries\n\u2014 Liechtenstein,\n\u2014 Switzerland,\nThird countries\n\u2014 Brazil,\n\u2014 Canada,\n\u2014 Colombia,\n\u2014 Japan,\n\u2014 Mexico,\n\u2014 Taiwan,\n\u2014 United States,\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with an undetermined BSE risk\n\u2014 Countries or regions not listed in points A or B of this Annex.\u2019"}
