The references to those quotas and reference quantities should therefore be deleted.\n(7) Since the Protocol to the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 May 2004, this Regulation should apply from the same date and should enter into force as soon as possible.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
