Those Protocols should be applied with effect from 1 January 2002.\n(2) In Annex I to each of those Additional Protocols on wine, individual tariff quotas are granted in respect of imports into the Community of certain wines originating in the Republic of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Slovenia. These individual tariff quotas are provided out of the global tariff quota of 545000 hl opened within Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000(7).\n(3) The individual tariff quotas provided for in the Additional Protocols on wine are annual and are repeated for an indeterminate period. Therefore the Commission should adopt the implementing measures for the opening and the administration of those Community tariff quotas.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2001(9), has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.\n(5) Particular care should be taken to ensure that all Community importers have equal and continuous access to the tariff quotas and that the rates laid down for the quotas are applied uninterruptedly to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted.\n(6) In order to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, Member States should be authorised to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly. For reasons of speed and efficiency, communication between the Member States and the Commission should, as far as possible, take place by telematic link.\n(7) The benefit from the exemption of customs duty within the tariff quotas provided for in the Additional Protocols on wine should be suspended for the Republic of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or the Republic of Slovenia if any of these countries pays export subsidies for the products in question.\n(8) Entitlement to benefit from individual Community tariff quotas should be subject to the presentation of a V I 1 document or a V I 2 extract in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 of 24 April 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards trade with third countries in products in the wine sector(10).\n(9) The individual tariff quotas for certain wines originating in the Republic of Croatia and in the Republic of Slovenia should be progressively increased subject to specific conditions indicated in the Additional Protocols on wine. In particular, the annual increase may be applied only if at least 80 % of the individual tariff quotas opened within the previous year has been used. Consequently, the Commission should review the volumes used each year and should adopt provisions to implement any necessary adjustment of those volumes for Croatia or Slovenia.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["1. When wines, listed in the Annex, originating in the Republic of Croatia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or in the Republic of Slovenia are put into free circulation in the Community, they shall benefit from an exemption of customs duty, within the limits of the annual Community tariff quotas specified in this Annex and in accordance with the provisions set out in this Regulation.\n2.
