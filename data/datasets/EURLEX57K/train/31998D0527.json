The value of theoretical VAT receipts;\n2. The discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the period.\nCalculation of theoretical VAT receipts\nThe theoretical VAT receipts are the amounts of VAT which would be collected if all units subject to VAT were to pay it as required by law.\nIn order to calculate theoretical VAT receipts, the first step is to bring the VAT base into line with current legislation: in other words, to identify all the transactions which are subject to non-deductible VAT. Final household consumption is treated as wholly subject to non-deductible VAT, whereas other categories of uses have to be broken down in order to determine a rate of non-deductibility. This calculation is made using the most highly disaggregated national accounts data available. The VAT base is calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\nThe second step is to apply the appropriate rate of VAT to each transaction constituting the VAT base as defined in the previous paragraph. The VAT rates applied must be those in force during the year for which the VAT base has been calculated. Theoretical VAT receipts are calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\nCalculation of the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the reference period\nThe discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts (calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules) and actual VAT receipts comprises four components:\n1. Time differences between treasury data and national accounts data;\n2. Ad hoc cancellations by the tax authorities of certain VAT claims in cases of insolvency;\n3. Evasion involving the buyers' connivance (with complicity) (cases where the buyer does not pay VAT to the seller);\n4. Evasion not involving the buyers' connivance (without complicity) (cases where the buyer pays VAT to the seller, but the latter fails to remit it to the tax authorities).\nAs a result, the value of evasion 'without complicity` is arrived at by deducting evasion 'with complicity` and insolvency-related cancellations from the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts, taking into account time differences between the transaction giving rise to the VAT and the collection of VAT receipts by the tax authorities.\nEvasion 'without complicity` = Theoretical VAT receipts less actual VAT receipts less time differences less insolvencies less missing receipts (evasion 'with complicity`)\nActual VAT receipts are the amounts actually collected by the tax authorities during the period to which the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts relates.\nAdjustments for time differences are intended to correct receipts so as to allow for the fact that some payments of VAT made in the current year (n) relate to the previous year (n-1) and that some VAT payable in respect of year n is not actually collected until the following year (n+1).\nThere may be instances where current legislation entitles the tax authorities to make ad hoc cancellations of VAT claims in cases of insolvency. In such cases, the value of the cancellations must be deducted from the difference between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts (unless it has already been taken into account in the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts).\nIn order to calculate the value of evasion 'with complicity`, only those activities should be taken into account in respect of which an adjustment for undeclared work (non-recording in statistical files of economically active units) has been made.\nBy using this method, applying the adjustments for undeclared work previously made to the output of branches of economic activity and multiplying the corresponding amounts for additional sales (undeclared sales) by the appropriate rates of VAT, it is possible to estimate the value of 'missing` VAT receipts which the tax authorities have been denied because of VAT evasion 'with complicity`.\nBy way of example: if, following an adjustment for undeclared work, the estimate of the household consumption of a given product, excluding VAT, is increased by 15 %, and if the rate of VAT applying to purchases of that product is 18,6 %, the amount owing to the tax authorities can be calculated as follows:\nMissing VAT receipts due to evasion 'with complicity` = value of sales of the product before adjustment \u0102\u0097 15 % \u0102\u0097 18,6 %."}
