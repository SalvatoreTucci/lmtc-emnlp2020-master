Properly functioning seed potato production systems thus require healthy starting material that is multiplied with a minimal rate of degeneration.\n(2) Different national standards on the production of pre-basic seed potatoes have obstructed the marketing of those potatoes throughout the Union, and have impeded the functioning of the internal market. Therefore it is appropriate to establish minimum conditions under which pre-basic seed potatoes may be marketed throughout the Union. Those conditions should concern diseases, symptoms, defects and production requirements for pre-basic seed potatoes, and lots of those potatoes, to ensure the production and marketing of healthy and high quality pre-basic seed potatoes.\n(3) Those conditions should take into account the standard of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), concerning the marketing and commercial quality control of seed potatoes, as well as the relevant standards of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), in view of technical and scientific developments. Those standards aim at helping facilitate international trade, encouraging high quality production, improving profitability and protecting consumer interests.\n(4) In view of the production practices of suppliers, and the demand of the users of pre-basic seed potatoes, it is appropriate that the minimum conditions for pre-basic seed potatoes also include the possibility for marketing them as Union grades. Two Union grades should apply for pre-basic seed potatoes (\u2018Union grade PBTC\u2019 and \u2018Union grade PB\u2019), in line with the existing production practices concerning pre-basic seed potatoes of grade PBTC, and pre-basic seed potatoes of grade PB. Different conditions per grade should thus be adopted concerning diseases, symptoms, defects, production requirements and generations for those grades.\n(5) In order to be effective, those rules should also set out provisions concerning official testing and official field inspections.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018mother plant\u2019 means an identified plant from which material is taken for propagation;\n(2) \u2018micro-propagation\u2019 means the practice of rapidly multiplying plant material to produce a large number of plants, using culture in vitro of differentiated vegetative buds or meristem taken from a plant.", "Minimum conditions for pre-basic seed potatoes\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that pre-basic seed potatoes satisfy the following minimum conditions:\n(a) they derive from mother plants which are free from the following harmful organisms: Pectobacterium spp., Dickeya spp., Potato leaf roll virus, Potato virus A, Potato virus M, Potato virus S, Potato virus X, and Potato virus Y;\n(b) they are free from symptoms of blackleg;\n(c) the number of growing plants not breeding true to the variety and the number of plants of a different variety together, shall not exceed 0,01\u00a0%;\n(d) in the direct progeny, the number of plants showing symptoms of virus infection shall not exceed 0,5\u00a0%;\n(e) the number of growing plants with mosaic symptoms or symptoms caused by leaf roll virus shall not exceed 0,1\u00a0%;\n(f) the maximum number of field generations shall be four.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide that pre-basic seed potatoes may be marketed as \u2018Union grades PBTC\u2019 and \u2018Union grade PB\u2019, in accordance with the conditions set out in the Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compliance with the requirements of paragraph 1(b), (c) and (e) shall be established through official field inspections.
