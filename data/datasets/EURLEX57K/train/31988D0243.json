The aid will cover only 51 % of the anticipated operating losses and therefore complies with the conditions of Article 3 (1) of the Decision.\nThe aid to cover operating losses is aimed at phasing the closure of certain pits. A contribution is thereby made to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry pursuant to the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision;\nThe French Government proposes to grant aid to CERCHAR for 1988 in order to provide support for technical research in the coalmining sector. The amount of this aid, which has been in existence for many years and was approved by the Commission as a general measure pursuant to Article 67 of the ECSC Treaty, is FF 80 000 000; whereas the conditions for the granting of this aid remain unchanged.\nII\nThe following observations should be made on the compatibility of the proposed aid with the proper functioning of the common market:\n- in view of the size of coal and coke stocks, no supply difficulties are likely to occur in 1988,\n- deliveries of French coal to other Community countries are very small,\n- price alignment agreements with respect to Community producers are unlikely to arise in 1988,\n- French coal prices should not, in principle lead to indirect aid to industrial coal users in 1988.\nTherefore, the aid proposed in 1988 for current production by the French coal industry is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nIII\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that the approved aid for current production is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 of the Decision. Consequently, the Commission must be informed in particular of the amount of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["France is hereby authorized to grant aid in the amount of FF 1 741 000 000 to the French coalmining industry from 1 January 1988 for the 1988 calendar year.\nThe total amount shall be made up of the following aids:\n1.
