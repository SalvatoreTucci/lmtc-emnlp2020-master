However, as the applications were not made before 19 January 2008, the requirement provided for in point (b) of Article 28(6) of that Regulation is not fulfilled, and therefore those claims may not benefit from the transition period provided for in that Article.\n(21) The health claims related to Yestimun\u00ae, and to blackcurrant seed oil (Ribes nigrum), fish oil, lycopene from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) extract, vitamin C and vitamin E, are health claims as referred to in point (a) of Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and are therefore subject to the transition period laid down in Article 28(5) of that Regulation. As the Authority concluded that cause and effect relationships have not been established between the foods and the respective claimed effects, the two claims do not comply with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and therefore they may not benefit from the transition period provided for in that Article.\n(22) In order to ensure that this Regulation is fully complied with, both food business operators and the national competent authorities should take the necessary actions to ensure that, at the latest six months following the entry into force of this Regulation, products bearing the health claims listed in its Annex are no longer present on the market.\n(23) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["The health claims set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall not be included in the Union list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.\nHowever, products bearing these health claims placed on the market or labelled prior to the date referred to in Article 2 may remain on the market for a maximum period of six months after that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1602.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1602.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1604.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1605.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1606.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1607.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8 (5):1608.\nANNEX\nRejected health claims\nApplication \u2014 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 13(5).
