The measures were, by Decision 2001/312/EC(5), extended until 1 February 2002.\n(2) During 2001, five more outbreaks of ISA have been detected in the Faroe Islands. An eradication of the disease is not envisaged in the near future.\n(3) In the light of the epidemiological situation with regards to ISA in the Faroe Islands, the measures of Decision 2000/574/EC shall be extended to 1 February 2003.\n(4) It is appropriate to prolong the restriction measures concerning the eggs and gametes of the family Salmonidae provided for in Article 1(2) of Decision 2000/574/EC until the risk of transmission of ISA via these products is reviewed and properly assessed. The period for the review of these measures shall therefore also be extended until 1 February 2003.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 4 of Decision 2000/574/EC the words \"1 February 2002\" are replaced by \"1 February 2003\".", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 February 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.\n(2) OJ L 162, 1.7.1996, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(4) OJ L 240, 23.9.2000, p. 26.\n(5) OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 66."}
