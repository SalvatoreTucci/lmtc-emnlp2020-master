Annex I to that Regulation lists the products excluded from the definition of fishery products. The list of excluded products may be reviewed each year and should be amended on the basis of new information gathered under the administrative cooperation with third countries provided for in Article 20(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\n(2) Products excluded from the definition of fisheries products are equally listed in Annex XIII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1010/2009\u00a0(2) laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008. In order to avoid unnecessary duplications, excluded products should be listed only in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 and Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1010/2009 should thus be deleted.\n(3) Title I of Regulation (EC) No 1010/2009 lays down provisions on the inspection of third country fishing vessels to be carried out in Member States ports. It is necessary to align those provisions with the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, concluded in the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). Such alignment implies the inclusion of specific information in the template to be used for prior notification of port arrivals and the addition of specific criteria to the benchmarks set out for port inspections.\n(4) Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1010/2009 lays down a list of catch documentation schemes adopted by regional fisheries management organisations which are recognised as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.
