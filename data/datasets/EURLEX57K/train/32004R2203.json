The number of returning holdings to be selected in each division may differ by up to 20\u00a0% in either direction provided that this does not entail a reduction in the total number of returning holdings per Member State.\n(2) As the financial management of such a measure is difficult, a limitation per Member State as to the total number of duly completed farm returns eligible for Community financing is introduced in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1915/83 of 13 July 1983 on certain detailed implementing rules concerning the keeping of accounts for the purpose of determining the incomes of agricultural holdings\u00a0(3). For reasons of clarity and coherence, this change should be reflected in Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82. Flexibility in the number of returning holdings per division should remain allowed, as long as the total number of the returning holdings of the Member State concerned is respected.\n(3) In view of the limitation per Member State of the total number of duly completed farm returns eligible for Community financing, the number of returning holdings laid down in Annex I for Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France and Luxembourg should be adjusted, to maintain the actual sample size.\n(4) The number of returning holdings per division in Sweden should be adjusted, due to changes in the borders between the divisions.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 is amended as follows:\n1.
