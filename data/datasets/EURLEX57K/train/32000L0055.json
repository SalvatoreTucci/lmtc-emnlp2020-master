The various models of ballasts for fluorescent lighting available on the Community market have very different levels of consumption for a given type of lamp, i.e. extremely variable energy efficiency.\n(3) This Directive aims at reducing energy consumption for ballasts for fluorescent lighting by moving gradually away from the less efficient ballasts, and towards the more efficient ballasts which may also offer extensive energy-saving features.\n(4) Some Member States are on the point of adopting provisions relating to the efficiency of ballasts for fluorescent lighting, which might create barriers to trade in these products in the Community.\n(5) It is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection. This Directive ensures a high level of protection for both the environment and the consumer, in aiming at a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of ballasts.\n(6) In accordance with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles laid down by Article 5 of the Treaty, as the objectives of this action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, they can, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(7) An effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that this Directive is implemented properly, guarantees fair conditions of competition for producers and protects consumer rights.\n(8) Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives(4), applies, except as regards marking and withdrawal from the market, where departure to a limited extent from the Decision is justified by the type of product and the specific market situation.\n(9) In the interest of international trade, international standards should be used wherever appropriate. The electricity consumption of a ballast is defined by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation Standard EN 50294 of December 1998, which is based on international standards.\n(10) Ballasts for fluorescent lighting complying with the energy efficiency requirements of this Directive must bear the \"CE\" marking and associated information, in order to enable them to move freely.\n(11) This Directive is confined to ballasts for fluorescent lighting, supplied by mains electricity,", "main_body": ["1.

This is a function of the lamp power and of the type of ballast; for this reason, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits of a given ballast is defined as the maximum ballast-lamp circuit power, with different levels for each lamp power and ballast type.\nThe terms used in this Annex correspond to the definitions in European Standard EN 50294 of December 1998 laid down by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation.\nANNEX III\nFIRST PHASE\nThe maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits expressed in W is defined by the following table:\n>TABLE>\nWhenever a ballast is designed for a lamp which falls between two values indicated in the above table, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuit is calculated by linear interpolation between the two values of maximum input power for the two closest lamps power indicated in the table.\nFor example if a ballast in lamp category 1 is rated for a 48 W lamp at 50 Hz, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuit is calculated as follows:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nANNEX IV\nSECOND PHASE\nThe maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits expressed in W is defined by the following table:\n>TABLE>\nWhenever a ballast is designed for a lamp which falls between two values indicated in the above table, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuit is calculated by linear interpolation between the two values of maximum input power for the two closest lamps power indicated in the table.\nFor example if a ballast in lamp category 1 is rated for a 48 W lamp at 50 Hz, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuit is calculated as follows:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nJoint declarations by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission\nThe Commission shall also assess the share of Community production of ballasts exported outside the Community market either as a single component or incorporated into luminaires. The Commission shall further assess the possibility of applying the flexibility mechanisms defined under the Kyoto Protocol. The Commission shall promote in the appropriate fora international standards based on the principles of this Directive.\nProposals for a third phase as referred to in Article 9(2) might be necessary if, before the assessment is completed on 31 december 2005, the results achieved are not those expected, the expectation in question being that the average market share, at EU level, of ballasts meeting the energy efficiency standards of CELMA type A would be greater than 55 %."}
