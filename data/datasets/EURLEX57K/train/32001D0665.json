The validity of the measures adopted under Decision 1999/815/EC on the basis of Article 9 of Article 92/59/EEC was prolonged under Commission Decisions 2000/217/EC(3), 2000/381/EC(4), 2000/535/EC(5), 2000/769/EC(6), 2001/195/EC(7) and 2001/467/EC(8) for an additional period of three months each time, in accordance with the provision of Article 11(2) of the said Directive; therefore the validity of the Decision is to expire on 6 September 2001.\n(5) Some relevant developments have taken place recently concerning the validation of phthalates migration test methods. However, further work in this area is still necessary to try to solve some crucial outstanding difficulties.\n(6) The reasons which motivated Decision 1999/815/EC and its prolongation under Decisions 2000/217/EC, 2000/381/EC, 2000/535/EC, 200/769/EC, 2001/195/EC and 2001/467/EC are still valid and it is therefore necessary to maintain the prohibition of the placing on the market of the products considered.\n(7) Certain Member States have implemented Decision 1999/815/EC as modified by Decisions 2000/217/EC, 2000/381/EC, 2000/535/EC, 2000/769/EC, 2001/195/EC and 2001/467/EC by measures applicable until 6 September 2001. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that the validity of these measures is prolonged.\n(8) It is therefore necessary to prolong the validity of Decision 1999/815/EC for a seventh time in order to ensure that all the Member States maintain the prohibition provided for by that Decision. According to Article 11(2) of Directive 92/59/EEC the validity may be prolonged for a period of three months.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Emergencies Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 5 of Decision 1999/815/EC the words \"6 September 2001\" are replaced by the words \"21 November 2001\".", "Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Decision within less than 10 days of its notification.
