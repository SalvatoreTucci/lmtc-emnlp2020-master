This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 2002/2003 marketing year.\n(2) In order to rectify this situation, it is appropriate to make use of export refunds to zones which may be supplied by the Community. The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the quantities of rice benefiting from refunds, and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the amount of refund to be fixed by tendering procedure.\n(3) It should be stated that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 299/95(4), applies to this invitation to tender.\n(4) For the sake of sound management of the markets, the invitation to tender should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6), and certain destinations excluded.\n(5) Pursuant to Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2452/2000(8), amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article specify the operative events applicable to advances and securities.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
