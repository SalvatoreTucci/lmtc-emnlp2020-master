This states that the EACCE has the necessary staff, equipment and facilities to carry out checks, that it uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from Morocco to the Community meet the Community marketing standards.\n(3) The information sent by the Member States to the Commission shows that, in the period 1997 to 2000, the incidence of non-conformity with marketing standards among imports of fresh fruit and vegetables from Morocco was relatively low.\n(4) For a number of years representatives of the Moroccan inspection body have been regular participants at various seminars and training activities organised by different Member States. They have also occasionally participated in international efforts to agree marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, such as the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).\n(5) On the basis of the information gathered, conformity with the marketing standards should be considered to be satisfactorily met, the approval provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 should be granted and the official authority and the inspection body in Morocco should be designated.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Checks on conformity with marketing standards carried out by Morocco on fresh fruit and vegetables from Morocco are hereby approved in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001.", "The particulars of the official authority in Morocco under whose responsibility the checking operations are performed and of the inspection body in charge of carrying out those checks, as referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001, are given in Annex I to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the date of publication in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Communities of the notice referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001, relating to the establishment of administrative cooperation between the Community and Morocco.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 October 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 156, 13.6.2001, p. 9.\n(4) OJ L 321, 6.12.2001, p. 15.\nANNEX\nOfficial authority referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001: Minister for Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Forests Quartier Administratif Place Abdallah Chefchouani BP 607 Rabat Morocco Tel.
