That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 as a feed additive for salmonids, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) Its use was also provisionally authorised for salmonids by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 for salmonids. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 10 November 2010\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the phosphorus utilisation. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) In the interest of clarity, the entry on 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 in Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 should be deleted.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Regulation (EC) No 521/2005, Article 2 and Annex II are deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 84, 2.4.2005, p. 3.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal 2010; 8(12):1915.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
