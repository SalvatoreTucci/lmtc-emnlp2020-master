In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of \"cereal products\", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for \"other cereals\", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.\n(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.\n(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.\n(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.\n(7) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The export refunds on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 November 2002.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 October 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 51.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 October 2002 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and the \"A\" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10 All destinations except for Estonia."}
