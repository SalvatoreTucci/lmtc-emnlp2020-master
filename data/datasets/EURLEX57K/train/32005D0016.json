The letter also stipulated that the European Union would closely follow the political development and transitional reform in your country and continue the intensive political dialogue on the basis of Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and the outcome of the consultations as set out in our letter reference SGS 272745 of 27 March 2002.\nMore than a year has passed since the National Transitional Government of Liberia took office following the signing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement in August 2003. It is now time to take stock of progress in the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and the undertakings that resulted from the aforementioned consultations.\nThe European Union is pleased to note at this juncture that security and calm have returned to the country and that some initial steps to introduce democratic change and to reform the functioning of the public sector have been made. Serious concerns remain, however, over public finance and macro-economic management by the National Transitional Government of Liberia and the State-owned enterprises, and over the increasing level of corruption. Furthermore, the commissions created under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement have to date shown insufficient progress in the implementation of their mandates to improve governance and accountability. Further steps in addressing human rights issues are also required.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union considers that the National Transitional Government of Liberia is not fully functional and operational and the appropriate measures can therefore not yet be completely revoked. This will be done once a democratically elected and accountable President and government have been installed.\nFor this reason, the European Union has decided that Council Decision 2003/631/EC of 25 August 2003 shall be extended for a period of 18 months. During this period our intensive political dialogue should continue, on the basis of Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and on the basis of the outcome of the consultations as set out in our letter reference SGS 272745 of 27 March 2002, with a view to continue improving respect for human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance. The dialogue shall involve the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission and include six-monthly political reviews.\nMeanwhile, on the basis of the appropriate measures defined in Council Decision 2003/631/EC of 25 August 2003, support for the peace process and the Results Focused Transitional Framework shall continue.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
