That Decision provides that it is only possible to allow imports to continue on a secure basis by strengthening the control and surveillance of holdings from which animals eligible for export to the Community are sourced and by establishing a provisional list of such approved holdings drawn up by Brazil for which certain guarantees are provided.\n(3) In recent years Brazil has been the main supplier of beef on the Community market, accounting for around two-thirds of the total Community imports in the beef sector. As a result of the application of Decision 2008/61/EC, operators that had obtained, prior to the entry into force of that Decision, import licences for the importation of bovine meat within the import tariff quotas referred to in Article 2(d) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 936/97 of 27 May 1997 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for high-quality fresh, chilled and frozen beef and frozen buffalo meat\u00a0(4), Commission Regulation (EC) No 529/2007 of 11 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206\u00a029\u00a091 (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)\u00a0(5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 545/2007 of 16 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)\u00a0(6), are faced with certain practical difficulties to source the products within the normal period of the validity of the import licences. In view of these particular circumstances, the validity of the licences should, on a temporary basis, be extended until the end of the import tariff quota period.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95, for the import tariff quota period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008, the licences issued in accordance with Article 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 936/97, Regulation (EC) No 529/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 545/2007 shall be valid until 30 June 2008.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 21.
