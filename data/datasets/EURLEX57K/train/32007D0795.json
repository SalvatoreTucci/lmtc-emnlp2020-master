Decision as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p. 1).\nANNEX\nDomain: Food safety, animal health and welfare and zootechnics.\nLegal basis: Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field.\nPolitical objectives: The Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010\u00a0(1) identified several areas of action in particular the upgrading of existing minimum standards for animal protection and welfare and introducing standardised animal welfare indicators. Concerning animal transport, advice from scientific experts indicates that new appropriate rules on travelling times and loading densities are needed. Commissioner Kyprianou therefore announced several times as during the Agriculture Council in October 2007 that the Commission is studying this question with the aim of proposing a revision of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005\u00a0(2) in 2009.\nAs regards to animal welfare labelling, the Action Plan asks the Commission to submit a report on the possibility of a mandatory labelling scheme for chicken meat and meat products based on compliance with animal welfare standards and to report to the Council and the Parliament on the further application of measurable indicators in Community animal welfare legislation. Furthermore the Council invited the Commission in May 2007\u00a0(3) to submit a report to the Council on animal welfare labelling in order to allow an in-depth debate on this subject. For these reasons it is necessary to submit a broader study on the impact of animal welfare labelling and on an Animal Welfare Reference Center which could serve as European coordinating body for the different initiatives related to animal welfare (standardisation/certification of welfare indicators, auditing schemes, databases related to existing certified labels).\nAssignments: Various types of studies and other services supporting the design and preparation of Commission proposals.\nStudies and other services supporting the implementation of the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010 have been scheduled for 2007, in particular for the preparation of impact assessments in relation to animal transport, slaughter and the preparation of a report on animal welfare labelling as requested by the Council.\nAppropriations 2007: 17 04 02 01 \u2014 Other measures in the veterinary, animal welfare and public-health field: EUR 700\u00a0000.\nNumber of specific actions planned: Approximately four.\nAll actions shall be governed by common public procurement rules and will be carried out through specific contracts under a framework contract. Specific contracts will be signed during the last quarter of 2007.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010, COM(2006) 13 final.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Conference on \u2018Animal Welfare\u2019 \u2014 Improving by Labelling? \u2014 Council Conclusions, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/agricult/94008.pdf"}
