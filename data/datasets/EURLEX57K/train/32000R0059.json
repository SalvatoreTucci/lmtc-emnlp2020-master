REQUEST FOR A REVIEW\n(1) The Commission has received an application for a \"new exporter\" review pursuant to Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as \"the basic Regulation\"). The application was lodged by Bulten Fasteners China Co. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \"the applicant\"), an exporting producer in the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as \"the PRC\").\nB. PRODUCT\n(2) The product concerned is stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof (hereafter referred to as \"SSFs\"), originating in the PRC. The product described is currently classifiable within CN codes 7318 12 10, 7318 14 10, 7318 15 30, 7318 15 51, 7318 15 61, 7318 15 70 and 7318 16 30. These CN codes are only given for information.\nC. EXISTING MEASURES\n(3) By Council Regulation (EC) No 393/98(3), the Council imposed, inter alia, a definitive anti-dumping duty of 74,7 % on imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC, with the exception of imports from two exporting producers for which the Council imposed individual duty rates.\nD. GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW\n(4) The applicant, has claimed that it operates under market economy conditions as provided for in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, that it meets the conditions for individual treatment, that it is not related to the Chinese exporting producers which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures, and that it started exporting to the Community after the period of investigations on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 January 1996 to 30 November 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the original investigation period\").\n(5) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.\n(6) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a review pursuant to Article 11(3) and (4) of the basic Regulation with a view to determining the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.\nE. PROCEDURE\n(7) Questionnaires\nIn order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporting producer, the importer named in the application, and to the authorities of the PRC.\n(8) Collection of information and holding of hearings\nAll interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n(9) Selection of the market economy third country\nIn accordance with Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, Taiwan is envisaged as an appropriate market economy third country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC.\n(10) Market economy status\nIf the applicant claims and provides properly substantiated evidence that it operates under market economy conditions, i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. The Commission will send a claim form to the applicant, as well as to the Chinese authorities.\nF. REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(11) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of that Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a determination of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\nG. TIME-LIMIT\n(12) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be fixed within which:\n- interested parties may make their views known in writing, submit supporting evidence and make a written request for a hearing,\n- parties to the investigation can comment on the choice of Taiwan being envisaged as an analogue country,\n- an applicant can submit a properly substantiated claim for market economy status.\nH. NON-COOPERATION\n(13) It should be noted that in cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within the relevant time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(14) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available,", "main_body": ["A review of Regulation (EC) No 393/98 is hereby initiated in order to determine if and to what extent imports of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof falling within CN codes 7318 12 10, 7318 14 10, 7318 15 30, 7318 15 51, 7318 15 61, 7318 15 70 and 7318 16 30, originating in the People's Republic of China, produced and sold for export to the Community by Bulten Fasteners China Co.
