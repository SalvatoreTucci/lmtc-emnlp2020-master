Accordingly it is appropriate to define the minimum level of checks to be carried out by Member States in order to verify the proper implementation of the requirements for the identification and registration of those animals, as provided for in that Regulation (the checks).\n(2) The competent authority of each Member State should carry out checks based on a risk analysis. The risk analysis should take into account all relevant factors, including in particular, animal health considerations.\n(3) The percentage of holdings and animals to be checked in the Member States should be laid down. Before 31 December 2009 those rates will be reviewed in the light of the results of the reports on the checks carried out and submitted by the Member States.\n(4) As a general rule, all animals on a holding should be covered by the checks. However, for holdings with more than 20 animals the competent authority should be permitted to restrict the checks to an appropriate representative sample of the animals.\n(5) Member States should submit an annual report to the Commission providing information on the implementation of the checks.
