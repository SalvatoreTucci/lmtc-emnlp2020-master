Furthermore, the International Vine and Wine Office has organised a validation study of some of these methods with a view to their recognition as reference methods. This review of the validity of the usual methods will require a further two years of study, during which time it is advisable that the methods remain as described in Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should therefore be amended so that the repeal of the usual methods described in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 is postponed for two years.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["The date of 1 August 2001 in Article 44 of Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is replaced by 1 August 2003.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 August 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 328, 23.12.2000, p. 2.\n(3) OJ L 194, 31.7.2000, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 128, 10.5.2001, p. 54.\n(5) OJ L 272, 3.10.1990, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 99, 14.4.1999, p. 4."}
