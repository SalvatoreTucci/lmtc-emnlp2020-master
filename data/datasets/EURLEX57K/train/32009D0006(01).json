As part of its tasks in accordance with Articles 17, 18 and 22 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Eurosystem envisages that T2S will be a service based on a single platform allowing for core, neutral and borderless pan-European cash and securities settlement, which will be offered to CSDs to enable them to provide their customers with harmonised and commoditised delivery-versus-payment settlement services in central bank money in an integrated technical environment.\n(2) On 17 July 2008, the Governing Council decided to launch T2S and to provide the resources required until its completion. On the basis of an offer made by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de Espa\u00f1a, the Banque de France and the Banca d\u2019Italia, the Governing Council also decided that T2S would be developed and operated by these four national central banks (NCBs).\n(3) The effective and efficient organisation of T2S involving both internal and external stakeholders requires the establishment of a streamlined management body that will develop proposals for the Governing Council on key strategic issues and execute tasks of a purely technical nature (hereinafter the \u2018T2S Programme Board\u2019).\n(4) Under the principle of decentralisation laid down in Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, NCBs carry out operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem central banks will therefore entrust the T2S Programme Board with certain implementing tasks so that it can be fully operational and act on behalf of the whole Eurosystem. The Payment and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC) will maintain its advisory role to the ECB\u2019s decision-making bodies,", "main_body": ["T2S Programme Board\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The T2S Programme Board shall be established as a streamlined management body of the Eurosystem with the task of developing proposals for the Governing Council on key strategic issues and executing tasks of a purely technical nature in relation to T2S.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mandate of the T2S Programme Board, including its objectives, responsibilities, tasks, composition, working procedures, and budget, shall be as set out in the Annex to this Decision.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The names and resum\u00e9s of candidates to be considered for appointment to the T2S Programme Board members shall be sent by members of the Governing Council to the Executive Board so that they are received no later than 8 April 2009.

The T2S services will allow for the core, neutral and borderless, i.e. pan-European, settlement of securities transactions on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis in central bank money, on a single technical platform integrated with the real-time gross settlement systems settling in central bank money of each participating currency.\nIn view of the provision of the T2S Services, the ECB Governing Council, as ultimate decision-making body of the Eurosystem, established the T2S Programme Board to assist the ECB decision-making bodies in ensuring the successful and timely completion of the T2S programme.\nThe T2S Programme Board is also based on a T2S Protocol signed by the Eurosystem central banks. Without prejudice to the ultimate decision-making powers of the ECB decision-making bodies, the T2S Programme Board is entrusted with the autonomous performance of clearly defined executive tasks related to the T2S programme. The T2S Programme Board will report directly to the Governing Council regularly. The advisory functions of ESCB committees, in particular the PSSC, LEGCO and the EISC, are not affected by the establishment of the T2S Programme Board. The T2S Programme Board may seek and receive guidance from the Governing Council on T2S related issues in case of uncertainty or doubt.\nIf and when new issues related to T2S arise, the T2S Programme Board may be assigned further clearly defined executive tasks. In light of the Governing Council\u2019s final competence in T2S issues, any tasks performed by the T2S Programme Board may be addressed by the Governing Council.\nOBJECTIVES\nBased on this mandate, the T2S Programme Board ensures that the T2S programme is implemented:\n\u2014 in accordance with market expectations, as reflected in the user requirement document (URD) dated 21 May 2008, as amended from time to time,\n\u2014 within the budget defined by the Governing Council,\n\u2014 no later than June 2013.\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nIn view of meeting its objectives, the T2S Programme Board is responsible for:\n\u2014 submitting proposals to the ECB decision-making bodies on T2S issues that are of a strategic nature and might have an impact on the timely and successful implementation of the T2S programme within the agreed parameters,\n\u2014 managing the T2S programme on a daily basis,\n\u2014 managing the relations with T2S clients and external stakeholders,\n\u2014 reporting on the T2S programme to the ECB decision-making bodies on a regular and structured basis,\n\u2014 interacting with the 4CB.\nTASKS\nIn view of fulfilling its responsibilities, the following executive tasks are assigned to the T2S Programme Board:\n1.

The PSSC, the EISC, the BUCOM and the T2S Advisory Group are consulted before the budget proposal is sent to the Governing Council.\nAs much as possible and appropriate, the T2S Programme Board follows the procedures of the ECB, and the support functions of the ECB.
