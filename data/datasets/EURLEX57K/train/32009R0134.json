The first criterion requires that it is demonstrated and documented that exposure in all scenarios is well below an appropriate derived no-effect level (DNEL) or predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) derived under specific conditions. The second criterion requires that it is demonstrated and documented that strictly controlled conditions apply throughout the life cycle. The third criterion requires that where the substance is incorporated in an article, the substance is incorporated in such a way that no exposure can take place and the substance is not released during its life cycle and is handled under strictly controlled conditions during all manufacturing and production stages. Consequently, these criteria for justification for the omission of testing should be incorporated in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,", "main_body": ["Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 February 2009.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0396, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01; corrected by OJ L\u00a0136, 29.5.2007, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nSection 3 of Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBSTANCE-TAILORED EXPOSURE-DRIVEN TESTING\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Testing in accordance with Sections 8.6 and 8.7 of Annex VIII and in accordance with Annex IX and Annex X may be omitted, based on the exposure scenario(s) developed in the Chemical Safety Report.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided.
