It was concluded that in the case of emergency measures for the eradication of the organism in areas where only a very limited number of specimens of the organism were found, measures applied during a period of two years may be sufficient to eradicate it. It should therefore be provided for that those measures may be limited to a period of two years, where appropriate.\n(3) Decision 2003/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2003/766/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
