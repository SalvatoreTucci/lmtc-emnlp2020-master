As a consequence, it is appropriate to reduce the quantitative limits for 2003 by 30 % compared to the quantitative limits set for 2002, pending a satisfactory solution to this issue and the conclusion of the negotiations of the new Agreement,", "main_body": ["During the period mentioned in Annex I, imports into the European Community of steel products referred to in Annex II originating in Ukraine shall be subject to licensing. Licenses shall be issued only within the limits defined in Article 2.", "Imports shall be authorised, for each product group and for the whole of the Community, up to the quantitative limits indicated in Annex I.\nThe period of validity of the import licence is hereby fixed at four months. Unused or partially used import licences may be renewed for two months.", "Member States shall issue licences according to rules agreed within the Steel Liaison Committee and inform the Commission thereof immediately. The Commission shall keep the Member States regularly informed of the extent to which the quantities have been used up.\nThe Member States and the Commission shall confer in order to ensure that these quantities are not exceeded.", "The provisions of the agreement on trade in certain steel products together with any measures to give effect to it, shall as from the date of entry into force of the agreement replace the provisions of this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nL.
