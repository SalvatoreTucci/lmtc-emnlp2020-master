Article 6 (1) (a) is replaced by the following:\n'(a) he shall not be authorized to transfer and/or temporarily lease his rights during the three following marketing years. However, and in respect of the 1993 and 1994 marketing years, this provision shall not apply to rights obtained through transfer and/or temporary lease during the marketing year in question before notification of the allocation of rights from the national reserves relating to that same marketing year.`\n2. Article 6 (2) is replaced by the following:\n'2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and except:\n- in the case of producers participating in an extensification programme recognized by the Commission,\n- in the case of producers participating in an early retirement scheme recognized by the Commission in which the transfer and/or temporary lease of rights is not obligatory, or\n- in duly justified exceptional cases,\nwhere producers have not made use of at least 50 % of their rights during each of two consecutive marketing years, the part not used during the last marketing year shall be transferred to the national reserve.`\n3. In Article 7 (4), the final sentence is replaced by the following:\n'However, for producers participating in early retirement schemes or who have, prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1720/94 (amending Regulation), undertaken to participate in extensification programmes recognized by the Commission, Member States may provide for an extension of the total duration of the temporary lease on the basis of such programmes.\nProducers who, subsequent to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1720/94 (amending Regulation), undertake to participate in an extensification programme in accordance with the measure referred to in Article 2 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 shall not be authorized to temporarily lease and/or to transfer their rights throughout the period of that participation. However, this provision shall not apply:\n- in cases where the extensification programme permits the transfer and/or temporary lease of rights to producers whose participation in the measures other than the extensification measure referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 requires the acquisition of rights,\n- to producers able to prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that, prior to the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1720/94, they had already notified those authorities of the transfer and/or temporary lease of rights in accordance with paragraph 2.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 289, 7. 10. 1989, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 121, 12. 5. 1994, p. 9.\n(3) OJ No L 215, 30. 7. 1992, p. 85.\n(4) OJ No L 215, 30. 7. 1992, p. 91.\n(5) OJ No L 362, 11. 12. 1992, p. 41.\n(6) OJ No L 95, 14. 4. 1994, p. 8."}
