That Regulation provides that food business operators are to ensure that establishments are approved by the competent authority, following at least one on-site visit when approval is required under national legislation, under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) or under a decision adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.\n(2) Following the outbreaks of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in May 2011 in the Union, consumption of sprouts was identified as the most likely origin of the outbreaks.\n(3) On 20 October 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018EFSA\u2019) adopted a Scientific Opinion on the risk posed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other pathogenic bacteria in seeds and sprouted seeds\u00a0(3). In its Opinion, EFSA concludes that the contamination of dry seeds with bacterial pathogens is the most likely initial source of the sprout-associated outbreaks. In addition, the Opinion states that, due to the high humidity and the favourable temperature during sprouting, bacterial pathogens present on dry seeds can multiply during sprouting and result in a public health risk.\n(4) In order to ensure the protection of public health in the Union and in view of that EFSA Opinion, Commission Regulation (EU) No 209/2013\u00a0(4) amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs\u00a0(5), Commission Regulation (EU) No 211/2013\u00a0(6) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 208/2013\u00a0(7) were adopted.\n(5) In addition to the measures laid down in those acts, establishments producing sprouts should be subject to approval in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. Such approvals, granted following at least one on-site visit, would ensure that such establishments comply with the relevant hygiene rules, thereby ensuring a high level of protection of public health. The approval of such establishments should be conditional upon their compliance with a number of requirements in order to ensure that the possibility of contamination within the facility where sprouts are produced is reduced.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Regulation, the definition of \u2018sprouts\u2019 in Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 208/2013 shall apply.", "Food business operators shall ensure that establishments producing sprouts are approved by the competent authority in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.
