Those amendments were based on the results of the tests carried out by the Member States and on the guarantees provided by the competent authority in Thailand.\n(3) The results of the reinforced checks carried out by Member States in poultrymeat imported from Thailand continue to be favourable. Therefore, the reinforced checks imposed by Decision 2002/251/EC, as amended by Decision 2003/559/EC, should no longer be applied to those consignments certified by the Thai authority after the date of 21 September 2002 as having been submitted to a systematic pre-shipment check. Systematic checks should only be maintained for consignments certified prior to that date.\n(4) Decision 2002/251/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/251/EC is amended as follows:", "(1) is replaced by the following:\n\"1.

The test must be carried out, in particular, with a view to detecting the presence of antimicrobial substances and in particular nitrofurans and their metabolites.\"", "This Decision shall apply from 23 December 2003.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2003.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1.
