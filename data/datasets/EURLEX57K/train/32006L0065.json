It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye chemicals.\n(2) The SCCNFP recommended in addition an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dyes including the requirements for testing hair dye cosmetic ingredients for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.\n(3) Following the opinions of the SCCNFP, the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders agreed on an overall strategy to regulate hair dyes according to which the industry was required to submit the files with scientific data on hair dyes to be evaluated by the SCCNFP.\n(4) As a first step in the implementation of the strategy it was decided to give priority to permanent hair dye substances for which no explicit interest was expressed during the public consultation in defence of their use in hair dyes. Those substances should therefore be banned.\n(5) According to the opinion of the SCCNFP, certain azo dyes pose a risk to the health of the consumer. They were therefore deleted from the positive list of colouring agents allowed for use in cosmetic products in Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC. For the same reason they should also be banned for use in hair dyes.\n(6) For hair dye substances provisionally allowed in part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC the provisional period should be extended.\n(7) Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that from 1 December 2006 at the latest no cosmetic products which fail to comply with this Directive are placed on the market by Community manufacturers or by importers established within the Community, nor sold or disposed of to the final consumer.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 September 2006 at the latest.
