This authorisation was granted for a period which ended on 31 December 2005.\n(5) During the application of the system, the activity in the sheep and cattle sector in the Isle of Man has been maintained. However, the Commission reported to the Council that structural problems in the sector may impede the long-term sustainability of the livestock production on the Island. Therefore, the current regime is prolonged for the last time to allow for the restructuring of the sheepmeat and beef industry on the Isle of Man.\n(6) In order to provide for continuous application of the system after 31 December 2005, the date of application of this Decision should be fixed to 1 January 2006.\n(7) Decision 82/530/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 2 of Decision 82/530/EEC shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 2\nThis Decision shall apply until 31 December 2010.\u2019", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 February 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
