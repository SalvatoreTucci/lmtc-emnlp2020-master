Should supply of the Community market be affected by exceptional circumstances affecting production or importation, the Commission shall adopt the specific measures necessary under the procedure set out in Article 27.\nIn such cases the additional tariff quota provided for in paragraph 2 may be adjusted on the basis of the balance sheet indicated in paragraph 7. The specific measures may derogate from the rules adopted under Article 19(1). They must not discriminate between supply origins.\n9.
