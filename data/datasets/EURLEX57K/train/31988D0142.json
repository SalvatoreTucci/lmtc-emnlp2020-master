whereas it forwarded at a later date additional information concerning the programme;\nWhereas it is necessary to consider whether, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the programme fulfills the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;\nWhereas a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources was introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 (2);\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 is aimed at facilitating the structural development of the fisheries sector within the framework of the guidelines of the common fisheries policy; whereas such structural development may be encouraged by appropriate measures supported with Community financial aid;\nWhereas such measures should help to create a fishing fleet that is adapted to likely medium-term catch opportunities in both Community and non-Community waters; whereas these measures should, in particular, be based on an attempt to ensure balanced exploitation of internal resources in Community waters;\nWhereas the measures implemented under the Community rules adopted for the decade from 1987 to 1997 are a continuation of the efforts made since 1983 to improve the structural situation up to 31 December 1986 through common measures to restructure, modernize and develop the fisheries sector; whereas, therefore, the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decision 85/285/EEC (3) constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the effort still needed to ensure that the Community objectives are achieved;\nWhereas the objectives of the preceding guidance programme for 1986 have not been fully achieved; whereas the current or likely situation as regards availabilities in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned do not allow for any adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved; whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1987 to 1991;\nWhereas these forecasts could be reviewed were there to be any significant change in availabilities, backed up by scientific evidence, and in the light of the development of international fishery relations between the Community and coastal third States;\nWhereas, in addition, the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme period between fishing capacities and availabilities;\nWhereas the desired structural adjustments should be implemented on a gradual and continuing basis to reduce the economic and social impact they may have to a minimum;\nWhereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;\nWhereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy;

GENERAL REMARKS\nThe programme relates to the whole of the Irish fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Ireland.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall capacity of the fleet;\n(b) to renew and modernize the fleet; principally with regard to all boats of less than 12 metres length.\n2. The following limitations should apply to the development of the fleet during the period covered by the programme:\n(Tonnage (GRT))\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // Objective of programme 2908/83   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987   // Objective at 31. 12. 1991  //    //   //   //   // Vessels less than 12 m   // 7 000  // 8 264   // 6 790   // Vessels 12 m and over   // 38 300  // 44 801   // 37 151   //    //   //   //   // Total  // 45 300   // 53 065   // 43 941   //    //   //   //\n(Engine power (kW))\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // Objective of programme 2908/83 (1)   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987 (1)   // Objective at 31. 12. 1991   //    //   //   //   // Vessels less than 12 m   // 28 000   // 33 056   // 27 440   // Vessels 12 and over   // 153 200   // 179 204   // 150 136   //  Total  // 181 200   // 212 260   // 177 576   //    //   //   //\n(1) Estimates; within six months of this Decision, Ireland must confirm or modify these estimations, in agreement with the Commission. In case of modification, the objectives of 31 December 1991 will be adopted.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES\nThe following measures should be implemented to achieve the objectives set out above:\n- reduction in the overall capacity of the fleet of at least 9 124 GRT and 34 684 kW through a cutback of 1 474 GRT and 5 616 kW for all vessels of up to 12 metres and of 7 650 GRT and 29 068 kW for all vessels equal to or greater than 12 metres.\nIV. COMMENTS\n1. The objectives recorded in the table for point II (2) can only be revised on the basis of exact scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. It may be possible to consider a certain increase in the individual tonnage and average engine power of vessels in the Irish coastal fleet during the course of the implementation of the programme for reasons of navigating safety and to improve working conditions and the conservation of existing stocks in coastal areas. Such an increase, where appropriate, would have to be in line with the available stocks likely to be fished by that fleet.\n3. At least 20 % of the programme objectives should be achieved by the end of 1988 and at least 80 % by the end of 1990.\n4. The Commission recalls that any structural financial measures taken by the national; regional or local authorities in respect of the sector concerned must henceforth lie within the scope of this programme."}
