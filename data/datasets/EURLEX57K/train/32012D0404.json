Failure to respect this deadline will limit the possibilities of funds being committed from the 10th EDF.\nWe should like to recall the importance which the European Union attaches to the holding of credible, free and transparent parliamentary elections as quickly as possible and under optimum conditions, marking the end of the transition in the Republic of Guinea. The European Union confirms its commitment to supporting the organisation of these elections.\nWe assure you, Sirs, of the European Union\u2019s support to your efforts to ensure sustainable economic growth and the welfare of the people of the Republic of Guinea.\nYours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Council\nC.
