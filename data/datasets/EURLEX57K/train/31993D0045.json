Community financial support may be granted for pilot combined transport schemes which run on existing routes or routes still to be established and which:\n- try out measures:\n- to improve the organization and operation of combined transport services on these routes,\n- to integrate operators into the entire logistic chain, in a way which involves all operators,\n- evaluate whether measures of this kind make it possible ultimately to achieve effective combined transport services which can compete with road haulage and are economically viable.\n2. The financing of pilot schemes shall be spread over a five-year period.", "1. For the purposes of this Decision, combined transport shall mean the transport between the Member States of road vehicles, containers or demountable bodies, without unloading the goods and using at least two modes of transport from among  road, rail and inland waterways.\n2. Where a sea crossing is the only possible means of access to Community territory for a given region of the Community, this sea route may be covered by the pilot scheme.\n3. Pilot schemes may also cover combined transport routes outside the Community where this is justified by a large volume of traffic going to, or coming from, the Community.", "1. Financial support may be provided for:\n- preliminary studies on aspects common to all projects,\n- feasibility studies on a specific pilot route,\n- innovatory schemes aimed at improving the quality of the service.\n2. The Commission shall finance pilot schemes as follows:\n- up to 100 % for a preliminary study,\n- up to 50 % for a feasibility study,\n- up to 30 % for innovatory schemes.", "The Community's financial support shall be granted on the basis of a contract concluded between the Commission and each beneficiary.", "The procedures for submitting, selecting and evaluating projects are set out in the Annex."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1992.\nFor the Commission\nKarel VAN MIERT\nMember of the Commission\n(1) Note from the General Secretariat of the Council No 9832/90 of 12 November 1990.\nANNEX\nConditions governing the granting of Community financial support for combined transport pilot schemes  1. Timescale\nThe financing of the pilot schemes shall cover a five-year period (1992 to 1996).\n2. Presentation procedure\nThe proposal for a pilot scheme shall be presented to the Commission by a Member State or by a private or public enterprise. The proposal may be presented jointly by a number of Member States or enterprises.\n3. Selection criteria\n(a) The proposal for a pilot scheme must be approved by the Member States on whose territory the combined transport route covered by the pilot scheme is situated.\n(b) The Commission shall examine the proposals on the basis of the following criteria:\n- the importance of the route at European level,\n- the impact on goods traffic and the possibilities of road traffic being diverted to combined transport,\n- the cost of the proposed measures,\n- the proposed level and type of cooperation between the project partners,\n- the possibility and advisability of extending the pilot scheme to other combined transport services,\n- observance of the rules on competition and subsidies.\n4. Decision to grant financing\nThe Commission shall decide to finance the project in accordance with the criteria listed in point 3 and after consulting a group of experts designated by the Member States."}
