whereas these activities should be coordinated more closely so as to ensure that they are consistent;\n(6) Whereas, in order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work avoided, the Commission is to ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; whereas it will systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects;\n(7) Whereas coordination of the Community instruments for international action in the energy sector and other similar international programmes should be reinforced;\n(8) Whereas, by reason of their wide-ranging nature, the principal objectives of this programme can be attained best at Community level;\n(9) Whereas it is necessary to establish a specific legal instrument for the Community's international cooperation activities in the field of energy policy;\n(10) Whereas provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998-2002) adopted by Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom (5) for a specific programme for reinforcement of international cooperation in the energy field; whereas this specific programme would replace Council Regulation (EC) No 701/97 of 14 April 1997 amending a programme to promote international cooperation in the energy sector - Synergy programme (6);\n(11) Whereas, according to the resolution of 8 July 1996, political and trade relations are essential components of energy policy and, accordingly, the Community's international energy cooperation measures should be integrated more effectively in its external policy as a whole;\n(12) Whereas the objectives of energy cooperation pursuant to this programme should be to improve the competitiveness of Community businesses, to enhance security of supply, to promote sustainable development and to improve energy efficiency; whereas such cooperation may be put into effect by cooperating in, and co-financing, projects;\n(13) Whereas such cooperation should be anchored in an indicative programme and may be the subject of agreements with the States concerned or with international networks of study and research centres;\n(14) Whereas, since the cooperation in question is external cooperation, it is governed by the special provisions laid down in Title IX of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (7);\n(15) Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 (8), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of this programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty;

The Synergy programme will implement actions in line with its objectives and ensure closer coordination of international cooperation activities in the field of energy policy being conducted elsewhere in the Community.\nI. AREAS OF COOPERATION LINKED TO THE COMMUNITY'S ENERGY OBJECTIVES\nA. Activities pursuant to all three objectives:\n- advising third countries on energy policy,\n- encouraging energy efficiency in third countries,\n- developing local and, in particular, renewable energy sources,\n- encouraging regional energy integration,\n- promoting consistency in the implementation of Community programmes in specific regions (e.g. the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and the Persian Gulf regions).\nB. Competitiveness:\n- supporting the development of cooperation designed to strengthen the presence of European players on key markets in the energy sector, in particular Asia and Latin America,\n- advising third countries on organisation of the energy sector,\n- supporting liberalisation and opening-up of the energy sector, helping third countries to draw up energy policies in this new situation, in particular in conformity with the Energy Charter Treaty,\n- favouring greater investment by European undertakings in the energy sector in third countries.\nC. Security of supply:\n- conducting dialogue with energy-producing and exporting countries: Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea, Russia, producer countries in America, Asia and Africa,\n- encouraging dialogue between the European Community and the countries which have signed the Energy Charter Treaty, in particular with the transit and energy-producing transit countries, by helping to implement the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty,\n- participation in, and support for, the work of international bodies in this sector: ministerial and producer/consumer conferences, International Energy Agency,\n- providing support in creating a favourable environment for investment in third countries in the production and transit of energy, in conformity with international law, particularly the Energy Charter Treaty and the disciplines agreed within the WTO.\nD. Protection of the environment:\n- training decision-makers and staff in the energy industry in third countries in environmental awareness,\n- disseminating the Community's experience and information on energy and the environment,\n- encouraging use of clean technology, in particular for the combustion of coal in major consumers such as China, taking the implications for energy policy into account,\n- strengthening and supporting efforts to have environmental aspects taken into account in third countries' energy policy and planning,\n- encouraging and helping third countries to plan and implement national energy supply and use policies in keeping with each different environmental situation.\nII. GEOGRAPHICAL PRIORITIES AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE COMMUNITY'S INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION PROGRAMMES\nA. Role and priorities:\nIn international relations in the energy field, the Synergy programme will:\n- promote energy cooperation vis-\u0102\u00a0-vis third countries,\n- aim at having its objectives taken into account in the external cooperation activities carried out by other Community programmes,\n- facilitate the emergence of energy projects financed by other Community cooperation instruments.\nB. Geographical priority areas:\nThe Synergy programme will concentrate on the geographical priorities in the Community's external relations and help achieve certain of those priorities.\nThe areas given priority by the Synergy programme are:\n- central and eastern Europe,\n- newly Independent States (NIS),\n- Mediterranean third countries,\n- Latin America: emphasis will be placed on Mercosur, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela,\n- Asia: China, India and the ASEAN countries,\n- Africa."}
