Experience in implementing that Decision has shown that less than one project in twenty involves the deployment of a service, the remainder being deployment-related studies. As a result, the direct impact of aid granted for trans-European telecommunications networks is limited.\n(3) The cost of deploying a trans-European service based on electronic data communications networks is significantly greater than the cost of a comparable service in a single Member State because of barriers of language, culture, legislation and administration.\n(4) The cost of a preparatory study for a service in the telecommunications sector has been found to be a high proportion of the total investment required to deploy the service, and as a result the maximum contribution allowable under Regulation (EC) No\u00a02236/95 is applied to such studies, precluding the grant of aid to the deployment of services. Consequently, grant of aid under that Regulation has had little direct effect in stimulating the deployment of services.\n(5) Community aid should be granted in preference to projects which aim to stimulate the deployment of services and thus make the greatest contribution to the development of the information society. It is necessary therefore to increase the maximum contribution in proportion to the actual costs arising from the trans-European nature of a service. An increase in the Community contribution should, however, be applied only to services of public interest which must overcome the barriers of language, culture, legislation and administration,", "main_body": ["The following subparagraph shall be added to Article\u00a05(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02236/95:\n\u2018In the case of projects of common interest identified in Annex\u00a0I to Decision No\u00a01336/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17\u00a0June 1997 on a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks\u00a0(5), the total amount of Community aid granted under this Regulation may reach 30\u00a0% of the total investment cost.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 6\u00a0July 2005.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
