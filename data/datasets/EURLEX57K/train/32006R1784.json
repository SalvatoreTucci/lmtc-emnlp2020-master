More specifically, Decision XVII/7 adds CTC to the revised Table A for Decision X/14 as the processing agent for the production of radio-labelled cyanocobalamin which is a medical drug used for the diagnosis of the likely causes of vitamin B12 deficiency.\n(3) At present, the use of CTC as processing agent for the production of radio-labelled cyanocobalamin is banned in the Community under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000. In order for this particular use to be allowed, in accordance with the abovementioned Decision recently agreed upon under the Montreal Protocol, Annex VI of the Regulation should be amended.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2006.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 244, 29.9.2000, p. 1.
