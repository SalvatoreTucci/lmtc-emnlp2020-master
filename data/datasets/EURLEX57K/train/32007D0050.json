It enables Member States, both those wishing to avail themselves for the first time of the facility provided for, and those wishing to change the list of services to which they have applied the said provision in the past, to submit their request to the Commission.\n(3) This is intended to make it possible for all Member States to take part under the same conditions in the trial of reduced rates for labour-intensive services.
