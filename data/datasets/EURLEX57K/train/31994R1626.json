whereas, furthermore, the management system introduced by this Regulation covers operations relating to the fishing of Mediterranean stocks carried out by vessels flying the flag of a third country in Community ports;\nWhereas gear which, when used in the Mediterranean, contributes excessively to the degradation of the marine environment or to the running-down of certain stocks should be prohibited; whereas part of the coastal zone should be reserved for the most selective gear used by small-scale fishermen, whereas, notwithstanding the geographical scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86 of 7 October 1986 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (4), the provisions of that Regulation concerning drifting gill nets and purse seines are already applicable in the Mediterranean;\nWhereas it is appropriate to define the characteristics of the main types of fishing gear used in the Mediterranean, in particular minimum mesh sizes, as well as minimum sizes for certain species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other fishery products specific to the Mediterranean in order to prevent their over-exploitation;\nWhereas, likewise, in order to avoid situations in which large numbers of undersized individuals are caught, it is necessary to protect certain zones where juveniles congregate, taking account of the local biological conditions in these various zones; whereas it is furthermore appropriate that, when regulating fisheries in the Mediterranean, both Community and national legislation should take into account the special needs of particular species and environments recognized to be fragile or endangered;\nWhereas, in order not to impede scientific research, this Regulation should not apply to any operations required for the purposes of such research;\nWhereas national measures supplementary to, or going beyond the minimum requirements of, the system established by this Regulation or measures regulating the relationships between those engaged in fishing activities should remain possible; whereas such measures may be maintained or introduced, subject to review by the Commission as regards their compatibility with Community law and their conformity with the common fisheries policy;\nWhereas, for a limited period and according to a procedure which ensures a minimum negative effect on resources and on the activities of Community fishermen, national measures authorized by the provisions of this Regulation should be accepted;\nWhereas Article 2 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture (5), obliges Member States to ensure that non-commercial fisheries activities do not jeopardize the conservation and management of resources covered by the common fisheries policy; whereas this obligation is of particular importance in the Mediterranean owning to the considerable extent of such activities in that sea and whereas it is important to limit any negative affects thereof on the state of stocks;\nWhereas the Community is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which contains principles and rules governing the conservation and management of marine biological resources,", "main_body": ["1.

If more than one method of measuring size is permitted, the fish, crustacean or mollusc shall be deemed of the required size if at least one of the stipulated measurements is greater than the relevant minimum size.\n2.
