Ltd made a request to the competent authorities of Ireland to place bovine lactoferrin on the market as novel food ingredient. Bovine lactoferrin is an iron binding protein from milk to be added to foods.\n(2) On 22 June 2011 the competent food assessment body of Ireland issued its initial assessment report. In this report they recommended that instead of carrying out an initial assessment an additional assessment was required, because another application concerning bovine lactoferrin was already referred to EFSA.\n(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 20 July 2011.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 22 August 2011.\n(5) On 28 June 2012 in their \u2018Scientific opinion on bovine lactoferrin\u2019\u00a0(2) EFSA came to the conclusion that bovine lactoferrin is safe under the proposed uses and use levels.\n(6) On 27 April 2012 in another \u2018Scientific opinion on bovine lactoferrin\u2019\u00a0(3) EFSA already came to the conclusion that lactoferrin was safe under the proposed uses and use levels. Therefore it appears appropriate to authorise the same uses for both applications.\n(7) Bovine lactoferrin complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Bovine lactoferrin as specified in Annex I may be placed on the market as a novel food ingredient for the uses defined and at the maximum levels established in Annex II, and without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) and Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5).", "The designation of bovine lactoferrin authorised by this Decision on the labelling of the foodstuffs containing it shall be \u2018Lactoferrin from cow\u2019s milk\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd, 33-1, Shiba 3-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8384, Japan."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nMaro\u0161 \u0160EF\u010cOVI\u010c\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(7): 2811.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(5): 2701.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 26.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 124, 20.5.2009, p. 21.\nANNEX I\nSPECIFICATIONS OF BOVINE LACTOFERRIN\nDefinition\nBovine lactoferrin (bLF) is a protein that occurs naturally in cow\u2019s milk. It is an iron-binding glycoprotein of approximately 77 kDa and consists of a single polypeptide chain of 689 amino acids.\nbLF is isolated from skimmed milk via ion exchange and subsequent ultra-filtration steps. Finally it is dried by spraying and large particles are sieved out.\nDescription: Virtually odorless, light pinkish powder\nPhysical-chemical properties of bovine lactoferrin\nMoisture less than 4,5\u00a0%\nAsh less than 1,5\u00a0%\nArsenic less than 2\u00a0mg/kg\nIron less than 350\u00a0mg/kg\nProtein more than 93,0\u00a0%\nof which bovine lactoferrin more than 95,0\u00a0%\nof which other proteins less than 5,0\u00a0%\npH (2\u00a0% solution, 20\u00a0\u00b0C) 5,2 to 7,2\nSolubility (2\u00a0% solution, 20\u00a0\u00b0C) complete\nANNEX II\nUSES OF BOVINE LACTOFERRIN (bLF)\nFood category Maximum use levels of bLF\nInfant formulae and follow on formulae (ready to drink) 100\u00a0mg/100\u00a0ml\nFoods on dairy basis intended for young children (ready to eat/drink) 200\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nProcessed cereal food (solid) 670\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nFoods for special medical purposes Depending on the needs of the individual up to 3\u00a0g/day\nBeverages based on milk 200\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nPowdered drink mixes based on milk (ready to drink) 330\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nBeverages based on fermented milk (including yoghurt drinks) 50\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nNon-alcoholic drinks 120\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nProducts based on yoghurt 80\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nProducts based on cheese 2\u00a0000\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nIce cream 130\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nCakes and pastries 1\u00a0000\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nCandies 750\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g\nChewing gum 3\u00a0000\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g"}
