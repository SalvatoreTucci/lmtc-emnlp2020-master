Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4) the measures should be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Consent\nWithout prejudice to other Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, written consent shall be granted by the competent authority of Spain to the placing on the market, in accordance with this Decision, of the product identified in Article 2, as notified by Monsanto Europe SA (reference C/ES/00/01).\nThe written consent shall, in accordance with Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions to which the consent is subject, which are set out in Articles 3 and 4.", "Product\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genetically modified organisms to be placed on the market as or in products, hereinafter \u2018the product\u2019, are grains of maize (Zea mays L.), with increased tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, derived from the maize line NK603 transformation event, which has been transformed using particle acceleration technology with a MluI restriction fragment isolated from plasmid PV-ZMGT32L and which contains the following DNA sequences in two intact cassettes:\n(a) cassette 1:\n(b) cassette 2:\nThe MluI restriction fragment, which contains the two cassettes specified in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, does not contain the neomycin phosphotransferase type II gene conferring resistance to certain aminoglycoside antibiotics or the origin of replication from Escherichia coli, although both sequences are present in the original plasmid PV-ZMGT32L.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unique identifier of the product is MON-00603-6.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent shall cover grains from progeny derived from crosses of maize line NK603 with any traditionally bred maize as or in products.", "Conditions for placing on the market\nThe product may be used as any other maize, with the exception of cultivation and uses as or in food, and may be placed on the market subject to the following conditions:\n(a) the period of validity of the written consent shall be for a period of 10 years;\n(b) the unique identifier of the product shall be MON-00603-6 in accordance with Article 2(2);\n(c) without prejudice to Article 25 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the consent holder shall make control samples available to the competent authorities on request;\n(d) the words \u2018This product contains genetically modified organisms\u2019 or \u2018This product contains genetically modified maize\u2019 shall appear either on a label or in a document accompanying the product, save where other Community legislation sets a threshold below which such information is not required;\n(e) as long as the product has not been authorised for the placing on the market for the purpose of cultivation, the words \u2018not for cultivation\u2019 shall appear either on a label or in a document accompanying the product.", "Monitoring\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the period of validity of the consent, the consent holder is responsible for ensuring that the general surveillance plan, as contained in the notification, for any adverse effects on human health or the environment arising from handling or use of the product is put in place and implemented.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent holder shall directly inform the operators and users concerning the safety and general characteristics of the product and of the conditions as to general surveillance.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent holder shall, throughout the period of validity of the consent, without prejudice to Article 20 of Directive 2001/18/EC, submit to the Commission and to competent authorities of the Member States, annual reports on the results of the general surveillance and, in the light of the results, proposals for a revised monitoring plan.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent holder shall be in the position to give evidence to the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States that:\n(a) the surveillance networks, particularly those specified in table 1 of the monitoring plan contained in the notification, collect the information relevant for the general surveillance of the product;
