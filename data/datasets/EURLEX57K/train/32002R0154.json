Since the 1994/1995 harvest, the production and export of seeds has increased constantly; moreover, stocks of seeds in the Community have reached a level likely to affect the balance of the market in seeds.\n(2) It is therefore justified to introduce a mechanism to stabilise the production of seeds other than rice seeds, for which such a mechanism is already in place. The stabiliser mechanism for seeds other than rice seeds should set a maximum quantity eligible for aid determined on the basis of a representative average quantity harvested during a recent reference period and also a margin to take account of the cyclic fluctuations that are characteristic of seed production. It is also necessary to create the conditions that will allow the development or preservation of viable small production sectors by guaranteeing a minimum quantity for Member States where there is little or no seed production.\n(3) The Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 refers to the varieties of Lolium perenne L. of high persistence, late or medium late, new and other varieties and varieties of low persistence, medium late, medium early or early. Since the prices for those varieties on the external markets no longer justify that distinction, the distinction between three different groups of varieties of Lolium perenne L. should therefore be abolished and a single rate of aid fixed.\n(4) Given the situation on and the outlook for the Community market, producers are not assured of a fair return from seeds listed in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 which will be marketed in the 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 marketing years. Production aid should be granted for those seeds.\n(5) Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 provides that when the aid is fixed, account should be taken, on the one hand, of the need to ensure balance between production in the Community and the outlets for such production and, on the other hand, of the prices for such products on the external markets.\n(6) The application of these criteria results in fixing the aid applicable for the 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 marketing years at the levels set out in the Annex.\n(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
