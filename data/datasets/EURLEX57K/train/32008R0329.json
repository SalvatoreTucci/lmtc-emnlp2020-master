However, under Article\u00a08(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01083/2006\u00a0(3), which lays down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the French regions of Corsica and Hainault cannot, as from 2007, benefit from the transitional aid provided for in that Article. Consequently, the national premium supplementing the suckler cow premium provided for in Article\u00a0125(5) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01782/2003 and granted to holdings situated in the French regions of Corsica and Hainault cannot be financed by the EAGF as from 1 January 2007. In order to ensure continued Community support for suckler cows, France has requested that an amount corresponding to the payments made under the additional national premium in Corsica and Hainault up to 2006 be transferred from the ceiling set for 2007 in Annex\u00a0I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0552/2007 for the additional national premium to the ceiling set in that Annex for the suckler cow premium. The abovementioned budgetary ceilings should therefore be adjusted.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0552/2007 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0552/2007 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) the amount for the \u2018Suckler cow premium\u2019 for France is replaced by \u2018734\u00a0416\u2019;\n(b) the amount for the \u2018Additional suckler cow premium\u2019 for France is replaced by \u20180\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
