By a letter dated 21 September 2009, the Commission notified Austria that it had all the information that it deemed necessary to consider the request.\n(3) With a view to simplifying the levying of value added tax (VAT), the derogating measure is intended to exclude completely from the right of deduction VAT borne on goods and services when those goods and services are used for more than 90\u00a0% for the private purposes of the taxable person or of his employees, or for non-business purposes in general.\n(4) The measure derogates from Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC establishing the general principle of the right of deduction and is intended to simplify the procedure for charging VAT. The amount of tax due at the final consumption is only affected to a negligible extent.\n(5) The legal and factual situation which justified the current application of the simplification measure in question has not changed, and continues to exist. Austria should therefore be authorised to apply the simplification measure during a further period, but limited in time in order to allow an evaluation of the measure.\n(6) The derogation will not adversely affect the Union's own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Austria is authorised to exclude VAT borne on goods and services from the right to deduct when the goods and services in question are used more than 90\u00a0% for the private purposes of a taxable person or of his employees, or, more generally, for non-business purposes.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2012.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Austria."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
