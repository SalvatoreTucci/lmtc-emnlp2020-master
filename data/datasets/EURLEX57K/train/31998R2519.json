The representative cif import prices for barley, maize and, in the case of common wheat and durum wheat, for each standard quality shall be the sum of components (a), (b) and (c) indicated by the Commission in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.\nHowever, the representative cif import prices for imports of barley, maize and, in the case of common wheat and durum wheat, each standard quality that are made:\n- overland or by river,\n- by sea on vessels arriving in the Community from ports located in the Mediterranean, Black Sea or Baltic Sea,\nshall be reduced by ECU 10 per tonne. In this case the import duty reductions provided for in Article 2(4) shall not be applicable.\nIn cases where third countries grant subsidies on exports of standard medium or low quality common wheat to European or Mediterranean basin countries so that world market prices can be undercut the Commission may take account of these subsidies in establishing the representative cif price for importation into the Community.`;\n2. Annex I is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation;\n3. the last subparagraph of Article 6(1) is replaced by the following:\n'The goods shall be classed in the standard quality for which all the requirements indicated in Annex I are met.
