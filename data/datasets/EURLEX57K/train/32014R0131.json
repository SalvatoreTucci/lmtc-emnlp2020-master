The respective requirement that compounds with a high dusting potential must be placed on the market in a pelleted form could be expanded to other non-powder forms without compromising the risk for the users.\n(5) The applicant for coated granulated cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate submitted data in order to substantiate that the substance coated is cobalt(II) carbonate and not cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate. After verification in the application dossier which was the basis for the above mentioned opinion of the Authority\u00a0(6), it appears necessary to change the authorisation terms of this product accordingly.\n(6) As a result of the granting of new authorisations by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2003\u00a0(7) concerning cobaltous acetate tetrahydrate, basic cobaltous carbonate monohydrate and cobaltous sulphate heptahydrate are obsolete and should be deleted.\n(7) As a consequence of these modifications, the transitional period provided for in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013 should be extended in order to allow interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the requirements resulting from the amendments. As regards feed intended for pet animals, the market consists in a huge number of different products with a specific labelling system. It is therefore appropriate to prolong such a transitional period in order to allow a smooth transition for the feed business operators concerned.\n(8) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) In addition, a transitional period for operators who applied the provisions of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013 should be established.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 601/2013 shall be amended as follows:\n1.
