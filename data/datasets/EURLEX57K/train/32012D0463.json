Under the terms of that framework mandate, the Agency was requested to revise the TSIs on high-speed rolling stock, freight wagons, locomotives and passenger rolling stock, noise, infrastructure, energy, control-command and signalling, operation and traffic management, telematic applications for freight and passenger services, safety on railway tunnels and accessibility to persons with reduced mobility.\n(3) On 31 March 2011, the Agency issued a recommendation on the specification of the register of infrastructure, the procedure of demonstrating the level of compliance with the basic parameters of the TSIs for existing lines, and subsequent amendments to TSIs (ERA/REC/04-2011/INT).\n(4) On 9 June 2011, the Committee established in accordance with Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC gave a positive opinion on the draft Commission Implementing Decision on the European register of authorised types of railway vehicles and on the draft Commission Implementing Decision on the common specifications of the register of railway infrastructure. Following the adoption of these two Commission acts based on these drafts, namely Commission Implementing Decision 2011/633/EU of 15 September 2011 on the common specifications of the register of railway infrastructure\u00a0(5) and Commission Implementing Decision 2011/665/EU of 4 October 2011 on the European register of authorised types of railway vehicles\u00a0(6), the relevant TSIs need to be updated to ensure global consistency.\n(5) For practical reasons, it is preferable to amend a series of TSIs by a single Commission Decision to implement particular corrections and updates in the legal texts. These corrections and updates are not arising from a global revision of the TSIs or from the extension of their geographical scope.\n(6) It is therefore necessary to amend the following Decisions:\n\u2014 Commission Decision 2006/679/EC of 28 March 2006 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the control-command and signalling subsystem of the trans-European conventional rail system\u00a0(7), and\n\u2014 Commission Decision 2006/860/EC of 7 November 2006 concerning a technical specification for interoperability relating to the control-command and signalling subsystem of the trans-European high speed rail system and modifying Annex A to Decision 2006/679/EC concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the control-command and signalling subsystem of the trans-European conventional rail system\u00a0(8).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 29(1) of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2006/679/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "The Annex to Decision 2006/860/EC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 24 January 2013.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nSiim KALLAS\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 18.7.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 164, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 110, 20.4.2001, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 256, 1.10.2011, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 264, 8.10.2011, p. 32.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 284, 16.10.2006, p. 1.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 342, 7.12.2006, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe Annex to Decision 2006/679/EC (CR CCS TSI) is amended as follows:\n(1) In clause 2.2.4, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(2) In clause 4.3.2.5 \u2018Physical environmental conditions\u2019, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(3) Clause 4.3.3.3 is replaced by the following:\n(4) In Section 4.8, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(5) Clause 6.2.1 \u2018Assessment procedures\u2019 is amended as follows:\n(a) the eighth and ninth paragraphs are deleted;\n(b) the 10th paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(6) In clause 6.2.1.3 \u2018Assessment in migration phases\u2019, the sixth paragraph is deleted.\n(7) In clause 6.2.2.3 \u2018Conditions for use of modules for on-board and track-side assemblies\u2019, sub-clause \u2018On-board assembly validation\u2019, the third paragraph is replaced by the following:\n(8) In clause 7.4.2.1 \u2018Category of each specific case is given in Annex A, Appendix 1\u2019, in the table, the justifications of items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13 and 15 are replaced by the following:\n(a) for item 1: \u2018Existing axle counter equipment\u2019\n(b) for item 3: \u2018Relevant on lines with level crossing\u2019\n(c) for items 4 and 5: \u2018Existing track circuit equipment\u2019\n(d) for item 6: \u2018Existing axle counter equipment\u2019\n(e) for item 7: \u2018Minimum axle load necessary to shunt certain track circuits is determined in a requirement of EBA (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt), relevant on some main lines in Germany in the area of former DR (Deutsche Reichsbahn) with 42\u00a0Hz and 100\u00a0Hz track circuits.
