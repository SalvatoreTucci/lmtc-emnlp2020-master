It also provides for the designation of national avian influenza laboratories and a Community reference laboratory for avian influenza.\n(2) Commission Decision 2005/237/EC of 15 March 2005 on financial aid from the Community for the operation of certain Community reference laboratories in the field of animal health and live animals in 2005\u00a0(3) granted Community financial aid to the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza designated in Directive 92/40/EEC.\n(3) Recent developments in the animal health situation concerning avian influenza in the Community and third countries have lead to a substantial increase in the amount of work to be carried out by the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza in relation to that disease. The increase is mainly due to the characterisation of viruses submitted to the laboratory and the production and updating of the current panel of reagents and their distribution.\n(4) In addition, the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza plays a key role in supporting the diagnostic units in the national reference avian influenza laboratories, including visits to those laboratories.\n(5) The enlargement of the arsenal of available diagnostic, such as the validation of new molecular diagnostic techniques and methodology, issuing of standards and running the inter-laboratory tests that has been added to the functions and duties of the approved work programme for 2005 has incremented the activity carried out in the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza.\n(6) The Commission has analysed the recent information provided by the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza on the expenditure required for 2005. Taking into account that information, the Community\u2019s financial contribution to that laboratory needs to be adjusted and it is therefore appropriate to allocate additional funding for 2005.\n(7) Decision 2005/237/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 3 of Decision 2005/237/EC, \u2018EUR\u00a0135\u00a0000\u2019 is replaced by \u2018EUR\u00a0285\u00a0000\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.
