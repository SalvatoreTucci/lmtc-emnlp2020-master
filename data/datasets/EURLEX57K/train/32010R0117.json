Studies and tests carried out in the framework of that examination indicate that the determination of the starch (or dextrin) content by hydrolysis by means of sodium hydroxide and the determination of the glucose content using the enzymatic method with spectrophotometry as prescribed for most goods now, do not meet any longer the current technical requirements and are therefore to be updated.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to provide that the determination of starch (or dextrin) content is to be carried out in an enzymatic way by amylase and amyloglucosidase and that the glucose content is to be determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as set out in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 900/2008 of 16 September 2008 laying down the methods of analysis and other technical provisions necessary for the application of the arrangements for imports of certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products\u00a0(4) as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 118/2010\u00a0(5).\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 904/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 904/2008, point 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
