The following Article 1a is inserted:\n'Article 1a\nThe use of the following methods is hereby authorized for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in Northern Ireland:\n- the apparatus termed \"Intrascope (Optical Probe)\" and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of Annex IA,\n- the apparatus termed \"Mark II Ulster Probe\" and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of Annex IA.'\n2. Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 2\nNotwithstanding the standard presentation referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, pig carcases may be presented in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with the tongue attached before being weighted and graded. In order to establish quotations for pig carcases on a comparable basis, the recorded hot weight shall be reduced by 0,3 kg.'\n3. Article 3 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 3\nNotwithstanding Article 2 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 the weight of the cold carcase shall be calculated in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by reference to the scale of absolute reductions of the warm weight shown in Annex II.'\n4.

Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Intrascope (Optical Probe)\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 millimetres (and of 19 millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres and having an operating distance of between 3 and 45 millimetres.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n1.2 // y =   // 57,1  0,65x1 + 0,170x2  0,41x3  1,2 // or 1.2 // y =   // 57,5  1,07x1 + 0,158x2  1,2 // where: 1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,  // x1 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as \"P2\"),   // x2 =  // the weight of the cold carcase in kg,   // x3 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs (measurement known as ''rib-fat\").\nThe two formulae shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms.\nPART 2\nMark II Ulster Probe\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \"Mark II Ulster Probe\".\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with an oval-shaped probe of a maximum width of 11 millimetres containing an infra-red light-emitting photodiode (TFK type TS-US 5402) with a peak wave-length frequency of 950 nm and a matching infra-red photodetector (TRW Optron type OP 500) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 50 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean mean content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to one of the following two formulae:\n1.2 // y =   // 56,8  0,69x1 + 0,185x2  0,43x3  1,2 // or 1.2 // y =   // 56,2  1,12x1 + 0,185x2  1,2 // where: 1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,  // x1 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib (measurement known as ''P2''),   // x2 =   // the weight of the cold carcase in kg,   // x3 =   // the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs (measurement known as \"rib-fat\").\nThe formulae shall be valid for carcases weighing between 30 and 120 kilograms."}
