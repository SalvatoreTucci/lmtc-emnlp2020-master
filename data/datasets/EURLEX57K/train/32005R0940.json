The impending adjustment of the refunds applicable to those products has led to the submission of applications for export licences for speculative ends. There is a risk that the issue of licences for the quantities applied for from 13 to 17 June and 20 June 2005 may lead to an overrun in the quantities of the products concerned normally disposed of by way of trade.
