Research and development projects concerning the following subjects:\nProject No 1: Long-term integrity of buildings and systems;\nProject No 2: Decontamination for decommissioning purposes;\nProject No 3: Dismantling techniques;\nProject No 4: Treatment of specific waste materials: steel, concrete and graphite;\nProject No 5: Large containers for radioactive waste produced in the dismantling of nuclear installations;\nProject No 6: Estimation of the quantities of radioactive wastes arising from the decommissioning of nuclear installations in the Community;\nProject No 7: Influence of installation design features on decommissioning.\nB. Identification of guiding principles, namely:\n- certain guiding principles in the design and operation of nuclear installations with a view to simplifying their subsequent decommissioning,\n- guiding principles in the decommissioning of nuclear installations which could form theinitial elements of a Community policy in this field.\nC. Testing of new techniques under real conditions, within the framework of large-scale decommissioning operations undertaken in Member States."}
