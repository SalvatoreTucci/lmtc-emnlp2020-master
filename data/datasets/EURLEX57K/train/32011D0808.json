The European Union would point out that it remains ready to back the transition process and support it politically and financially, should it be called on to do so by the SADC and the African Union (AU), and in close cooperation with the international community.The European Union is ready to intensify the political dialogue with the transition authorities emerging from the implementation of the roadmap in order to examine the conditions and detailed arrangements for support.\nIn accordance with Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the roadmap, the appointment of the consensus prime minister and the transitional government are crucial steps in the implementation of the process since they are responsible for creating the necessary conditions for the holding of credible, fair and transparent elections, in cooperation with the international community.\nPolitical and financial support from the European Union is subject to the Malagasy party's fulfilling the commitments set out below:\nCommitments of the Malagasy party Commitments of the European Union\nSigning of the roadmap Statement by the spokesperson of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) (welcoming the signing and expressing willingness to offer political and financial support for implementation of the transition, subject to its being carried out)\nIdentification/formulation of programmes to support vulnerable sections of the population (Health, education and nutrition programme, Programme of support for civil society, Food security and rural infrastructure programme, Labour-intensive rural roads programme) under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) for around EUR 100\u00a0million and budget lines\nAppointment of the consensus prime minister and transitional government of national unity Recognition of the legitimacy of Madagascar's interim President and government, opening the door to the presentation of credentials by the EU's ambassador to Madagascar\nSetting up a transitional parliament and independent national electoral commission (CENI) and drafting and implementing a credible electoral framework with United Nations (UN) support (electoral evaluation report) If the report of the UN electoral assessment mission is deemed satisfactory and the electoral timetable realistic:\n\u2014 Inclusion of Madagascar in the list of priority countries for an EU election observation mission in 2012, thus confirming the Union's willingness to send an EU election observation mission, depending on available funds and following the results of an exploratory mission\n\u2014 Formulation of electoral support measures using various instruments, in particular the stability instrument, taking into account available financial resources\nAdoption of an amnesty law ratified by the interim parliament and adoption by the said parliament of a law laying down the conditions for implementing the resignation of the interim president, the prime minister and members of the interim government if they decide to stand for election Identification/formulation of measures to support national reconciliation and democratisation\nHolding of parliamentary and presidential elections Sending an EU election observation mission, depending on available funds\nProclamation of the election results Statement by HR on the conduct and results of the elections and assessment of their credibility\nNew president, government and parliament take up their functions and the country returns to constitutional order EU statement by the HR and the Commissioner for development welcoming the return to constitutional order and confirming the full normalisation of relations between the EU and Madagascar and complete resumption of development cooperation\nWe urge you and all Malagasy political stakeholders to persevere in your efforts to implement the roadmap as soon as possible so that the EU can support the consensus-based, neutral transition process to help Madagascar emerge from the crisis.\nThe European Union has decided to replace the appropriate measures set out in the letter annexed to Decision 2010/371/EUwith the following appropriate measures:\n\u2014 humanitarian and emergency aid is not affected,\n\u2014 the European Commission will implement certain projects and programmes that directly benefit the population,\n\u2014 budgetary aid provided for in the 9th and 10th EDF NIPs will remain suspended,\n\u2014 projects and programmes already under way under the 9th EDF will continue to be implemented, except for activities and payments directly involving the government and its agencies; a revision may be possible in the light of developments in the political situation.
