There are presently no areas listed in that Annex.\n(4) On the basis of the evolution of the animal health situation in Cyprus, and in particular the favourable results of the ongoing surveillance, it is now possible to define those areas that should be included in Annex III to Decision 2007/718/EC.\n(5) It is also necessary in view of the current animal health situation to extend the validity of Decision 2007/718/EC until 31 January 2008.\n(6) Decision 2007/718/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/718/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
