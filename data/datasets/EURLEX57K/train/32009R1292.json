The quantity of sorghum imported into Spain which can be classified as part of the reduced import duty quota is negligible. The quantity of maize imported into Portugal which can be classified as part of the reduced import duty quota covers only 13\u00a0% of the quota. In view of the market conditions in Spain and Portugal, opening invitations to tender until 17 December 2009 is not likely to enable sufficient quantities to cover the quotas to be imported.\n(3) Therefore the invitations to tender for the reduction in the duty on maize and sorghum imported into Spain and maize imported into Portugal should be extended until the end of May 2010 to enable import quotas to be fully used up.\n(4) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 675/2009, Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 676/2009 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 677/2009, invitations to tender shall be open until 27 May 2010.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall expire on 28 May 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 December 2009.\nFor the Commission,\nOn behalf of the President,\nNeelie KROES\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 196, 28.7.2009, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 196, 28.7.2009, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0196, 28.7.2009, p.\u00a07.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0340, 19.12.2008, p.\u00a057."}
