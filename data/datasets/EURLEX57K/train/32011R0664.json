Taking into account those comments, the Commission selected a list of mixtures of wastes classified under one single Basel entry for inclusion in Annex IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.\n(4) The Commission assessed the requests by Finland and the United Kingdom and the comments of Member States and on the basis of that assessment, a list of mixtures of wastes classified under individual Basel entries for inclusion in Annex IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 was selected.\n(5) It is important to clarify which procedures are applicable to shipments of mixtures of wastes classified under one single Basel entry. In order to allow the export of some of those mixtures of wastes to countries to which Decision C(2001) 107/Final of the OECD Council concerning the revision of Decision C(92) 39/Final on control of transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations (the OECD Decision) does not apply using the general information requirements laid down in Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, a transitional period for those countries is necessary before they can inform the Commission, whether relevant mixtures of wastes may be exported to that country and of the applicable control procedure, if any.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Annex IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever, in the case of exports to countries to which the OECD Decision does not apply, point 3 of Annex IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, as amended by this Regulation, shall apply as of 1 August 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 July 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0190, 12.7.2006, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0312, 22.11.2008, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\nAnnex IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) point 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
