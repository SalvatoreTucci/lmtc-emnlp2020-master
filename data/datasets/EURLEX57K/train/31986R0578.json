On acceptance of the declaration of export from Spain to a third country, Portugal or a Member State of the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 of maize, falling within subheading 10.05 B of the Common Customs Tariff, a charge shall be made for any operation carried out between 1 March 1986 and the end of the 1985/86 marketing year.\n2. The amount of the charge per tonne shall be the difference between the threshold price for maize in February 1986 minus the accession compensatory amount applicable on 1 March and the entry price in Spain for this type of cereal in February 1986. The threshold price and the accession compensatory amount shall be converted into pesetas on the basis of the representative rate applicable on 1 March 1986.\n3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, where no export refund is set for maize, the exporter shall lodge, on acceptance of the declaration of export, a security of an amount equal to that of the charge provided for in paragraph 2. This security shall be released when the operator provides proper evidence that the merchandise exported has been released for consumption in a third country.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 March 1986.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 February 1986.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President"}
