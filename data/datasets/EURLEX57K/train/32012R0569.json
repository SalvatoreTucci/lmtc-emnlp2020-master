In order to make it easier to maintain a flow of imports conducive to EU market equilibrium, there is a need to ensure continuity in cereal imports policy by keeping the temporary suspension of customs duties on imports of common wheat during the 2012/2013 marketing year until 31\u00a0December\u00a02012 for the import tariff quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01067/2008. Given that the issue of import licences for barley has been suspended until 31\u00a0December\u00a02012, the suspension of customs duties for this product during the same period becomes unnecessary.\n(4) Moreover, traders should not be penalised in cases where cereals are en route for importation into the Union. Therefore, the time required for transport should be taken into account and traders allowed to release cereals for free circulation under the customs-duty suspension regime provided for in this Regulation, for all products whose direct transport to the Union has started at the latest on 31 December 2012. The evidence to be provided showing direct transport to the Union and the date on which the transport commenced should also be established.\n(5) In order to ensure sound management of the procedure for issuing import licences as from 1 July 2012, this Regulation should enter into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(6) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application of customs duties on imports of common wheat falling within CN code 1001\u00a099\u00a000, of a quality other than high quality as defined in Annex\u00a0II to Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0642/2010\u00a0(6), shall be suspended for the 2012/2013 marketing year for all imports under the reduced-duty tariff quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01067/2008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the cereals referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article undergo direct transport to the Union and such transport began at the latest by 31\u00a0December 2012, the suspension of customs duties under this Regulation shall continue to apply for the purposes of the release into free circulation of the products concerned.\nProof of direct transport to the Union and of the date on which the transport commenced shall be provided, to the satisfaction of the relevant authorities, by the original transport document.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 338, 21.12.2011, p. 27.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 290, 31.10.2008, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 342, 30.12.2003, p. 7.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 8, 12.1.2012, p. 35.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 187, 21.7.2010, p. 5."}
