Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that derived intervention prices for white sugar are to be fixed for each of the deficit areas; whereas, for such fixing, it is appropriate that account  be taken of the regional variations which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, might be expected to occur in the price of sugar under natural conditions of price formation on the market; Whereas a deficit supply situation is to be  foreseen in the areas of production in Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom; Whereas Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that an intervention price for raw sugar shall be fixed; whereas such price should be established on the basis of  the intervention price for white sugar; Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1912/87 fixed the basic price for beet at 40,89 ECU per tonne; whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the minimum price to be fixed for A beet shall be 98 %  of the basic price of the beet; Whereas Article 28 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that losses resulting from undertakings to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered by production levies charged on the quantities of A  and B sugar and of A and B isoglucose produced within certain ceiling limits; whereas the third subparagraph of Article 28 (5) of that Regulation permits, as from the 1986/87 marketing year, a revision of the application of a ceiling to the B levy up to  a limit of 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar; Whereas, for the 1987/88 marketing year, the levy amount to be collected will not be sufficient, according to estimates, to entirely cover the overall loss due to these undertakings; Whereas  it is therefore necessary to increase, for the 1987/88 marketing year, the maximum amount for the B levy to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar and to fix as a consequence the minimum price for B beet at 60,5 % of the basic price for beet;  Whereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the threshold price for white sugar shall be equal to the target price, plus costs, calculated at a flat rate, of transport from the Community area having the largest surplus to the  most distant deficit consumption area in the Community, plus a flat-rate amount which takes into account the storage levy; whereas, given the state of supplies within the Community, account should be taken of transport charges between the departments of  northern France and Palermo; Whereas the threshold price for raw sugar is to be derived from the threshold price for white sugar by reference to a processing margin and a standard yield; Whereas the threshold price for molasses should be fixed in such a  way that the receipts from sales of molasses may reach the level of receipts of undertakings taken into account in the fixing of basic prices for beet; Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 (5) provides that the amount of repayment in the  context of the compensation for storage costs shall be fixed per month and per unit of weight, taking account of financing, insurance and specific storage costs; Whereas, when fixing the prices to be applied in Spain and Portugal, the prices fixed for  those Member States for the 1986/87 marketing year should be aligned with the common prices in accordance with Articles 70 and 238 of the Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["For the deficit areas of the Community other than Portugal, the derived intervention price for white sugar shall be fixed, per 100 kilograms, at:(a) 55,39 ECU for all the areas in the United Kingdom;(b)55,39 ECU for all the areas in  Ireland;(c)56,12 ECU for all the areas in Italy.", "The intervention price for 100 kilograms of raw sugar shall be 44,92 ECU.", "1.
