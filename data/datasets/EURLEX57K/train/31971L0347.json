VIGLIANESI\nANNEX I STANDARD INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE THE EEC STANDARD MASS PER STORAGE VOLUME OF GRAIN\nI. CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS    1. Standard instruments consist of a capacity measure, a filling device, a scraper device, a weighing device and a filling container.\nAll parts of the instruments shall be constructed soundly and carefully ; all surfaces coming into contact with the grain shall be smooth and made of a virtually stable metal, e.g. brass, stainless steel, sufficiently thick to keep its shape during normal use.\n2. Capacity measure      2.1. The capacity measure is in the form of an upright, circular cylinder ; its upper edge is ground flat along a plane perpendicular to its axis.\n2.2. During the filling operation the capacity measure is always in the same position under the filling device.\n2.3. Above the capacity measure, when in the filling position, a filling ring is affixed which is mounted along the same axis and has the same internal diameter as the capacity measure, the scraper blade moves with a slight clearance between these two components.\n3. Filling device      3.1. The filling device consists of a filling hopper equipped with a closing device and a regulating device.\n3.2. The filling hopper is in the form of a truncated cone to which is attached an upper cylindrical part and a lower tapered discharge nozzle equipped with a closing device.\n3.3. The filling hopper is fixed in such a way that in the filling position its axis is vertical and coincides with that of the capacity measure.\n3.4. The regulating device has a closely specified profile. It projects downwards into the lower discharge nozzle and its position is adjustable in the vertical direction. Its axis coincides with that of the filling hopper.\n4. Scraper device      4.1. The scraper device consists of a scraper blade, a guide and a traction device.\n4.2. The scraper blade is flat, horizontal and keeps its shape during use.\n4.3. The guide constrains the scraper blade to move between the lower rim of the filling ring and the upper rim of the capacity measure.\n4.4. The traction device sets the scraper blade in continuous movement through the grain.\n4.5. After filling and weighing the capacity measure, the excess grain on the scraper blade in the filling ring is collected in a container.\n5. Weighing device      5.1. The capacity measure, filled with grain, is weighed on an equal arm balance of 50 kg capacity.\n5.2. The mass of the weights platform of the balance balances the empty capacity measure.\n6. General assembly      6.1. The various parts of the instrument, apart from the capacity measure and the balance, are fixed on a frame in such a way that the upper rim of the capacity measure, in the filling position, is horizontal.\n6.2. The frame of the instrument is equipped with a plumb line at least 500 mm long, or with a spirit level. These devices must be between the reference marks when the upper rim of the capacity measure, in the filling position, is horizontal.\n7. Dimensions of the various components >PIC FILE= \"T0011021\">\n8. Figure\nThe standard instrument is shown in the attached diagram\nII. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS The grain to be measured shall be free of impurities and at approximately ambient temperature. It shall be air-dried, i.e. in hygroscopic equilibrium with the ambient air. For this purpose it is spread out in a thin layer and left undisturbed for about ten hours before being transferred. The relative humidity of the ambient air shall not exceed 60 %.\nThe standard mass per storage volume depends on the quantity of grain used and the way it is transferred to the filling hopper. For this reason, the following procedure should be followed:\nPlace capacity measure 1 (see attached diagram) in the filling position so that its axis coincides with that of the filling ring 2 and the filling hopper 3, and move the lever 15 so as to lock the said measure in this position by the locking rod 16. Move the scraper blade 9 to its starting position and lock it in position with the lever 12. Use the foot screws 19 to adjust the frame 20, so that the upper rim of the capacity measure 1 is in a horizontal plane during filling.\n24 litres of grain are now put into the filling container (not shown in the diagram) and tipped into the filling hopper 3 after it has been checked that the closing device 4 of the tapered discharge nozzle 8 is in the closed position. Then draw the bolt 5 to open the closing device 4 (which is then held open by the catch 6), and let the grain flow into the capacity measure 1 standing on the carriage 14. This flow is protected against external influences by the collar 2a. The support 14a prevents deformation of the rails along which the rollers of the carriage 14 travel.\nThe excess grain (approximately 4 litres) that has been fed into the hopper 3 in order to ensure even filling of the capacity measure 1 is retained in the filling ring 2 after the measure is completely filled. To separate this excess from the contents of the capacity measure 1, open the bolt 12 which pivots on a spindle fixed on the crosspiece 11, in order to release the scraper blade 9. The front edge of the scraper blade 9, which is actuated by the traction weight 13, is sufficiently sharp to cut off any grains on the rim of the capacity measure 1 which might prevent regular scraping. When the scraper blade 9 reaches its final position, use the lever 15 to withdraw the capacity measure 1 standing on the carriage 14, remove the measure from this carriage, place it on the scales and weigh its contents to within \u00b1 5 g.\nPull back the scraper blade 9 to its starting position, so that the excess grain lying on this blade falls into the container 17 ; any stray grains are guided into the container by the jacket 18. After releasing the catch 6 by turning the handwheel 4a, shut the closing device 4.\nIf another measurement has to be made on the same sample, the grain from the capacity measure should be thoroughly mixed with that from the container.\nTo obtain the standard mass per storage volume in kg/hl, divide by 0 72 hl the value N indicated by the weighing device.\nIII. CHECKING AND ADJUSTING    1. Dimensions and volumes\nThe dimensions and volumes given under item 1 77 are checked with instruments of suitable accuracy.\n2. Checking of functioning\nNational standard instruments shall be checked against the Community standard instrument and adjusted accordingly by means of a transportable standard instrument.      2.1. For the purposes of this check pure Manitoba wheat whose grains are approximately spherical is used. It shall have a standard mass per storage volume of not less than 80 kg/hl and shall be in hygroscopic equilibrium with the ambient air. Six measuring operations are made in accordance with the instructions of item II. If P denotes the standard instrument to be checked and N the EEC standard instrument, the measurements are made as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0011022\">         2.1.1. The differences between the separate values given by P and their mean value may not exceed = 10 g.\n2.1.2. The error of the instrument is the difference between the mean value of the six readings given by P and the mean value of the six readings given by N. The maximum permissible error is = 10 g.\n2.1.3. If the maximum permissible errors specified in items 2.1.1 or 2.1.2 are exceeded, this may be because the grain is still not sufficiently homogeneous ; it  must therefore be left spread out for about another ten hours in the measuring place, after which the check described in item 2.1 is repeated.\n2.1.4. If only the maximum permissible error specified in item 2.1.2 is exceeded, the instrument must be adjusted.\nThe readings provided by the instrument can be altered by moving the regulation device 7 to a higher or lower position.\nThe regulating device 7 is moved and the check described in item 2.1 is repeated.\n3. Weighing device      3.1. For loads between 10 and 20 kg, the error of the balance must not exceed \u00b1 0 701 % of the load.\n3.2. The sum of the errors in the weights used must not exceed \u00b1 0 702 % of their nominal mass.\nLegend on attached drawing\n>PIC FILE= \"T0011023\">   >PIC FILE= \"T0011024\">\nANNEX II MEASURING INSTRUMENTS USED TO DETERMINE THE EEC STANDARD MASS PER STORAGE VOLUME OF GRAIN\n1.
