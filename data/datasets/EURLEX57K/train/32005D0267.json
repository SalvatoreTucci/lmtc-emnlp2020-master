In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(5) This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as general principles of Community law.\n(6) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(2) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3) should be taken into account in the context of the web-based intranet site.\n(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4).\n(8) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this Decision, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, except insofar as it establishes an exchange of information on the problems associated with the return of third-country nationals other than those who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for a short stay applicable within the territory of a Member State by virtue of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, Denmark, in accordance with Article 5 of the aforementioned Protocol, shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(9) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, except insofar as it establishes an exchange of information on the problems associated with the return of third-country nationals other than those who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for a short stay applicable within the territory of a Member State by virtue of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(5), which fall within the areas referred to in Article 1, points A, B, C and E of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement\u00a0(6).\n(10) As regards Switzerland, except insofar as it establishes an exchange of information on the problems associated with the return of third-country nationals other than those who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for a short stay applicable within the territory of a Member State by virtue of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(7), which fall within the areas referred to in Article 1, points A, B, C and E of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/849/EC of 25 October 2004\u00a0(8) and of Council Decision 2004/860/EC of 25 October 2004\u00a0(9) on the signing of that Agreement on behalf of the European Union and the European Community, respectively, and on the provisional application of certain provisions thereof.\n(11) An arrangement has to be made to allow representatives of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland to be associated with the work of the committee assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers pursuant to this Decision with respect to the provisions constituting a development of the Schengen acquis.\n(12) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Decision, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(10), to the extent that its measures develop provisions of the Schengen acquis against the organisation of illegal immigration in which the United Kingdom participates, and the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, having notified under Article 3 thereof its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(13) Ireland is taking part in this Decision, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning the request of Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(11), to the extent that its measures develop provisions of the Schengen acquis against the organisation of illegal immigration in which Ireland participates.\n(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application to the extent that its measures do not develop provisions of the Schengen acquis against the organisation of illegal immigration in which Ireland participates,", "main_body": ["This Decision establishes a
