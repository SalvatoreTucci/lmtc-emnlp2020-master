That list includes tolylfluanid.\n(2) Tolylfluanid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 for use in biocidal products for product-type 21, antifouling products, as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0528/2012.\n(3) Finland was designated as evaluating competent authority and submitted an assessment report, together with its recommendations, to the Commission on 18 September 2012 in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 6 of Article\u00a014 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007\u00a0(3).\n(4) The opinion of the European Chemicals Agency was formulated on 17 June 2014 by the Biocidal Product Committee, having regard to the conclusions of the evaluating competent authority.\n(5) According to that opinion, biocidal products used for product-type 21 and containing tolylfluanid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.\n(6) Nevertheless, the acceptability of the risks related to the use of antifouling products, as well as the suitability of the proposed risk mitigation measures, need to be further confirmed. In order to facilitate, at the time of the renewal of the approvals of existing antifouling active substances, the review and comparison of the risks and benefits of these substances as well as of the risk mitigation measures applied, the expiry date of approval of these substances should be the same.\n(7) It is therefore appropriate to approve tolylfluanid for use in biocidal products for product-type 21 subject to compliance with certain specifications and conditions.\n(8) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials in accordance with Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.\n(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,", "main_body": ["Tolylfluanid shall be approved as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 21, subject to the specifications and conditions set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0167, 27.6.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1062/2014 of 4 August 2014 on the work programme for the systematic examination of all existing active substances contained in biocidal products referred to in Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L\u00a0294, 10.10.2014, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a03).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (OJ L\u00a0123, 24.4.1998, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nCommon Name IUPAC Name Minimum degree of purity of the active substance\u00a0(1) Date of approval Expiry date of approval Product type Specific conditions\u00a0(2)\nTolylfluanid IUPAC Name: 960 g/kg 1 July 2016 31 December 2025 21 The product assessment shall pay particular attention to the exposures, the risks and the efficacy linked to any uses covered by an application for authorisation, but not addressed in the Union level risk assessment of the active substance.\n(1) Products containing tolylfluanid shall not be authorised or used to control the growth and settlement of fouling organisms on freshwater going vessels.\n(2) For industrial or professional users, safe operational procedures and appropriate organisational measures shall be established.
