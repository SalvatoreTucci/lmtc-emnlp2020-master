During the term of validity of advance fixing of the agricultural conversion rate, and in order to qualify for the rate fixed in advance, certificates must be used in the Member State specified by the applicant at the time the application for advance fixing of the agricultural conversion rate was submitted.\nWhere certificates are used in a Member State other than that specified on the certificate by the applicant, the agricultural conversion rate to be applied shall be:\n- the lowest rate applied in the Member State of utilisation of the certificate from the date of advance fixing until the date of utilisation of the certificate, less 5 %, where an amount to be granted to the operator is concerned,\n- the highest rate applied in the Member State of utilisation of the certificate from the date of advance fixing until the date of utilisation of the certificate, plus 5 %, where an amount to be paid by the operator is concerned.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 1999.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1998.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) See page 1 of this Official Journal.\n(2) OJ L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 22, 31. 1. 1995, p. 1."}
