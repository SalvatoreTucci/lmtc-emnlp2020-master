PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\n(1) In March 1999, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999(2), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.\n(2) Within the framework of this proceeding, the Commission, by Decision 1999/215/EC of 16 March 1999(3), accepted a price undertaking offered by, inter alia, the Hungarian company Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat Rt (\"the company\").\n(3) Imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Hungary exported to the Community by this company (TARIC Additional Code 8582 ) were exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Article 2(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999.\nB. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING\n(4) Following changes in its trading activities, the company advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking.\n(5) Accordingly, by Commission Decision 2002/890/EC(4), the undertaking by the company has been withdrawn and its name has been removed from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted, in Article 1(1) of Decision 1999/215/EC.\nC. DEFINITIVE DUTIES\n(6) The investigation which led to the undertaking offered by the company was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and injury by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999.\n(7) In accordance with Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, the rate of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed on exports manufactured by the company must be based on the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. In this regard, and in consideration of the fact that the dumping margin established was lower than the injury margin, it is considered appropriate to set the definitive anti-dumping duty rate at a level of 26,4 % ad valorem, corresponding to the dumping margin found (see also recital 26 of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999).\nD. AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 603/1999\n(8) In view of the above, Article 1(2) and Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999 listing the companies on which anti-dumping duties are imposed and those which are exempted from the anti-dumping duties should be amended,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 603/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
