Portugal has shown that the historical percentage has remained stable over time. Portugal should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resources base using a fixed percentage in accordance with the letter sent by the Commission.\n(3) Portugal has requested authorisation from the Commission to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from 2011 to calculate the weighted average rate of VAT for the financial year 2014. The latest available ESA 95 National Accounts data with the necessary level of disaggregation is from year 2010, whereas ESA 2010 National Accounts data with the necessary disaggregation will be available from year 2011 by the time Portugal has to submit its statement of the VAT own resources base for the financial year 2014. Portugal should therefore be authorised to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from year 2011 for the purpose of calculating the weighted average rate of VAT for financial year 2014.\n(4) Under Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) (ESA\u00a02010), Member States may, for the purpose of determination of the VAT-based own resource, use data based on the ESA 2010 while Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom\u00a0(5) remains in force, where the required detailed ESA 95 data are not available.\n(5) For reasons of transparency and legal certainty it is appropriate to limit the applicability of the authorisation in time.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Commission Implementing Decision 2013/749/EU, Euratom\u00a0(6) accordingly,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2013/749/EU, Euratom is amended as follows:\n(1) the title is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\nTransport of passengers (point (10)).\u2019\n(3) the following Article 1a is inserted:\n(4) Article 2 is replaced by the following:", "This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 November 2014.\nFor the Commission\nKristalina GEORGIEVA\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0155, 7.6.1989, p.\u00a09.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (OJ L\u00a0347, 11.12.2006, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Ares(2014)405079.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (OJ L\u00a0174, 26.6.2013, p.\u00a01).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities' own resources (OJ L\u00a0163, 23.6.2007, p.\u00a017).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2013/749/EU, Euratom of 10 December 2013 authorising Portugal to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base (OJ L\u00a0333, 12.12.2013, p.\u00a081)."}
