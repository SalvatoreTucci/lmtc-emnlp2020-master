Pursuant to Article 2 of that Regulation the detailed rules of application should be laid down in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.\n(2) For the allocation of the tariff quota and given the products concerned it is appropriate to apply the method of simultaneous examination referred to in the second indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.\n(3) To be eligible for the benefit of these tariff quotas, live animals should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(3) (hereinafter called the Agreement).\n(4) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in trade of a significant scale with third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the year 2003 given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience has shown that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable. Operators in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus and Malta (hereinafter the new Member States) should be allowed to apply on the basis of imports from countries which for them were third countries during the year 2003.\n(5) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n(6) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2004 should be denied access to the quota, a security should be fixed for import rights, licences should not be transferable and import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(7) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application should respect a maximum and a minimum number of heads.\n(8) It should be stipulated that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied.\n(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(4) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(5).\n(10) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that, with regard to the import rights security, such application constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(6).\n(11) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(12) With a view of ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Community tariff quota is hereby opened on an autonomous and transitional basis for the period from the date of the entry into force of this Regulation to 30 June 2005 for the import of 4\u00a0600 heads of any live bovine animal originating in Switzerland weighing more than 160\u00a0kg, falling within CN code 0102\u00a090\u00a041, 0102\u00a090\u00a049, 0102\u00a090\u00a051, 0102\u00a090\u00a059, 0102\u00a090\u00a061, 0102\u00a090\u00a069, 0102\u00a090\u00a071 or 0102\u00a090\u00a079.\nThis tariff quota shall have the order number 09.4203.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the products referred to in the first paragraph shall be those provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible under the quota provided for in Article 1, applicants must be natural or legal persons and must prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, at the time they submit their applications, that they have imported at least 50 animals covered by CN codes 0102\u00a010 and 0102\u00a090 during the year 2003.
