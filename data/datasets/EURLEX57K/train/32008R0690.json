Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, \u2018protected zones\u2019 exposed to particular plant health risks may be defined and therefore may be accorded special protection under conditions compatible with the internal market. Such zones were defined in Commission Directive 2001/32/EC.\n(3) Certain Member States or certain areas in Member States are recognised as protected zones in respect of certain harmful organisms. In some cases recognition was granted provisionally, because the full information necessary to show that the harmful organism in question was not present in the Member State or area concerned had not been provided or efforts to eradicate such an organism had not been concluded. Where the Member States concerned have provided the necessary information, the zones in question should be recognised as permanent protected zones. The provisional recognition should exceptionally be extended for a further limited period to give the Member States concerned the necessary additional time to submit information showing that that organism is not present or, where necessary, to complete their efforts to eradicate it. In other cases protected zones should no longer be recognised as such since harmful organisms are now present.\n(4) Cyprus was provisionally recognised as a protected zone with respect to Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch), Ips sexdentatus B\u00f6rner and Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say until 31 March 2008. From information supplied by Cyprus since the provisional recognition was granted, it appears that those organisms are not present in Cyprus. Therefore Cyprus should be recognised as a permanent protected zone with respect to those organisms.\n(5) Certain regions of Spain were recognised as protected zones with respect to Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Den. and Schiff.). From information supplied by Spain, it appears that that organism is now established in these regions. They should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that organism.\n(6) Certain regions in Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Slovakia, and the whole territory of Ireland and Lithuania were provisionally recognised as protected zones with respect to Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. until 31 March 2008.\n(7) From information supplied by Ireland, Lithuania and Slovakia, it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zones for those countries in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should exceptionally be extended for two years to give those Member States the necessary time to submit information showing that that organism is not present or, where necessary, to complete their efforts to eradicate it.\n(8) From information supplied by Italy and Slovenia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in some regions, which have previously been provisionally recognised as protected zones for that organism until 31 March 2008. Those regions should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone for that organism.\n(9) From information supplied by Austria, it appears that due to unfavourable conditions in 2007 there were several outbreaks of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. in some parts of its territory, which have been provisionally recognised as protected zones for this harmful organism. For this reason, the provisional recognition of the protected zones for certain regions in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should be extended for one year to give Austria the necessary time to verify that the eradication efforts made by Austria in 2007 are efficient and submit information showing that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is not present or, where necessary, to complete its efforts to eradicate that organism in 2008.\n(10) Malta was provisionally recognised as a protected zone with respect to Citrus tristeza virus (European strains) until 31 March 2008. From information supplied by Malta, it appears that the efforts to eradicate that organism have been successful. Therefore Malta should be recognised as a permanent protected zone with respect to that organism.\n(11) The territory of Portugal was recognised as a protected zone with respect to Citrus tristeza virus (European strains). From information supplied by Portugal, it appears that that organism is now established in a part of its territory. That part of the Portuguese territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that organism.\n(12) It is therefore necessary to modify the existing designation of protected zones.\n(13) In the past protected zones were recognised and amended by Directive. To achieve a timely and simultaneous application by Member States, protected zones should be recognised by Regulation.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health.\n(15) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,", "main_body": ["The zones in the Community listed in Annex I are recognised as protected zones within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 2(1)(h) of Directive 2000/29/EC, in respect of the harmful organism(s) listed against their names in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Directive 2001/32/EC, as amended by the acts listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.
