Accordingly, the approved plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the emergency vaccination of those pigs against that disease should no longer apply in those areas.\n(3) Slovakia has also informed the Commission about the recent evolution of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the presence of that disease in the districts of Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky. In the light of the epidemiological information available, the measures of the plan for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs need to be extended to include part of the districts of Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, Kom\u00e1rno and Levice.\n(4) For the sake of transparency of Community legislation, the areas covered by those plans as set out in the Annex to Decision 2005/59/EC should be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.\n(5) Decision 2005/59/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2005/59/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Slovak Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 316, 1.12.2001, p. 5.
