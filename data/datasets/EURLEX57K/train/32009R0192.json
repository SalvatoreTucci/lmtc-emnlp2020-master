It is a necessary step towards providing data conforming to the exchange standards specified by the Commission (Eurostat).\nData is sent as a set of records (data set).\nConfidential data has to be sent with the true value being recorded in the value field and a flag indicating that the data is confidential in accordance with Article 2(2).\nMonetary data has to be expressed in thousands of national currency units (euro for the countries of the euro area). Countries acceding to the euro area shall report monetary data in euro instead of national currency as from the year of their accession.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data set identifier\nAll data sets that the Commission (Eurostat) and the national authorities transmit shall be identified by applying the naming convention specified in the detailed documentation and guidelines regarding the exchange standards that the Commission (Eurostat) makes available.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data sets, structure and definition of fields\nThis section gives the contents of the data sets that the Commission (Eurostat) and the national authorities shall transmit. The data set technical names, structure, fields, codes and attributes to be used shall be included in the most recent version of the Eurostat Business Registers Recommendations Manual referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 177/2008.\nThe data processing of the EuroGroups register is a cyclical process, which the Commission (Eurostat) starts centrally. At the end of each cycle a population frame shall be available for compilers of statistics in Member States.\nAt the beginning of each cycle the Commission (Eurostat) transmits data sets with metadata, e.g. NACE classification, to the appropriate national statistical authorities (hereinafter referred to as NSAs) to ensure that in all countries the same metadata is available and used.\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First data exchange\nThe first data exchange takes place after the start of the processing of new data on legal units received from private providers of basic register data. If there is more than one provider, data referring to the same legal units is linked. The Commission (Eurostat) transmits to the NSAs the following data sets with information on the results of this linkage process and information on legal units. NSAs transmit back the same data sets with the corrected and completed information including confidentiality flags.\nData set with results of the linkage process\nContents Identity number (1.1)\nData sets with information on legal units\nContents Identity number (1.1)\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Integration of data sources from different Member States\nThe next step of the data processing is the integration of information coming from different Member States centrally at the Commission (Eurostat). This information refers to control and ownership of legal units and to the statistical unit enterprise, which is defined by the Member States and may consist of one or several legal units. The Commission (Eurostat) shall transmit the results of this integration to the NSAs, which transmit back the data sets with the corrected and completed information including confidentiality flags.\nData sets with information on control and ownership of units\nContents Identity numbers of resident legal units, which are controlled by the legal unit (1.11a)\nData sets with information on enterprises\nContents Identity number (3.1)\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compilation of truncated and global enterprise groups\nThe next stage is the compilation of the truncated enterprise groups and the global enterprise groups. The Commission (Eurostat) shall transmit the results of this compilation to the NSAs, which transmit back the data sets with the corrected and completed information including confidentiality flags.\nAt the end of the cycle the Commission (Eurostat) shall transmit the results of the final compilation of the truncated and global enterprise groups to the NSAs. The Commission (Eurostat) shall transmit data to NSAs other than those of the reporting country only for the characteristics listed in Part B of this Annex.\nData sets with information on global enterprise groups\nContents Identity number of the global group (4.11)\nData sets with information on truncated enterprise groups\nContents Identity number of the truncated group (4.1)\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHARACTERISTICS TO BE TRANSMITTED ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 2(3)\nThe Commission (Eurostat) shall, exclusively for statistical purposes, transmit to the appropriate national authorities of Member States other than the reporting country, the following characteristics, including confidentiality flags, concerning multinational enterprise groups and their constituent units when at least one unit of the group is located in the territory of that Member State.\nLEGAL UNIT\nIDENTIFICATION CHARACTERISTICS 1.1.
