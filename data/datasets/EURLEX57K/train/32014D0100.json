As a result, it may spread from one Member State to another Member State and to third countries through trade in live pigs or their products.\n(3) Council Directive 2002/60/EC\u00a0(3) lays down minimum measures to be applied within the Union for the control of African swine fever. Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC provides for the establishment of an infected area following the confirmation of one or more cases of African swine fever in feral pigs.\n(4) Poland has informed the Commission of the current African swine fever situation on its territory, and in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC, it has established an infected area where the measures referred to in Articles 15 and 16 of that Directive are applied.\n(5) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, it is necessary to establish in collaboration with the Member State concerned a Union list of the infected territories for African swine fever in Poland.\n(6) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, the infected territories in Poland should be listed in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation established in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC.\n(7) This Decision is to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Poland shall ensure that the infected area established in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC comprise at least the territories listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply until 14 March 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever (OJ L 192, 20.7.2002, p. 27).\nANNEX\nINFECTED AREA\nThe following territories in the republic of Poland:\n\u2014 in voivodship podlaskie: the poviat sejne\u0144ski; in poviat augustowski, the municipalities of P\u0142aska, Lipsk and Sztabin; the poviat sok\u00f3lski; in poviat bia\u0142ostocki, the municipalities Czarna Bia\u0142ostocka, Supra\u015bl, Zabud\u00f3w, Micha\u0142owo and Gr\u00f3dek; and the poviats hajnowski, bielski and siemiatycki;\n\u2014 in voivodship mazowieckie: the poviat \u0142osicki;\n\u2014 in voivodship lubelskie: the poviats bialski and w\u0142odawski."}
