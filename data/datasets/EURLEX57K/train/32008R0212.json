If, however, the contract work is not performed entirely by specialised units (e.g. if holders hire machines but employ their own workers), this activity must be recorded in Division 77 of NACE Rev. 2 (Rental and leasing activities); in this case, amounts paid by the holders to enterprises working under contract must be recorded as \u2018other goods and services\u2019 under \u2018intermediate consumption\u2019 (cf. 2.108).\u2019\n(4) Paragraph 1.55 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.55. The EAA are an integral part of the European system of accounts and therefore for their compilation use is made of Eurostat\u2019s general classification of economic activities, NACE Rev. 2. NACE Rev. 2 is a four-level nomenclature of activities which was compiled in 2006. It is in fact a revision of the general industrial classification of economic activities within the European Communities, or NACE, which was first published by Eurostat in 1970.\u2019\n(5) Paragraph 1.57 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.57. NACE Rev. 2 is a classification of activities which is used for defining industries in the national accounts. It is based on the four-level coding system described below:\n\u2014 a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections);\n\u2014 a second level consisting of headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions);\n\u2014 a third level consisting of headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups); and\n\u2014 a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes).\u2019\n(6) Paragraph 1.62 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.62. For national accounts purposes the agricultural industry is defined as all units performing, either solely or together with other secondary economic activities, activities which come under Division 01 of NACE Rev. 2 \u201cCrop and animal production, hunting and related service activities\u201d. Division 01 comprises\u00a0(1):\n\u2014 Group 01,1: Growing of non-perennial crops;\n\u2014 Group 01,2: Growing of perennial crops;\n\u2014 Group 01,3: Plant propagation;\n\u2014 Group 01,4: Animal production;\n\u2014 Group 01,5: Mixed farming;\n\u2014 Group 01,6: Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities;\n\u2014 Group 01,7: Hunting, trapping and related service activities.\n(7) Paragraph 1.63 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.63. The list of characteristic agricultural activities of the EAA corresponds to these seven groups of activities (01,1to 01,7), but with the following differences:\n\u2014 inclusion of the production of wine and olive oil (exclusively using grapes and olives grown by the same holding)\u00a0(2),\n\u2014 exclusion of the activities relating to the production of seeds upstream and downstream of multiplication and certain activities which, in NACE Rev. 2, are considered as agricultural services (e.g. the operation of irrigation systems \u2014 only agricultural contract work is taken into account here).\n(8) Paragraph 1.64 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.64. All units which perform characteristic activities of the agricultural industry of the EAA must be included. The units in question perform the activities included in the following groups in NACE Rev. 2:\n\u2014 groups 01,1 and 01,2: Growing of non-perennial and perennial crops,\n\u2014 production of seeds: only the units engaged in seed multiplication,\n\u2014 group 01,3: Plant propagation\n\u2014 group 01,4: Animal production,\n\u2014 group 01,5: Mixed farming,\n\u2014 group 01,6: Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities\n\u2014 excluding units which perform agricultural service activities other than contract work (i.e. units which operate irrigation systems or seed processing for propagation),\n\u2014 group 01,7: Hunting, trapping and related service activities.\u2019\n(9) Paragraph 1.65 is deleted.\n(10) The title in point (a) above paragraph 1.67 is replaced by the following:\n(11) Paragraph 1.67 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.67. Groups from 01,1 to 01,3 include a systematic breakdown making it possible to classify all crop production activities in the EU Member States.\u2019\n(12) Paragraph 1.69 is deleted.\n(13) Paragraph 1.71 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.71. Following the convention adopted by NACE Rev. 2\u00a0(3), when own produced agricultural products are processed by the same unit of production, the processed products are also attributed to agriculture. As an example, grape must, wine and olive oil are treated as food products in the CPA. NACE Rev. 2 classifies the production of wine and olive oil under section C \u201cmanufacturing\u201d (Classes 11,02 \u201cManufacture of wine from grape\u201d and 10,41 \u201cManufacture of oils and fats\u201d). Only the production of wine grapes and olives comes under agriculture (Classes 01,21 \u201cGrowing of grapes\u201d and 01,26 \u201cGrowing of oleaginous fruits\u201d). However, following the above convention, wine and olive oil produced from grapes and olives grown by the same unit of production are attributed to agriculture.\n(14) The title in point (b) above paragraph 1.76 is replaced by the following:\n(15) Paragraph 1.77 is deleted.\n(16) In paragraph 1.78, the second sentence is replaced by the following:\n(17) The title in point (c) above paragraph 1.80 is replaced by the following:\n(18) Paragraph 1.80 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.80. The activities in group 01,6 can be divided into two categories:\n\u2014 agricultural services in the form of contract work at the production stage (i.e. agricultural contract work),\n\u2014 \u201cother\u201d agricultural services (the operation of irrigation systems, seed processing for propagation, etc.).\u2019\n(19) Paragraph 1.81 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.81. Agricultural service activities in the second category are not treated as characteristic EAA activities (even though they are recorded in the agricultural accounts of the national accounts), since they are not traditional or typical agricultural activities.\u2019\n(20) In paragraph 1.86, the second sentence is replaced by the following:\n(21) Paragraph 1.89 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.89. Animal husbandry performed on farms for remuneration (the provision of land for livestock) is agricultural contract work since it is part of the agricultural production process. This heading does not, however, include the private rearing and care of saddle horses, since these activities do not constitute the production of goods but a genuine service within the meaning of the ESA 95 (section R of NACE Rev. 2).\u2019\n(22) The title in point (d) above paragraph 1.92 is replaced by the following:\n(23) Paragraph 1.92 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.92. This group of activities comprises the following activities: (i) hunting and trapping on a commercial basis; (ii) taking of animals (dead or alive) for food, fur or skin, or for use in research, in zoos or as pets; (iii) production of fur skins or reptile or bird skins from hunting or trapping activities. It should be noted that the production of hide and leather from slaughterhouses and hunting performed as a sports or recreation activity are not included as characteristic activities of the agricultural industry. Additionally, the \u201chunting\u201d group does not comprise the breeding of game on holdings, which should be recorded under class 01,49 \u201cRaising of other animals\u201d.\u2019\n(24) In paragraph 1.93, the equation for \u2018EAA agricultural industry\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n= NA agricultural branch\n\u2013 Units engaged in seed production (for research or certification)\n\u2013 Production of units providing associated agricultural services other than agricultural contract work (e.g. the operation of irrigation systems)\n\u2013 Units for which the agricultural activity represents solely a leisure activity\n+ Agricultural activities of units whose principal activity is not agricultural (cf. 1,18)\u2019\n(25) The first subparagraph of paragraph 2.055 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181. The two activities exercised should come under different four-digit levels of NACE Rev. 2 (Division 01: Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities). The application of this criterion thus precludes, for example, the valuation of seed produced and used on the same holding for crop production (during the same accounting period);\u2019\n(26) In paragraph 2.062, the first sentence is replaced by the following:\n(27) Paragraph 2.063 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.063. The imputed rental value of the owner-occupied housing unit is not recorded here but in the branch \u201cRenting and operating of own or leased real estate\u201d (Class 68,20 of NACE Rev. 2). Renting of accommodation is a non-agricultural activity which is always considered to be separable from agricultural activity.\u2019\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0See also the \u201cExplanatory notes\u201d: Eurostat: NACE Rev. 2, Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community, Theme 2, Series E, Luxembourg, 2007.\u2019\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The inclusion of these activities in fact does not represent a deviation from NACE Rev. 2: see the \u201cIntroductory guidelines\u201d to NACE Rev. 2.\u2019\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0See the \u201cIntroductory guidelines\u201d to NACE Rev. 2: Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community, Theme 2, Series E, Luxembourg, 2007.\u2019"}
