The epidemiological investigations undertaken in 2009 suggested that a newly described strain of ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1), namely OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar, played a major role in the increased mortality.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 175/2010 of 2 March 2010 implementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards measures to control increased mortality in oysters of the species Crassostrea gigas in connection with the detection of Ostreid herpesvirus 1 \u03bc\u03bdar (OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar)\u00a0(4) was adopted with the aim of preventing the further spread of OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar.

In the interests of clarity and simplification of Union legislation, the respective placing on the market requirements should be laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008.\n(5) In order to prevent the introduction of OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar into Member States or parts thereof listed in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU, consignments of Pacific oysters intended for farming or relaying areas, and for dispatch centres, purification centres or similar businesses before human consumption, introduced into such Member States or parts thereof, should originate from an area with an equivalent health status.\n(6) To ensure that those requirements are complied with, such consignments should be accompanied by an animal health certificate providing the necessary attestations.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for transitional measures to allow Member States and the industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(9) To avoid the further spread of OsHV-1 \u03bc\u03bdar, this Regulation should apply immediately following the date of expiry of Regulation (EU) No 175/2010.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, point (b)(ii) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(ii) aquaculture animals intended for farming, relaying areas, put and take fisheries, open ornamental facilities and restocking, and for dispatch centres, purification centres and similar businesses before human consumption in Member States and parts thereof with national measures approved by Commission Decision 2010/221/EU\u00a0(6);\n(2) in Article 8a(1)(a), the following point (iii) is added:\n\u2018(iii) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU as subject to a surveillance programme for one or more of the diseases listed in the first column of that table;\u2019;\n(3) the following Article 8b is inserted:\n(a) are introduced into Member States or parts thereof listed in the second and fourth column of the table set out in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU as subject to a surveillance programme for one or more of the diseases listed in the first column of that table;\n(b) are of species which are listed in Part C of Annex II as species susceptible to the disease(s), for which a surveillance programme applies in accordance with Decision 2010/221/EU, as referred to in point (a).\n(a) inactivates enveloped viruses;
