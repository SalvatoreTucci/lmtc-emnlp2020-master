It provides also for changes to existing tariff quotas for those products which are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 747/2001, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2276/2003 of 22 December 2003 opening tariff quotas and laying down the duties applicable within these tariff quotas for imports into the European Community of certain processed agricultural products originating in Egypt\u00a0(3), Commission Regulation (EC) No 955/2005 of 23 June 2005 opening a Community import quota for rice originating in Egypt\u00a0(4), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1002/2007 of 29 August 2007 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 concerning imports into the Community of rice originating in and coming from Egypt\u00a0(5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1455/2007 of 10 December 2007 opening certain Community import quotas for rice originating in Egypt\u00a0(6).\n(3) It is necessary to implement the new tariff quotas and the changes to the existing tariff quotas provided for in the Agreement. For reasons of clarity, it is appropriate to bring together all tariff quotas for agricultural and processed agricultural products originating in Egypt in one single legislative act.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly and Regulations (EC) No 2276/2003, (EC) No 955/2005, (EC) No 1002/2007 and (EC) No 1455/2007 should therefore be repealed.\n(5) Import licences issued under Regulation (EC) No 955/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1002/2007 are valid from their date of issue until the end of the following month. Where the validity period of import licences issued under those Regulations before the entry into force of this Regulation expires after the date of repeal of those Regulations, importers could not comply with their obligations related to import licences. Member States should therefore be permitted in such cases to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(7), and to release the security lodged by importers. In the interest of clarity it should also be provided that import licences issued after the entry into force of this Regulation under Regulation (EC) No 955/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1002/2007 are to be valid only until the date of repeal of those Regulations.\n(6) For the purpose of calculating the tariff quotas for the first year of application, it should be provided, in accordance with the Agreement, that the volumes of the tariff quotas for which the quota period starts before the date of entry into force of the Agreement, should be reduced by a proportion relating to that part of the period which has elapsed before that date.\n(7) Since the Agreement enters into force on 1 June 2010, this Regulation should apply from that date. However, in the interest of legal certainty, provisions concerning the validity of licences issued before that date should apply immediately.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Regulations (EC) No 2276/2003, (EC) No 955/2005, (EC) No 1002/2007 and (EC) No 1455/2007 are repealed.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The validity of import licences issued with an expiry date after 31 May 2010 under Regulation (EC) No 955/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1002/2007 before the entry into force of this Regulation shall expire on 31 May 2010.\nBy derogation from Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 376/2008, until 30 June 2010 the titular holder of the import licences referred to in the first subparagraph may return the unused import licences to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned which shall release the security for the quantities not used.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By derogation from Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 955/2005 and Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1002/2007, the validity period of import licences issued under those Regulations after the entry into force of this Regulation shall not extend after 31 May 2010.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 June 2010 with the exception of Article 3 which shall apply from the date of the entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0109, 19.4.2001, p.\u00a02.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0106, 28.4.2010, p.\u00a039.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0336, 23.12.2003, p.\u00a046.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0164, 24.6.2005, p.\u00a05.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0226, 30.8.2007, p.\u00a015.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0325, 11.12.2007, p.\u00a074.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0114, 26.4.2008, p.\u00a03.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX IV\nEGYPT\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording for the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by the coverage of the CN codes as they exist at the time of adoption of this Regulation.
