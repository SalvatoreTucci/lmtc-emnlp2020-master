The granting of compensation may not last longer than six months. It may be extended by a further six months provided a conversion plan approved by the Commission is implemented for the fleet concerned.\n(5) On 18 July 2005 the Commission adopted a Decision approving the conversion plan for fishing vessels affected by the non-renewal of the fishing protocol between the European Community and the Republic of Angola within the framework of the FIFG operational programme relating to Community structural interventions in the fisheries sector for Objective I regions in Spain during the 2000 to 2006 period.\n(6) In order to facilitate the implementation of that conversion plan, Community fishing vessels covered by the plan which, as a result of this denunciation, cease their activities under the Agreement should be exempted from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999. In particular, they should not be subject to the obligation to reimburse public aid for the temporary cessation of activities or for renewal, modernisation or equipment or to the obligation to demonstrate continuous activity in the year preceding their deletion from the Community\u2019s fishing vessel register,", "main_body": ["The Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Angola on fishing off Angola signed in Luanda on 1 February 1989 is hereby denounced on behalf of the Community.", "The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to notify the Government of the Republic of Angola of the denunciation of the Agreement.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Community fishing vessels listed in the conversion plan approved by the Commission Decision of 18 July 2005 shall not be subject to Article 10(3)(b)(ii) or (4) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 or to point 1.1(a) of Annex III thereto.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The capacity of each vessel benefiting from the derogation under Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 shall be considered as an exit supported by public aid subject to the provisions of Article 11(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy\u00a0(5).", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 July 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
