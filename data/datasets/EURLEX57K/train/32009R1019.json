These practices ensure that the essential characteristics of the name are maintained.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified.

The curd stays in moulds for 24 to 36 hours before being removed and salt added. The maturing process lasts for at least 10 days.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nThis Touraine goat\u2019s cheese has been distinct from those in neighbouring regions since the 18th century, having adopted an original shape, which, according to tradition, is modelled on that of the Pouligny church tower. It very quickly became renowned for its authenticity, something which was confirmed when it was awarded a prize in the 1901 Paris competition. At a very early stage, the producers' group took steps to maintain the specific nature of the cheese, and in 1976 achieved recognition in the form of designation of origin status being granted.\nThe area in question enjoys reliable conditions with regard to climate (warmer and drier weather than in surrounding areas), geology (low quality soil with a high clay and sand content) and flora which encourages the rearing of goats and has therefore resulted in the traditional production of this cheese.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName: Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress: 51 rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris, FRANCE\nTel. + 33 153898000\nFax + 33 153898060\nE-mail: info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut National des Appellations d\u2019Origine is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the French Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName: Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)\nAddress: 59, boulevard Vincent Auriol, 75703 Paris C\u00e9dex 13, FRANCE\nTel. +33 144871717\nFax +33 144973037\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nThe labelling for the cheese must contain the name of the designation of origin (Pouligny-Saint-Pierre) in characters at least two-thirds the size of the largest characters on the label."}
