TABLES OF OBJECTIVES\n(Refer to the end of the Annex)\nII. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n1. Segmentation\nSegmentation of the fleet shall take account of the different resources fished and fishing zones (coastal, Community and international/third country, Mediterranean and waters of the remotest Community regions), the groups of species targeted (demersal, benthic and pelagic) and the gear used.\nThe segments thus determined shall be homogeneous and distinct, i.e. the objectives fixed for each segment must be attained by the end of the programme.Indication of segments:\nFor each segment of the fleet a corresponding list of vessels and their characteristics are transmitted to the Commission by the Member State before 31 December 1994, in accordance with the procedures described in the framework of Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/94 concerning the fishing vessel register of the Community (1), and in particular Annex I thereof, and the categories of programmes defined therein.\nGrouping of segments:\nSubject to the agreement of the Commission, the Member State can group several segments of the fleet. In this case, the rate of reduction applied is that corresponding to the most sensitive of the stocks targeted by the group which applies to the new segment thus formed.\nManagement of segments with polyvalent vessels:\nFor clearly defined fisheries, the Member State can subsegment the fleet composed of polyvalent vessels targeting alternatively demersal, benthic or pelagic stocks. Each subsegment is distinguished by the sum of the fishing effort devoted to it, and registered as such in the table of objectives shown in the Annex to the present Decision. The management of the corresponding fishing effort must be in accordance with the procedures of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 109/94.\n2. Final objectives for each segment\nThe final objectives shall be fixed in terms of capacity (tonnage in GT and engine power in kW) on the basis of the situation on 1 January 1995.\nThe following formula shall be used to determine the objective for each segment:\nLet (a) be a segment for which the capacity in tonnage and engine power at 1 January 1995 is known and to which a reduction coefficient (y) is applied.\nSegment objective (a) = (1-y) \u00d7 situation at 1 January 1995.\nThe application of the preceding formula to determine the final objective in gross tonnage (GT) by segment takes into account, segment by segment, the estimation of gross tonnage as at 1 January 1995 for each of these segments on the basis of the provisions of Commission Decision No 95/84/EC (2).\nThe gross tonnage GT of the fleet at 1 January 1995 is the sum of the GT tonnages by segment thus obtained.\nThe estimation of GT at 1 January 1995 of vessels which have since been permanently withdrawn from the national and Community fishing vessel registers and for which the remeasurement formulae defined by Decision 95/84/EC cannot be applied, will be made by applying the ratio GT/GRT of existing vessels in the same length class and belonging to the same segment.\n3. Calculations of reductions in activity\nBy the end of the programme, for the Member States applying this provision, activity must be reduced to a predetermined level not exceeding the authorized limits, so that the sum of the annual intermediate reductions in activity is at least equal to that which would result from a linear reduction in activity year by year.\nThe reductions in fishing effort thus achieved will be calculated at the end of the programme so that the objectives can be readjusted by a percentage equal to that due to the effect of the reductions in activity on overall fishing effort.\nNon-application of these measures may not result in an authorization to increase activity.\n4. Annual intermediate objectives\nNot applicable.\n5. Implementation and monitoring\nImplementation of the measures to reduce the activity of vessels in certain segments of the fleet will require that the Member State provide the Commission with the assurance that it will have the following information for each of the segments concerned:\n- the data on the level of activity prior to the entry into force of the measures (reference basis: 1994),\n- assurance that it has effective time at sea management tools and is able to manage licensing schemes, particularly with regard to multi purpose vessels,\n- data permitting the measures implemented under this programme to be monitored, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 109/94 concerning the fishing vessel register of the Community, and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof.\n6. Revision of the programme\nThe programme may be revised, on the initiative of the Commission, in the light of the experience gained and the national and Community rules in force, in order to take account of new factors which might help improve the implementation of the programme and ensure that its objectives are better met.\n>TABLE>\n(1) OJ No L 19, 22. 1. 1994, p. 5.\n(2) OJ No L 67, 25. 3. 1995, p. 33."}
