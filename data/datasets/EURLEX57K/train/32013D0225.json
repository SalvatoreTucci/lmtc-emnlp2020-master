It provides that three controls be carried out in selected apiaries and that the last control be carried out during the honey production season in order to objectively estimate the number of lost or weakened colonies. The period should be selected by the Member State depending on its specific climatic characteristics.\n(3) Certain Member States have requested that the period of the surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses, provided for in Implementing Decision 2012/362/EU, be extended after 30 June 2013, as taking account of the geographical location of those Member States and seasonal conditions, it could be impossible to complete their programmes before that date.\n(4) In order to make it possible for all Member States taking part in the surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses to conclude the third round of visits in summer, it is necessary to amend the end date provided for in Implementing Decision 2012/362/EU from 30 June 2013 to 30 September 2013.\n(5) Implementing Decision 2012/362/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1(2)(a) of Implementing Decision 2012/362/EU, \u201830 June 2013\u2019 is replaced by \u201830 September 2013\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, Hungary, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0155, 18.6.2009, p.\u00a030.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0176, 6.7.2012, p.\u00a065.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/liveanimals/bees/docs/annex_i_pilot_project_en.pdf"}
