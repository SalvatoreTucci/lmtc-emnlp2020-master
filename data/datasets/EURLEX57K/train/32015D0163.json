A number of the designated events are generally considered as events of major importance for society such as the summer and winter Olympic Games, the final and semi-finals of the Football World Cup and the European Football Championship. The list also includes other football matches within those events involving the Polish national team, including qualifying games. As demonstrated by the Polish authorities, these events commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. In addition they have a special general resonance in Poland, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events. Moreover, some matches within the Football World Cup and the European Football Championship including qualifying games, involve the Polish national team.\n(7) These other football matches in official tournaments and the Champions League and UEFA Cup where the Polish national team or Polish club participate, command large television audiences and traditionally have been broadcast on free-to-air television and have special general resonance in Poland.\n(8) The matches of world and European men's and women's volleyball championships where the Polish national team participates, including the qualifying tournaments and the men's volleyball World League, commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. Additionally, they generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve a national team in an international tournament of major importance. This interest is reinforced by the fact that Polish participants have earned significant achievements in these tournaments.\n(9) The semi-finals and finals of world and European men's handball championships, apart from commanding large television audiences and being traditionally broadcast on free-to air television, generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. Other competitions during semi-finals and finals of world and European men's handball championships where the Polish national team was involved also commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to air television. In addition, they generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve a national team in an international tournament of major importance where Polish participants have earned significant achievements.\n(10) The Nordic Ski World Championships, Ski Jumping World Cup events and women's Cross-Country Ski World Cup events, apart from commanding large television audiences and being traditionally broadcast on free-to-air television, generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve the Polish national team in an international tournament of major importance where the Polish participants have earned significant achievements.\n(11) The World Championship in Athletics commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. Moreover, they have special and wide-spread resonance in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow the disciplines represented at this event. Polish competitors have earned significant achievements in pole vault, shot-put and discus throw.\n(12) Taking into account the modalities according to which those events of major importance for society will be broadcast, the definition of a \u2018qualifying broadcaster\u2019, the role of the Broadcasting Council in the resolution of disputes mechanism in case of disputes in the course of the implementation of the measures, and the date foreseen for the entry into force of the final Polish measures (12 months after the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union), the designated measures do not go beyond what is necessary for the achievement of the aim pursued, namely the protection of the right to information and the wide access of the public to television coverage of national or non-national events of major importance for society. Therefore, it may be concluded that the effects on the right of property, as provided for in Article 17 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, do not go beyond those which are intrinsically linked to the inclusion of the events in the list provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU.\n(13) For the same reasons, the Polish measures appear to be proportionate to justify, by the overriding reason of public interest in ensuring wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society, the derogation from the fundamental freedom to provide services laid down in Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In addition, the Polish measures do not constitute any discrimination or market foreclosure against other Member States' broadcasters, right holders or other economic operators.\n(14) The designated measures are also compatible with Union competition rules in so far as the definition of the qualifying broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria, which allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of designated events is not disproportionate to an extent that would distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets. Therefore, it may be considered that the effects on the freedom of competition do not go beyond those which are intrinsically linked to the inclusion of the events in the list provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU.\n(15) The Commission communicated the measures to be taken by Poland to the other Member States and presented the results of its verification to the committee established pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 2010/13/EU. The committee adopted a favourable opinion,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures to be taken by Poland, pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU, and notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 14(2) of that Directive are compatible with Union law.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measures, as taken by Poland, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 November 2014.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnther OETTINGER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a095, 15.4.2010, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX\nPublication pursuant to Article 14 of Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive).\nThe measures taken by Poland, to be published in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 2010/13/EU, are set out in the following extract from the Broadcasting Act of 29 December 1992 (Journal of Laws No 43/2011, item 226, as amended) and the Regulation of the National Broadcasting Council of 17 November 2014 establishing a list of major events:\n\u2018Broadcasting Act of 29 December 1992\nArticle 20b 1.

The National Broadcasting Council may, as provided for in international agreements binding upon Poland, adopt a regulation establishing:\n(1) lists of events deemed by other European countries to be major events;\n(2) rules governing the exercise of exclusive television broadcasting rights for the events referred to in subparagraph 1 so as to ensure that the exercise of such rights by broadcasters subject to this Act does not deprive viewers in the country concerned of the possibility of receiving coverage of those events under rules laid down by that country in accordance with international law.\u2019\nJOURNAL OF LAWS\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND\nWarsaw, 3 December 2014\nItem 1705\nREGULATION\nOF THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING COUNCIL\nof 17 November 2014\nestablishing a list of major events\nThe following provisions are laid down pursuant to Article 20b(3) of the Broadcasting Act of 29 December 1992 (Journal of Laws No 43/2011, item 226, as amended\u00a0(1)):\nSection 1.
