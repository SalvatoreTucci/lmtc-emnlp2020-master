This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 2004/2005 marketing year.\n(2) In order to remedy this situation, it is appropriate to grant export refunds in respect of zones which may be supplied by the Community. The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the quantities of rice benefiting from refunds, and therefore to fix the amount of the export refund by tendering procedure.\n(3) It should be stated that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice\u00a0(2) applies to this tendering procedure.\n(4) For the sake of sound management of the markets, the tendering procedure should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92\u00a0(3).\n(5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture\u00a0(4), amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro.
