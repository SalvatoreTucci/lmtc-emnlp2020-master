(hereinafter referred to as: \u2018the harmful organism\u2019).\n(2) On the basis of recent scientific information on the possible damage caused by the harmful organism, it appears that the list of plants, wood and bark susceptible for the harmful organism should be extended and updated.\n(3) In order to avoid misinterpretation, it should be laid down clearly that plant passports are necessary for each movement of specific species of susceptible plants within the Community.\n(4) As a result of the official surveys carried out under Decision 2002/757/EC, it appears that at least two official inspections of specific species of susceptible plants in places of production are needed annually during the growing period to confirm the absence of the harmful organism. In order to allow sufficient time to adjust to this requirement, it should apply as of 1 May 2007.\n(5) From follow-up experience with the implementation of eradication measures on outbreak sites, it appears that measures should cover not only plants, but also associated growing media and plant debris. Those measures should also include phytosanitary measures on the growing surface around such sites.\n(6) It further appears necessary to continue the surveys carried out by the Member States as regards evidence of infestation by the harmful organism and to notify the results thereof on an annual basis.\n(7) It is appropriate that the results of such measures be reviewed after the next growing season, and possible subsequent measures be considered in the light of the results of that review. The subsequent measures should also take into account the information to be provided and the scientific opinions to be delivered by the Member States.\n(8) Decision 2002/757/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/757/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
