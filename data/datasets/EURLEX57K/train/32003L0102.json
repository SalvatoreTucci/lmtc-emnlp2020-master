Accordingly, this Directive should establish the fundamental provisions regarding pedestrian protection in the form of tests to be complied with by new types of vehicles and by new vehicles. The technical prescriptions for the application of such tests should be adopted by Commission decision.\n(9) The rapidly advancing technology in active safety means that collision mitigation and avoidance systems could provide major safety benefits, for example in reducing collision speed and adjusting impact direction. The development of such technologies should be encouraged by this Directive.\n(10) The associations representing the European, Japanese and Korean motor vehicle manufacturers have made commitments to start applying the EEVC recommendations concerning limit values and tests, or agreed alternative measures of at least equivalent effect, as from 2010, and a first set of limit values and tests as from 2005 to new types of vehicles and to apply the first set of tests to 80 % of all new vehicles as from 1 July 2010, to 90 % of all new vehicles as from 1 July 2011 and to all new vehicles as from 31 December 2012.\n(11) This Directive should also contribute to establishing a high level of protection in the context of the international harmonisation of legislation in this area, which started under the 1998 Agreement of the UN/ECE concerning the establishment of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles.\n(12) This Directive is one of the separate Directives which have to be complied with in order to conform to the EC type-approval procedure established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(3).\n(13) Directive 70/156/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["1.
