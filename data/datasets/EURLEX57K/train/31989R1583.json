It is also possible to assess the ash (1.2.4) and moisture (1.2.2) content and to obtain, by deduction, the other ingredients.\nIn order to correct the value of nitrogen of non-meat origin (Nx factor), it would be necessary to know the quantity of each ingredient containing nitrogen as well as the nitrogen content of these ingredients.\nThe following table shows the nitrogen content of several typical ingredients of non-meat origin containing nitrogen, which may be found in meat products:\n1.2 //  //  // Non-meat products  // % of nitrogen by weight  //    //   // Casein   // 15,8   // Sodium caseinate   // 14,8   // Soya isolate   // 14,5   // Textured soya   // 8,0  // Soya flour   // 8,0   // Monosodium glutamate (MSG)  // 8,3   //    //\nAs far as repeatability of analytical procedure is concerned, reference should be made to the relevant ISO standard.\nThe average result of at least two determinations must be taken into account."}
