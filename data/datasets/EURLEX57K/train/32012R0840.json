The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) as a feed additive for all avian species for fattening other than chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and ducks for fattening and all avian species for laying other than laying hens, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of preparations of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned), ducks for fattening, pigs for fattening and sows by Commission Regulations (EC) No 785/2007\u00a0(2) and (EC) No 379/2009\u00a0(3).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) for use as feed additive to all avian species for fattening other than chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and ducks for fattening and all avian species for laying other than laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 7 March 2012\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the phosphorus utilisation in all target species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 September 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 175, 5.7.2007, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 116, 9.5.2009, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(3):2619.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
