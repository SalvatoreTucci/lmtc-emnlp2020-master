GENERAL MEASURES\n1.1. STANDARDIZATION POLICY (1)\nAims\n(a) To contribute to the implementation of a Community standardization policy for information technology, in particular:\n- to identify priorities for information technology standadization through consultation of industry, users, the national standards organizations and the competent authorities in the Member States,\n- to establish the necessary work programmes with European standardization organizations and to determine the corresponding mandates for the preparation of standards;\n(b) to define and take action on priority sectors, in particular:\n- to harmonize the use of existing international information technology standards, or those about to be adopted, after the widest possible consultation,\n- to develop appropriate European standards (but only where there is no prospect of the adoption of appropriate international standards to meet an identified requirement),\n- to establish appropriate consultation and monitoring arrangements;\n(c) to promote research and cooperation with the object of coordinating the Community position with regard to international standards and, where necessary, to practices approved at Community level, in particular:\n- by providing the infrastructure required for effective cooperation between experts and in activities within the European Community;\n(d) to encourage the Member States to apply the standards approved at Community level, particularly in the public sector and in the Community institutions, and to encourage their general application through measures concerted between national centres competent in the matter, in particular:\n- by encouraging mutual recognition between Member States of the conformity of systems to information technology standards,\n- by organizing and providing the infrastructure required to ensure the availability of harmonized reference testing services for data-processing standards,\n- by working with European Community manufacturers' associations to ensure that products conforming to the standards are available in time to meet requirements;\n(e) to disseminate information in the Community in the field of standardization, in particular:\n- by linking potential users to existing and future data bases concerning data-processing standardization;\n(f) to make it easier for organizations in the Community to make a contribution to and to support international standardization.\n1.2. PUBLIC PROCUREMENT\nAims\n(a) To determine the most efficient methods for the rapid application in the public procurement sector of standards on which agreement has been reached;\n(b) to examine the effects, in the area of public procurement, of the full application of the relevant Community rules. In particular:\n- to compare the progress of European industry with reference to the measures taken by the Member States in the area of data processing procurement,\n- to collect the necessary statistical data,\n- to facilitate the establishment of equal conditions for the access of companies to public contracts in the Community within the framework of Council Directive 77/62/EEC of 21 December 1976 coordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts (1);\n(c) to coordinate national efforts concerning the general appraisal of systems and, in conjunction with national research centres in the field of data processing, to lay down principles for the establishment of appraisal criteria;\n(d) to study the possibility of laying down a number of principles to be applied in the evaluation of tenders;\n(e) to study the possibility of establishing common principles on the basis of which standard conditions of contract can be drawn up;\n(f) to organize exchanges of technical experience between national departments responsible for public procurement and to promote these exchanges by coordinating the work of national research centres in the field of data processing;\n(g) to identify topics likely to lead to the development of projects of common interest to public procurement agencies.\n1.3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECTOR, TRAINING, PROTECTION FOR DATA AND PERSONS\n1.3.1. Data, information and analysis\nAims\n(a) Continuation of the work on developments in the data-processing sector required under the Council resolution of 15 July 1974, taking account of the penetration of data processing into other areas of information technology;\n(b) communication of the results of analysis to industry, national administrations and other interested parties;\n(c) cooperation with other organizations working in similar fields so as to compare results and avoid duplication;\n(d) preparation and publication of an annual report on the situation and prospects of information technology in the Community, based on data and analysis resulting from the programme or derived from other sources;\n(e) report on the relationships between audio-visual technology data-processing and communications as they affect the market and society.\n1.3.2.
