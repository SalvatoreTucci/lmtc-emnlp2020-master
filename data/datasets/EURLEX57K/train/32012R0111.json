This causes a serious disturbance on the markets of those Member States. The Union olive oil market is characterised by a high level of interdependence and therefore the serious disturbance of the Spanish and Greek market risks to propagate to all the olive oil producing Member States.\n(3) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that aid for private storage may be granted for olive oil and that the aid should be fixed by the Commission in advance or by means of a tendering procedure.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 has established common rules for the implementation of the private storage aid scheme. Pursuant to Article 6 of that Regulation, a tendering procedure is to be opened in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in its Article 9.\n(5) The global quantity up to which private storage aid can be granted should be set at a level which, according to market analysis, would contribute to the stabilisation of the market.\n(6) In order to facilitate the administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts, the minimum quantity of product each tender must provide for should be fixed.\n(7) A security should be fixed in order to ensure that the operators fulfil their contractual obligations and that the measure will have its desired effect on the market.\n(8) In the light of the evolution of the market situation in the current marketing year and the forecasts for the following marketing year, the Commission should have the possibility to decide to shorten the term of contracts which are being performed and adjust the level of aid accordingly. That possibility has to be included in the contract, as provided for by Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, the time period of notification of all valid tenders by Member States to the Commission is to be fixed.\n(10) In order to prevent uncontrolled price falls, to react swiftly to the exceptional market situation and to ensure efficient management of this measure, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(11) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tendering procedure is hereby opened in order to determine the level of aid for private storage referred to in Article 31(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 for the categories of olive oil listed in the Annex to this Regulation and defined in point 1 of Annex XVI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The global quantity up to which aid for private storage can be granted shall be 100\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes.", "Applicable rules\nRegulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall apply save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "Submission of tenders\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sub-period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the first partial invitation to tender shall begin on 17 February 2012 and shall end on 21 February 2012 at 11:00 Brussels time.\nThe sub-period during which tenders may be submitted in response to the second partial invitation to tender shall begin on the first working day following the end of the preceding sub-period and shall end on 1 March 2012 at 11:00 Brussels time.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall relate to a storage period of 150 days.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each tender shall cover a minimum quantity of at least 50\u00a0tonnes.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an operator takes part in a tendering procedure for more than one category of oil or for vats located at different addresses, it shall submit a separate tender in each case.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders may be lodged only in Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia.", "Securities\nTenderers shall establish a security of EUR\u00a050 per tonne of olive oil covered by a tender.", "Shortening the term of contracts\nThe Commission may, on the basis of developments on the market in olive oil and the outlook for the future, decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, to shorten the term of contracts which are being performed and adjust the amount of the aid accordingly.
