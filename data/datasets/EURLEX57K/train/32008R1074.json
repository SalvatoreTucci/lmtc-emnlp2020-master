In practice, however, this certificate of conformity is attached to the transport documents and so follows the goods. For administrative reasons, this prevents the operators from availing themselves of the security waiver as provided for by the Regulation. In order to resolve this situation, the conditions under which operators are required to provide the required proof should be changed.\n(2) The first subparagraph of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 provides, in the case of imports of common wheat of high quality, for a special security in addition to those provided for by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice\u00a0(3). The additional security of EUR 95 per tonne is justified by virtue of the difference in customs duties imposed on imports of common wheat depending on whether the wheat is of high quality or low or medium quality. Where customs duties for all quality categories of common wheat have been suspended under Article 187 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 the above-mentioned additional security is no longer justified and so should not be required for the entire period in which the duties are suspended.\n(3) Annex IVb to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 contains a blank certificate of conformity authorised by the government of Canada for exports of common and durum wheat to the European Community and the export grade specifications. By official letter dated 20 May 2008, the Canadian authorities informed the Commission of an amendment to their blank certificate. The blank certificate must therefore be amended.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
