The details of the marking shall be given in the entry for free circulation of the horses  concerned. A copy of this entry shall accompany the horses, and must reach the authority referred  to in Article 4 (1).", "1.  After completion of the customs formalities relating to entry into free circulation,  the horses must be brought directly by means of transport duly sealed by the competent authority,  without prejudice to any national provisions concerning the breaking and replacement of seals in  cases of emergency, to a slaughterhouse recognized by the competent authorities, to be  slaughtered.\n2.  On arrival at the slaughterhouse, the vehicle must be unsealed and the horses discharged in the  presence of the competent authority.\n3.  However, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply when the customs office where the  formalities referred to in paragraph 1 are completed is in the slaughterhouse, if the horses are  immediately taken into the charge of the authority referred to in Article 4 (1).\nMoreover, when the customs office at which the formalities referred to in paragraph 1 are completed  is in the immediate vicinity of the slaughterhouse, the competent authority may, instead of using  seals, take appropriate control measures to ensure that the horses are transferred directly to the  slaughterhouse and are taken into the charge of the authority referred to in Article 4 (1).", "1.  Proof that the horses have been slaughtered must be supplied, either by a  certificate issued by the authority empowered to do so, or by an endorsement added by that  authority to the copy entry referred to in Article 2 (2) which establishes that the identity of the  slaughtered animals conforms with the details set out on the entry into free circulation.\n2.  Within 18 days from the date of acceptance of the entry into free circulation of the horses,  proof that slaughter has taken place must reach the customs office where the said entry was  presented, either directly from the authority referred to in paragraph 1, or, on its behalf, from  the importer, in accordance with the decision of the Member State concerned.", "If on arrival at the slaughterhouse the horse cannot be identified, or the provisions of  Article 3 have not been\nfulfilled, the competent authority must immediately inform the competent  customs authority, which shall take action as necessary.", "1.
