Consequently that zone should be extended, taking into account of the data available on the ecology of the vector and the current meteorological situation.\n(4) On 21 November 2006 Germany informed the Commission of new outbreaks of bluetongue in Lower Saxony. In view of those findings, it is appropriate to amend the demarcation of the restricted zone in Germany.\n(5) Following the notification of outbreaks of bluetongue in early November 2006 by Italy, due to a new serotype, by Decision 2006/858/EC, a new restricted zone G has been added to Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC to include the three concerned provinces of southern Sardinia. However, the reference to this zone in the respective provisions of Decision 2005/393/EC has not been added. Therefore, for the sake of clarity, the list of zones referred to in Article 2 of Decision 2005/393/EC should be completed.\n(6) Decision 2005/393/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/393/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
