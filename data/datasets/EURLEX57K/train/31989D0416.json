Particular emphasis will be placed on awards for training and mobility grants. Such contracts and grants will,  where appropriate, be awarded following a selection procedure based on calls for proposals published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nParticipants in shared-cost contracts may be from public or private research organizations, including universities, established in the Community. Each contractor will be expected to make a significant contribution to projects. The contractor will be  expected to bear a substantial proportion of the costs, 50 % of which will normally be borne by the Community. Alternatively, in respect of universities and similar organizations carrying out projects under this programme, the Community may bear up to  100 % of the additional expenditure involved.\nShared-cost research projects should normally be carried out by participants from more than one Member State.\nThe Commission shall distribute, in all Community languages, information packs to accompany the invitation to participate in order to guarantee equal opportunities for the enterprises, universities and research centres in the Member States.\nThe information resulting from the implementation of the shared-cost activities shall be made accessible on an equal basis to all Member States. Licences and/or other rights developed in the framework of the programme will be subject to Community rules,  and taking into account contractual arrangements.\nANNEX III   PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES AND EVALUATION CRITERIA  The radiation protection programme (1990 to 1991) represents a part of the Community research needs in the field of radiation protection for the period 1990 to 1994, outlined in the Commission's  communication (COM(88) 789 final) and aims, by means of a cooperative European research effort, to provide:\n- the scientific basis for the continued updating of the Basic Safety Standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against dangers of ionizing radiation and the stimulus for the continued development of radiation protection  philosophy and concepts in all Member States, taking into account relative experience in Member States,\n- the scientific knowledge needed to assess the carcinogenic and genetic risks to workers and the general public from exposure to low doses and low dose rates of radiation of different quality arising from natural radiation, medical diagnostic radiology  and nuclear industry,\n- the methods to assess risks from radiation accidents as well as the rationales and techniques for the implementation of countermeasures,\n- the information necessary to expand radiation protection concepts and practices in response to demands created, for example by innovative applications of radiation in medicine and industry,\n- the objective scientific background to help the relevant national authorities reach rational decisions on the operation of the nuclear industry, on the development of environmental criteria for radioactivity on the management of rare emergency  situations, and on the objective information to be given to the public about risks and benefits,\n- the incentive and the support for cooperation between scientists and research institutions from the different Member States, and the advanced training necessary to maintain competence in the Community, including improved and comprehensive training of  young scientists in the field of radiation protection,\n- efficient use and documentation of the knowledge acquired under this and previous Community radiation protection programmes which could contribute to a better common understanding of the scientific issues and lead to improved information to the  general public on these matters.\nThe extent to which the programme attains the above objectives will be evaluated by independent experts in accordance with the Community plan of action relating to the evaluation of Community research and development activities.\nThe major evaluation criteria for the programme are:\n- its scientific and technological contribution to the radiation protection policy of the Community,\n- the relevance of the results of the research carried out in the programme for the continued updating of the Basic Safety Standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against dangers of ionizing radiation and for the  theoretical foundation of radiation protection and its practical applications,\n- the scientific originality of the work, its relevance for the assessment of risks, in particular from low dose and dose rate exposure to natural, medical and man-made sources, and its contribution to the assessment and management of risks of radiation  accidents,\n- the ways by which information from the programme has provided protection concepts and practices in response to demands created by new applications of radiation and has helped relevant national authorities to reach rational decisions on radiation  protection in normal and emergency situations,\n- its role in the dissemination of knowledge,\n- the extent to which the programme has contributed to cooperation among Member States' laboratories, has helped the advanced training of scientists and has promoted dissemination of scientific knowledge in radiation protection,\n- the efficiency of the management.\nIn addition, the criteria set up for the 1988 to 1989 revision (;) should also be considered:\n- whether a significant contribution has been made to the development of more cost-effective techniques to prevent and counter harmful effects of radiation, especially those occurring as a result of hypothetical accidents taking into account the  Chernobyl situation. In particular whether:\n- the reliability of long distance atmospheric transfer models has been improved,\n- improved data and models on the transfer of radionuclides in the food chain have been obtained,\n- the feasibility of epidemiological studies on health effects in the population has been demonstrated or rejected,\n- the radiological consequences of nuclear accident scenarios have become better understood,\n- the scientific basis of the underlying data for derived emergency reference levels has been developed,\n- practical countermeasures with respect to the agricultural and aquatic environment, the urban environment and preventive medication have been improved,\n- better methods for monitoring and surveillance in accidental situations have been found,\n- the treatment methodologies and diagnosis of exposed persons have advanced.\n(;) OJ No L 16, 21. 1. 1988, p. 44."}
