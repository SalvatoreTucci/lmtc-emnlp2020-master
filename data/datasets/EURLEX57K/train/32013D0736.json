On the basis of Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC, the Member State concerned has to designate the sites included in the list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region as special areas of conservation as soon as possible and within six years at most, establishing conservation priorities and the necessary conservation measures.\n(4) In the context of a dynamic adaptation of the Natura 2000 network, the lists of sites of Community importance are reviewed. An update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region is therefore necessary.\n(5) On the one hand, the update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region is necessary in order to include additional sites that have been proposed since 2011 by Romania as sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 92/43/EEC. For those additional sites, the obligations resulting from Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC should apply as soon as possible and within six years at most from the adoption of this Decision.\n(6) On the other hand, the update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region is necessary in order to reflect any changes in site-related information submitted by Romania following the adoption of the initial and the first updated Union lists. In that sense, the updated list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region constitutes a consolidated version of the list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region. It should be stressed that, for any site included in this Decision, the obligations resulting from Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC should apply as soon as possible and within six years at most from the adoption of the list of sites of Community importance in which the site was included for the first time.\n(7) For the Steppic biogeographical region, lists of sites proposed as sites of Community importance within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 92/43/EEC were transmitted to the Commission between June 2007 and October 2012 in accordance with Article 4(1) of that Directive.\n(8) The lists of proposed sites were accompanied by information on each site. Since 2012, that information was supplied in the format established by Commission Implementing Decision 2011/484/EU of 11 July 2011 concerning a site information format for Natura 2000 sites\u00a0(4).\n(9) That information includes the map of the site transmitted by the Member State concerned, name, location and extent of the site, and the data yielded by application of the criteria specified in Annex III to Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(10) On the basis of the draft list drawn up by the Commission in agreement with the Member State concerned, which also identifies sites hosting priority natural habitat types or priority species, an updated list of sites selected as sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeograpical region should be adopted.\n(11) Knowledge of the existence and distribution of the natural habitat types and species is constantly evolving as a result of the surveillance undertaken in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 92/43/EEC. Therefore, the evaluation and selection of sites at Union level was carried out using the best available information at the time.\n(12) The Member State concerned has not proposed sufficient sites to meet the requirements of Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species. For those habitat types and species it can therefore not be concluded that the Natura 2000 network is complete. Taking into account the delay in receiving the information and reaching agreement with the Member State, it is necessary to adopt an updated list of sites which will need to be reviewed in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(13) Given that knowledge of the existence and distribution of some of the natural habitat types listed in Annex I and some of the species listed in Annex II to Directive 92/43/EEC remains incomplete, it should not be concluded that the network is either complete or incomplete. The list should be reviewed, if necessary, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.\n(14) In the interests of clarity and transparency, Implementing Decision 2013/28/EU should be repealed.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Habitats Committee,", "main_body": ["The second updated list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 92/43/EEC is set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "Implementing Decision 2013/28/EU is repealed.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nJanez POTO\u010cNIK\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p. 117.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 26.1.2013, p. 643.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 30.7.2011, p. 39.\nANNEX\nSecond updated list of sites of Community importance for the Steppic biogeographical region\nEach site of Community importance (SCI) is identified by the information supplied in the Natura 2000 format, including the corresponding map.
