However, that Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.\n(2) In the Republic of South Africa, the multiplication of plants of Fragaria L., intended for planting, other than seeds, from plants supplied by a Member State, has become an established practice.
