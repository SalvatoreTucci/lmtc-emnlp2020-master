A new \"old-for-new\" ratio should therefore be set for the year 2000.\n(4) Economic developments in the various sectors of the inland waterways transport market make it expedient to reduce the various \"old-for-new\" ratios mentioned in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 and set by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 805/1999, though without undoing the achievements of the structural improvement carried out since 1990. The ratio for dry cargo carriers should be reduced to 0,80:1, as the sector is continuing to grow; the ratio for tanker vessels requires a smaller adjustment, to 1,15:1, as the situation in this sector remains worrying and the market is not growing; a larger adjustment is required for the pusher craft ratio, to 0,50:1, as overcapacity is not great in this sector.\n(5) The measures laid down in this Regulation have been the subject of an opinion from the Group of Experts on Community Fleets Capacity and Promotion Policy set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 805/1999,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 805/1999 is amended as follows:\n1. In Article 4(1), the ratio \"1:1\" is replaced by \"0,80:1\".\n2. In Article 4(2), the ratio \"1,30:1\" is replaced by \"1,15:1\".\n3.
