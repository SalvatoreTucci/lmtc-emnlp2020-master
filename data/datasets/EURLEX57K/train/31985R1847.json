whereas, in accordance with Article 17 of the same Regulation, the list of representative producer markets for these products must be drawn up; whereas, for the purposes of compiling this list, only those markets in the Member States in which, for a given product, a large proportion of national production is marketed throughout the marketing year, or during one of the periods in which the marketing year has been subdivided, should be taken into account;\nWhereas the list of representative producer markets has been amended many times since it was fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 604/71 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1341/82 (4); whereas, as a result, details of these markets are at present scattered throughout several separate regulations drawn up at different times; whereas in these circumstances, on account of their dispersion, these texts do not possess the clarity which all regulations should exhibit;
