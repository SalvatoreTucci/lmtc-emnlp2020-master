amended by Directive 98/96/EC(2), and in particular Article 17 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed(3), as last amended by Directive 1999/54/EC(4), and in particular Article 17 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 69/208/EEC of 30 June 1969 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants(5), as last amended by Directive 98/96/EC, and in particular Article 16 thereof,\nHaving regard to the notifications regarding supply difficulties of seed submitted by various Member States,\nWhereas:\n(1) In Germany the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field bean which satisfies the requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(2) In France the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field pea which satisfies the requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(3) In Luxembourg the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field bean which satisfies the requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(4) In the Netherlands the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of wheat which satisfies the requirements of Directive 66/402/EEC is insufficient in relation to the examination of the satisfaction of the conditions to be satisfied by the crop and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(5) In Austria the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field bean, blue lupin and soya bean which satisfies the requirements of Directives 66/401/EEC or 69/208/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(6) In Finland the quantity of available seed of linseed which satisfies the requirements of Directive 69/208/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(7) In Sweden the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field bean which satisfies the requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(8) In the United Kingdom the quantity of available seed of soya bean which satisfies the requirements of Directive 69/208/EEC is insufficient in relation to the germination capacity and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs.\n(9) It is not possible to cover these demands satisfactorily with seed from other Member States, or from non-member countries, satisfying all the requirements laid down in the Directives.\n(10) The Member States should therefore permit, for a period expiring on 30 June 2001, the marketing of seed subject to less stringent requirements.\n(11) Moreover, the Member States which have notified the supply difficulties of seed should act as coordinators in order to ensure that the total amount covered by the permits does not exceed the maximum quantity covered by this Decision.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["The Member States shall permit, for a period expiring on 30 June 2001, on the terms set out in the Annex hereto, the
