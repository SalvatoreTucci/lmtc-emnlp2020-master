The revision is a consequence of the experience gained in 2010 and 2011 from the verification of the eligibility conditions for the single area payment under the single area payment scheme, which has shown that the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 was less than previously estimated. The agricultural area for the single area payment scheme should therefore be reduced to 14\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0ha.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The amendment proposed by this Regulation should apply to premium periods starting from 1 January 2012.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["In Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009, the row concerning Poland is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Poland 14\u00a0000\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to aid applications relating to premium periods starting from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a030, 31.1.2009, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0316, 2.12.2009, p.\u00a027."}
