Article 1 (3) is deleted.\n2. The following new Article 4a is inserted:\n'Article 4a\n1. As from the 1990/91 marketing year, the amount of the production refund per 100 kilograms of white sugar shall be fixed taking into account the world market price for white sugar plus a standard amount of ECU 7 per 100 kilograms of white sugar and the price of Community sugar.\n2. For the purpose of implementing paragraph1, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) world market price for sugar: the price of Community sugar less the average of the export refunds for white sugar recorded during the reference period in question after deduction of a standard amount of ECU 7 per 100 kilograms;\n(b) price of Community sugar: the intervention price for white sugar plus the storage levy.'", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 26 June 1990.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
