For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned.\n(2) The budgetary ceilings for the support provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for calendar year 2012 are set out in Annex III to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012\u00a0(2).\n(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1270/2012\u00a0(3) provides certain derogations for Portugal as regards the deadline for reviewing its decision on specific support for 2012, as regards the deadline for notification of such review, as regards the conditions applicable to specific agricultural activities entailing additional agri-environment benefits and as regards the information contained in the aid application.\n(4) On 4 January 2013, Portugal has informed the Commission of the amended support measures which it intends to apply for 2012.\n(5) According to the information submitted, Portugal intends:\n\u2014 to amend the current support measure under Article 68(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in the dairy sector by increasing the envelope allocated to that measure from EUR 8,8\u00a0million to EUR 10,32\u00a0million in 2012,\n\u2014 to amend the current support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 by restricting its scope to bovine females of the \u2018Brava de Lide\u2019 breed reducing the respective envelope by EUR 2,53\u00a0million,\n\u2014 to introduce a new support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for the maintaining of certain autochthonous breeds of beef (\u2018Alentejana\u2019, \u2018Mertolenga\u2019), sheep (\u2018Serra de Estrela\u2019, \u2018Churra de Terra Quente\u2019) and goat (\u2018Serrana\u2019), with a total allocated envelope of EUR 1,68\u00a0million, and\n\u2014 to reduce the envelope of a measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for extensive pasturing by EUR 0,67\u00a0million.\n(6) Those amendments affect the level of support provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, and thus the budgetary ceiling for Portugal set out in Annex III to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012.\n(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly. As the amendments apply for the year 2012, it is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force immediately.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["In Annex III to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012, the row concerning Portugal is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Portugal 20\u00a0200\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 168, 28.6.2012, p. 26.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 357, 28.12.2012, p. 7."}
