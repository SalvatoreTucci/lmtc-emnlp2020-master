Availability of  concentrated inactivated antigen suitable for storage in liquid nitrogen, or by a method giving at  least equivalent stability.\n2.  Availability of antigen corresponding to each of the sub-types specified in Annex I. The  antigen must also be suitable for the preparation of oil emulsion vaccines for pigs, in which case  ;/6 of a dose volume must protect at least 5 out of 10 pigs if challenged by intrapodal injection  of 1 000 ID50.\n3.  Full information should be provided on the tests conducted by the producer on seed virus, cells  and other materials used in the production.\nSamples of each master seed virus must be submitted to the CCI for confirmatory tests of identity  and purity.\nSamples of the cells used to produce the virus should be submitted to the CCI.\n4.\nThe manufacture and quality of antigen must be consistent with the generally accepted standards for  good manufacturing practice in Europe.\nThe vaccines to be produced on the basis of the antigen must comply with the requirements of the  European Pharmacopoeia. In addition:\n(a)  the antigen shall have been inactivated before concentration using a first order inactivant.  For each batch of antigen the kinetics of inactivation must be followed and documented by the  producer. The range of inactivation must be such that the batch as a whole is free from infective  virus, and the safety margin should be in the range of about 3 log10 (based on extrapolation);  and\n(b)\nthe mixture of virus preparation/inactivant must have been transferred to a second sterile  container when half of the inactivation time has elapsed in such a manner as to prevent  contamination; an equivalent method could, however, be acceptable; and\n(c)\nsubsequent processing of  the antigen should be carried out in a non-contaminated environment (FMD virus free).  Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) precipitation, polyethyleneoxide (PEO) precipitation, ultrafiltration or a  combination of these are permitted methods for the concentration of inactivated antigen;  and\n(d)\nbefore and during the performance of innocuity tests, the inactivated antigen should be  stored in a sealed container, in a quarantine area, outside the restricted (high-security) area;  and\n(e)\nthe concentrated product containing the inactivated antigen should be in a volume at least  100 times less than that used for formulation of conventional vaccines. The producer must indicate  the number of vaccine doses per volume unit of concentrated material; and\n(f)\nthe main bulk of the  inactivated antigen should be supplied in containers suitable for storage over liquid nitrogen and  divided into volumes to be agreed between the producer and the CCI.\nIn consultation with, and under the supervision of, the CCI, the producer must also provide 20  representative samples containing at least 1 mg each of concentrated 146S antigen for periodic in  vitro and in vivo tests; and\n(g)\nthe producer must provide relevant information about the antigen  and its formulation into vaccine for consideration by the CCI.\n5.\n(a)\nOn receipt, each batch of concentrated inactivated antigen will be checked by the CCI for  possible residual infective virus in vitro and in cattle using the method prescribed for vaccine in  the European Pharmacopoeia; and\n(b)\npotency of the vaccines prepared from the concentrated antigen  will be tested by the CCI. Vaccines will be formulated according to the prescription of the  producer. Vaccines for pigs will be formulated as oil emulsions. For cattle, aluminium-hydroxide-,  saponin- or oil-adjuvanted vaccines may be used. Any batches found to be unsatisfactory when tested  immediately upon reconstitution following deposit in the antigen bank will be rejected and be  replaced at the producer's expense. The cost of testing the replacement batch will be met by the  producer;\n(c)\ncomponents of the concentrated antigen must not interfere with the preparation and stability of  the oil-emulsion vaccines.\n6.\nThe antigen as provided by the producer should have an expected stability of at least five years.\n7.\n(a)\nThe concentration and quality of the vaccine adjuvants will be agreed with the CCI.\n(b)\nThe producer should also specify the expected shelf-life of the product after formulation into  vaccine. This shelf-life should be at least four months.\n8.\nVaccines which have exceeded their expiry date must not be used; this date can be checked and if  necessary reviewed by the CCI.\n9.\nFormulated vaccines must be kept under cool temperature conditions as specified in the European  Pharmacopoeia. Care should be taken to maintain the correct temperature during distribution, until  administered."}
