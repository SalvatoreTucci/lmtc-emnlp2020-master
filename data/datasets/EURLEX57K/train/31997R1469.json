However, no increase shall apply to transfers executed to a particular area where environmental objectives are achieved.", "Should the base area under the 1997/1998 marketing year be exceeded, the special set-aside referred to in the second indent of Article 2 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 shall not apply.", "For the 1997/1998 marketing year, notwithstanding the sixth subparagraph of Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, where an 'irrigated` ceiling is exceeded, the compensatory payment for the 'irrigated` rate shall in all cases be reduced proportionally to the rate of the overshoot recorded.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 July 1997.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
