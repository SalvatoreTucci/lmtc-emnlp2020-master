In order to avoid that these reference quantities are calculated on the basis of historic data which no longer reflect a genuine economic activity, it is appropriate to provide that the reference quantity should be the average of the quantities of garlic actually imported by a traditional importer during the three years which preceded the related import tariff quota period.\n(5) In order to ensure efficient market management, it is appropriate to provide for a time period during which applications for \u2018A\u2019 licences may be lodged which would be chronologically close to the subperiod for which the applications are lodged.\n(6) For the purpose of improving control and in order to allow a rapid reaction from the competent authorities in case of errors or malfunctioning of the system, the Member States should notify the Commission of the quantities for which licence applications have been lodged for the relevant subperiod.\n(7) The reference to working days when calculating the time periods could lead to different situations among the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to use calendar days instead.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) This Regulation should apply from 1 May 2010. However, in order to ensure that importers have sufficient time to adapt themselves to the new legal framework, the new provisions concerning the calculation of the reference period and the submission of proof of the actually imported garlic should only apply from 1 February 2011.\n(10) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
