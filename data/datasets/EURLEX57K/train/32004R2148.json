Such applications therefore shall continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) The use of the product, clinoptilolite of volcanic origin, as feed additive belonging to the category of \u2018binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants\u2019, was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for pigs, rabbits and poultry by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1245/1999\u00a0(3).\n(6) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation have been satisfied.\n(7) Accordingly, the use of this product, clinoptilolite of volcanic origin, should be authorised without a time limit, under certain conditions set out in Annex I to this Regulation.\n(8) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Bacillus licheniformis (DSM\u00a05749) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM\u00a05750) was provisionally authorised for pigs for fattening and without a time limit for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2437/2000\u00a0(4).\n(9) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of that micro-organism preparation for pigs for fattening. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. New data were submitted in support of the application to modify the maximum age of that micro-organism preparation for piglets. The assessment shows that the conditions for such modification of the authorisation are satisfied.\n(10) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98\u00a0(5).\n(11) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium (DSM 7134) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (DSM 7133) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2690/99\u00a0(6).\n(12) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of those two micro-organism preparations. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.\n(13) Accordingly, the use of those three micro-organism preparations, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(14) Data were submitted in support of an application to obtain an authorisation for a new additive belonging to the group micro-organisms, Kluyveromyces marxianus variety lactisK1 (BCCM/MUCL 39434) for dairy cows.\n(15) The assessment of the application for authorisation submitted, in respect of the micro-organism preparation specified in Annex III to this Regulation, shows that the conditions referred to in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC are satisfied.\n(16) The Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) has delivered an opinion on the use of this additive in feedingstuffs \u2018Opinion on the use of certain micro-organisms as additives in feedingstuffs\u2019 on 25 April 2003, which concludes that this additive does not present a risk to animal health, human health or the environment, under the conditions set out in Annex III to this Regulation.\n(17) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10\u00a0W) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98.\n(18) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI SD 142) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 (liquid form) and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1353/2000\u00a0(7) (solid form).\n(19) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (IMI SD 135) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for chickens for fattening, by Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 (liquid form) and by Regulation (EC) No 1353/2000 (solid form).\n(20) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation without a time limit of those three enzyme preparations. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.\n(21) Accordingly, the use of those three enzyme preparations as specified in Annex IV, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(22) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Penicillium funiculosum (IMI SD 101) is authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004\u00a0(8). The use of this preparation was provisionally authorised for turkeys for fattening, for laying hens and for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001\u00a0(9).\n(23) New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to piglets and ducks for fattening.\n(24) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that this preparation does not present a risk for these additional animal categories, under the conditions set out in Annex V to this Regulation.\n(25) The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of such preparation have been satisfied.\n(26) Accordingly, the use of this enzyme preparation as specified in Annex V, should be provisionally authorised for four years.\n(27) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(10).\n(28) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nThe preparation belonging to the group \u2018Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants\u2019, is authorised for use without a time limit as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex I.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex II.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Micro-organisms\u2019, is authorised provisionally for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex III.", "The preparations belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, are authorised for use without a time limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex IV.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Enzymes\u2019, is authorised provisionally for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in Annex V.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
