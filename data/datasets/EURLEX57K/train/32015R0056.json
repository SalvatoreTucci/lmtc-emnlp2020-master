This is the case in particular in relation to the first introduction into the Union of hunting trophies of specimens of some species or populations listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 338/97, for which there are concerns as to the sustainability of trade in hunting trophies or for which there are indications of significant illegal trade. In such cases, more stringent control of imports into the Union is necessary and the derogation set out in Article\u00a07(3) of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 for personal and household effects should therefore not apply. Experience in implementing Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 has also shown that it was necessary to clarify that import permits should not be issued by Member States in cases where, despite a request to this end, they do not obtain satisfactory information from the exporting or re-exporting country as to the legality of the specimens to be imported into the EU.\n(4) At the sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the standard references for nomenclature were updated. These references are used to indicate scientific names of species in permits and certificates. Those changes should be reflected in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 865/2006.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) As this Regulation should be used in conjunction with Regulation (EU) No 792/2012, it is important that both Regulations apply as of the same day.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is amended as follows:\n(a) point (1) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(1)
