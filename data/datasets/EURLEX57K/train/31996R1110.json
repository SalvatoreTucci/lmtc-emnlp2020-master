whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed the traditional annual level of imports and the absorption capacity of the Community market; whereas, therefore, the beef and veal market would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering, in particular, market prices and producers' incomes;\nWhereas, however, it is necessary to take into account the application of the Agreement concluded during the WTO multilateral trade negotiations; whereas the management measures provided for should therefore be restricted to products from the third countries to which the Community grants preferential treatment and which have accepted that the Community take measures to manage the importation of the animals in question;\nWhereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1996 is estimated at 425 000 head other than pure bred breeding animals; whereas, in view of imports planned under certain preferential arrangements for 1996, i.e. 300 500 head under the quota established in the context of the Uruguay Round concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for fattening and under the Europe Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria and the agreements on free trade and trade-related measures with the Baltic Republics, 124 500 head should be admitted for import in 1996 at the full or reduced rate of import duty, as the case may be.\nWhereas, in respect of the first half of 1996, Commission Regulation (EC) No 3018/95 (11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 425/96 (12), and (EC) No 403/96 (13) have already provided for imports of 89 000 head; whereas management measures should be taken for imports of the remaining 35 500 head in the second half of 1996 with, as countries of origin, the aforementioned countries;\nWhereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria;\nWhereas, in order to take account to the greatest extent of the traditional structure of the Community veal market, imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported or imported during 1995 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State;\nWhereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers, therefore, imports carried out between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1995 from countries considered third countries depending on the year of importation should be taken into account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities reserved for traditional importers;\nWhereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1996;\nWhereas the quota in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be set on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, by way of derogation, if necessary, from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (15), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (16), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2856/95 (17); whereas it should moreover be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and where necessary with a flat-rate percentage reduction applied;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Imports into the Community during the second half of 1996 at the full duty rate provided for in the Common Customs Tariff of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 21, 0102 90 29, 0102 90 41 and 0102 90 49, as referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (18), originating in the third countries listed in Annex I, shall be subject to the management measures laid down in this Regulation.", "1.
