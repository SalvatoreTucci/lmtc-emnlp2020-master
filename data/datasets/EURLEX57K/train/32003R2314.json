This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of rye held by the German intervention agency available on the internal market. The period of presentation of the offers for the last partial invitation to tender under Regulation (EC) No 1510/2003\u00a0(3) having expired on 18 December 2003, it is advisable to open a new standing invitation to tender.\n(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(6) When the German intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["The German intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 1\u00a0139\u00a0000 tonnes of rye held by it.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding that Regulation:\n(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.", "Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security is set at EUR\u00a010 per tonne.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The closing date for the submission of tenders for the first partial invitation to tender shall be 8 January 2004 at 09.00 (Brussels time).\nThe closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Thursday at 09.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 8 April and 20 May 2004.\nThe closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial tendering procedure shall be 27 May 2004 at 09.00 (Brussels time).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be lodged with the German intervention agency:\nBundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und Ern\u00e4hrung (BLE)\nAdickesallee 40\nD-60322\u00a0Frankfurt am Main\nFax: (49-691) 56\u00a049\u00a062", "Within two hours of the expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders, the German intervention agency shall notify the Commission of tenders received.
