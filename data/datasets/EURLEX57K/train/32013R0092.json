It is this amount that should have been taken into account to fix the Spanish final quota of SBR/*678- to be deducted according to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 700/2012.\n(9) The deduction applied to the Spanish quota of SBR/*678- should be reduced accordingly.\n(10) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 700/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly and the amendments should have retroactive effect to the date of entry into force of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 700/2012 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 7 August 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 203, 31.7.2012, p. 52.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 336, 21.12.2010, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 190, 21.7.2011, p. 2.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 700/2012 is amended as follows:\n(a) on page 56, the line hereunder\n\u2018ES SBR *678- Red seabream EU and international waters of VI, VII and VIII 49,12 62,30 126,8\u00a0% 13,18 1   13,18\u2019\n\u2018ES SBR *678- Red seabream EU and international waters of VI, VII and VIII 57,12 62,30 109\u00a0% 5,18 1   5,18\u2019\n(b) on page 58, the four lines hereunder are deleted\n\u2018PT COD N3M.
