However, these are in fact not protocols of agreement but agreements.\n(2) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU provides for the setting-up of a centre to monitor the security of the system and the services provided, known as the \u2018Galileo Security Centre (GSMC)\u2019. The French version of the Annex to the Decision specifies that the creation of this centre will be the subject of protocols of agreement between France and the United Kingdom to be signed during 2012.\n(3) In fact, the protocols of agreement between France and the United Kingdom for the creation of the Galileo Security Centre were not signed in 2012, but agreements should be signed in 2013.\n(4) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU also provides for the development of a \u2018GNSS service centre (GSC)\u2019 in Madrid, to act as the interface between the system, on the one side, and the users of the open service, the commercial service and the Safety of Life Service on the other. The French version of the Annex to the Decision specifies that the creation of this centre was the subject of a protocol of agreement signed with Spain on 17 March 2011.\n(5) In fact, the text signed on 17 March 2011 was not a protocol of agreement but merely a memorandum of understanding. The development of the GSC should, however, be the subject of an agreement with Spain in 2013.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU also provides for the development of a centre, known as the \u2018Galileo performance centre\u2019, which, on behalf of the programme manager and independently of the user, evaluates the quality of the services provided and communicates time and geodetic references to the user communities.\n(7) For reasons relating to the nature of the functions of the Galileo performance centre, the name of the centre as shown in the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU should be amended to \u2018Galileo reference centre\u2019 (\u2018GRC\u2019). Furthermore, in the light of the presence of existing installations and equipment suitable for the tasks assigned to the Galileo reference centre, the security needs, and the technical and budgetary constraints linked to its operation, it would seem that the ESTEC site in Noordwijk, in the Netherlands, owned by the European Space Agency, is best placed to host the centre. It must be pointed out that the Galileo reference centre should not overlap with the instruments already in place in the Member States. Lastly, the development of the centre will not be completed in 2014 but only in 2016.\n(8) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU further provides for the creation of a series of Galileo distance survey centres, known as \u2018GSS stations\u2019 which, to allow the provision of services, carry out pseudo-distance measuring and collect the signals sent by the satellites to monitor their quality. The optimum distribution around the globe of these stations should take account of geographical limitations.\n(9) The series of GSS stations does not include any stations in the North Pacific area. As it is essential that this area also be covered, a GSS station should be set up there. The said station is planned for Tokyo, in Japan, in the Belgian embassy, should the results of the feasibility studies prove positive.\n(10) The Annex to implementing Decision 2012/117/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in the row relating to the creation of the Galileo security centre (GSMC), in the \u2018Measures\u2019 column, the words \u2018of protocols of agreement\u2019 appearing in the French version are replaced by the words \u2018of agreements\u2019 and the year \u20182012\u2019 is replaced by the year \u20182013\u2019;\n(2) in the row relating to the development of a GNSS service centre (GSC), in the \u2018Measures\u2019 column, the sentence \u2018It is the subject of an agreement signed with Spain on 17 March 2011\u2019 is replaced with the sentence \u2018It is the subject of a memorandum of understanding signed with Spain on 17 March 2011 and is expected to be the subject of an agreement with Spain to be signed during 2013\u2019;\n(3) in the row relating to the development of an SAR service centre, in the \u2018Measures\u2019 column the words \u2018of a protocol of agreement\u2019 appearing in the French version are replaced by the words \u2018of an agreement\u2019;\n(4) the row relating to the development of a Galileo performance centre is amended as follows:\n(a) in the \u2018Date\u2019 column, the years \u20182013-2014\u2019 are replaced by the years \u20182013-2016\u2019;\n(b) in the \u2018Key decision-making point\u2019 column, the words \u2018Development of a Galileo performance centre\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018Development of a Galileo reference centre\u2019;\n(c) in the \u2018Measures\u2019 column, the sentences \u2018The Galileo performance centre should be developed in stages in a Member State and at a location to be determined.
