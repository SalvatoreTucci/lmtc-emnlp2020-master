In particular, Member States must make available in their so-called \u2018trusted lists\u2019 information on certification service providers issuing qualified certificates to the public in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures\u00a0(3) and supervised/accredited by them and on the services they offer.\n(2) A number of practical tests with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) have been organised to allow Member States to check the conformity of their trusted lists with the specifications set out in the Annex to Decision 2009/767/EC. These tests have demonstrated that some technical changes are needed in the technical specifications in the Annex to Decision 2009/767/EC, to ensure functioning and interoperable trusted lists.\n(3) These tests also confirmed the need for Member States to make publicly available not only the human readable versions of their trusted lists as required by Decision 2009/767/EC but also the machine processable forms of these. The manual use of the human readable form of the trusted lists can be relatively complex and time consuming when Member States have a high number of certification service providers. The publication of the machine processable forms of trusted lists will facilitate their use by allowing for their automated processing and thereby enhance their use in public electronic services.\n(4) In order to facilitate access to the national trusted lists, Member States should notify to the Commission information related to the location and protection of their trusted lists. This information should be made available by the Commission to other Member States in a secure manner.\n(5) The results of these practical tests on Member States\u2019 trusted lists should be taken into account in order to allow for an automated use of the lists and to facilitate access to them.\n(6) Decision 2009/767/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) For the purpose of allowing Member States to carry out the required technical changes to their current trusted lists it is appropriate that this Decision applies as of 1 December 2010.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Services Directive Committee,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Decision 2009/767/EC\nDecision 2009/767/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
