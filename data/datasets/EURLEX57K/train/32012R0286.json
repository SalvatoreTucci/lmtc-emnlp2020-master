Textile products may be made available on the market within the Union only if they comply with the provisions of that Regulation.\n(2) Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 requires labelling to indicate the fibre composition of textile products, with checks being carried out by analysis on the conformity of those products with indications given on the label.\n(3) It is necessary, for the purposes of adapting Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 to technical progress, to add the fibre polypropylene/polyamide bicomponent to the lists of textile fibre names set out in Annexes I and IX to that Regulation.\n(4) Uniform methods for quantitative analysis of binary textile fibre mixtures are provided for in Annex VIII to Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to define uniform test methods for polypropylene/polyamide bicomponent.\n(6) Directive 96/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2), as amended by Commission Directive 2011/74/EU\u00a0(3), and Directive 2008/121/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), as amended by Commission Directive 2011/73/EU\u00a0(5), include the textile fibre name polypropylene/polyamide bicomponent. As Directives 96/73/EC and 2008/121/EC are repealed by Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 with effect from 8 May 2012, it is necessary to include that textile fibre name in Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 with effect from that date.\n(7) Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, VIII and IX to Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 are amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 8 May 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 January 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 272, 18.10.2011, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 32, 3.2.1997, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 30.7.2011, p. 32.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 19, 23.1.2009, p. 29.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 30.7.2011, p. 30.\nANNEX\nAnnexes I, VIII and IX to Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 are amended as follows:\n(1) in Annex I, the following row 49 is added:\n\u201849 Polypropylene/polyamide bicomponent a bicomponent fibre composed of between 10\u00a0% and 25\u00a0% by mass of polyamide fibrils embedded in polypropylene matrix\u2019;\n(2) Chapter 2 of Annex VIII is amended as follows:\n(a) the summary table is replaced by the following:\nMethod Field of application\u00a0(1) Reagent\nSoluble component Insoluble component\n1.
