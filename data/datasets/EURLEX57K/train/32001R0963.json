Therefore the Commission shall appraise the proposed measures in compliance with Article 33(2)(a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999 of 23 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)\u00a0(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 672/2001\u00a0(4).\n(2) It is necessary to fix the time limits referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 governing the availability of the additional Community support. The limits should allow sufficient time for Member States to use the additional Community support.\n(3) Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 provides for the use of amounts made available from payment reduction for certain additional measures to existing rural development measures. This support could consist either in support for additional beneficiaries of existing measures, including beneficiaries of new commitments for additional actions in the framework of existing measures, or in support for additional measures. It should, however, not be used for simply increasing Community co-financing rates of measures already foreseen in the rural development programming documents. To ensure traceability, the financing source for a multiannual action undertaken by a beneficiary must remain the same until the end of this undertaking.\n(4) In order for the Commission to be fully informed of the measures taken by Member States to implement Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999, pursuant to Article 9 thereof, rules concerning the content and timing of communications should be adopted.\n(5) The joint committee drawn from the Management Committees set up by Article 42 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999\u00a0(5) and the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation of agricultural markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Additional Community support\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amounts withheld in accordance with Article 3(2) and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 shall be used for the payment of additional Community support provided for in Article 5(2) of that Regulation at the latest by the end of the third financial year following that during which they are withheld.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The additional Community support to one or more of the four measures referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 shall consist in a support granted:\n(a) to additional beneficiaries of existing measures included in rural development programming documents as referred to in Article 44(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999; and/or,\n(b) to additional measures to be included in rural development programming documents.\nThe percentage of Community contribution to such additional support shall be the same as that provided in the rural development programming document for the measure concerned.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A multiannual action undertaken by a beneficiary shall not be alternately funded one year by the Community support as referred to in Article 33(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999 and another year by the additional Community support provided for in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999.", "Transmission of information to the Commission\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate to the Commission in respect of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999, and in respect of each of the sectors listed in the Annex to that Regulation:\n(a) an analysis of the situation of the agricultural land used and the production concerned with reference to the potential environmental effects;\n(b) a detailed description of the appropriate environmental measures envisaged by Article 3(1) of that Regulation which they have taken in the light of the analysis referred to in point (a);\n(c) a detailed description of the penalties which they have decided in accordance with Article 3(2) of that Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Member States choose to implement Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999, they shall communicate a detailed description of the measures adopted to this end.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall communicate a detailed description of any other measures adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The descriptions referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall refer to all relevant legislation of the Member State and/or the Community.
