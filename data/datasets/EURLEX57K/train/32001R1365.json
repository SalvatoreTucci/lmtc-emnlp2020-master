The second paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1289/2001, which limits the term of validity of these export licences, should therefore be replaced.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.\n(5) In order to avoid a difference in treatment between the export licences issued before and after the date of entry into force of this Regulation, the Regulation should apply to licences issued on or after the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1289/2001 entered into force.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The second paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1289/2001 is replaced by the following: \"Where an export licence for which the refund amount was fixed in accordance with the first paragraph is used after 30 September 2001, the refund in question shall be reduced by EUR 2/100 kg net white sugar equivalent.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 5 July 2001.
