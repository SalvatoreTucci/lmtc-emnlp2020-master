Article 37 of that Regulation provides for actions to be taken against fishing vessels included in that list.\n(2) The Union list of IUU fishing vessels is set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No\u00a0468/2010\u00a0(2).\n(3) According to Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01005/2008, the Union list should comprise fishing vessels included in the IUU vessel lists adopted by regional fisheries management organisations.\n(4) According to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01005/2008, upon the receipt from regional fisheries management organisations of the lists of fishing vessels presumed or confirmed to be involved in IUU fishing, the Commission shall update the Union list.\n(5) The Commission has received the updated lists from the annual meetings of the regional fisheries management organisations.\n(6) Considering that the same vessel might be listed under different names and/or flags depending on the time of its inclusion on the regional fisheries management organisations lists, the updated Union list should include the different names and/or flags as established by the respective regional fisheries management organisations.\n(7) Regulation (EU) No\u00a0468/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture,",
