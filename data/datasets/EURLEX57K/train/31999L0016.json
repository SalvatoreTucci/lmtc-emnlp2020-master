APPLICATION FOR EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL\n1.1. The application for EC component type-approval pursuant to Article 3(4) of Directive 70/156/EEC of a type of parking lamp shall be submitted by the manufacturer.\n1.2. A model for the information document is given in Appendix 1.\n1.3. The following must be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the type-approval tests:\n1.3.1. Two samples, equipped with the lamp or lamps recommended; if the parking lamps are such that they can be mounted only on one side of the vehicle, the two samples submitted may be identical and be suitable for mounting only on the right or only on the left side of the vehicle.\n2. MARKINGS\n2.1. The devices submitted for EC component type approval must bear:\n2.1.1. the trade name or mark of the manufacturer;\n2.1.2. in the case of lamps with replaceable light sources: the type(s) of filament lamp prescribed;\n2.1.3. in the case of lamps with non-replaceable light sources: the nominal voltage and wattage.\n2.2. These markings shall be clearly legible and indelible and shall be affixed to the illuminating surface, or to one of the illuminating surfaces, of the device. They shall be visible from the exterior when the device is fitted to the vehicle.\n2.3. Each device shall have sufficient space for the component type-approval mark. This space shall be indicated on the drawings referred to in Appendix 1.\n3. GRANTING OF EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL\n3.1. If the relevant requirements are satisfied, EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(3) and, if applicable, Article 4(4) of Directive 70/156/EEC shall be granted.\n3.2. A model for the EC type-approval certificate is given in Appendix 2.\n3.3. An approval number in accordance with Annex VII to Directive 70/156/EEC shall be assigned to each type of parking lamp approved. The same Member State shall not assign the same number to another type of parking lamp.\n3.4. Where EC component type approval is requested for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a parking lamp and other lamps, a single EC component type-approval number may be assigned provided that the parking lamp complies with the requirements of this Directive and that each of the other lamps forming part of the lighting and light-signalling device for which EC component type approval is requested complies with the separate Directive applying to it.\n4. EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK\n4.1. In addition to the markings referred to in item 2.1., every parking lamp conforming to the type approved pursuant to this Directive shall bear an EC component type-approval mark.\n4.2. This mark shall consist of:\n4.2.1. a rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing number or letters of the Member State which has granted type approval:\n1 for Germany\n2 for France\n3 for Italy\n4 for the Netherlands\n5 for Sweden\n6 for Belgium\n9 for Spain\n11 for the United Kingdom\n12 for Austria\n13 for Luxembourg\n17 for Finland\n18 for Denmark\n21 for Portugal\n23 for Greece\nIRL for Ireland;\n4.2.2. in the vicinity of the rectangle the \"base approval number\" contained in section 4 of the type-approval number referred to in Annex VII of Directive 70/156/EEC, preceded by the two figures indicating the sequence number assigned to the most recent major technical amendment to Directive 77/540/EEC on the date EEC type-approval was granted. In this Directive the sequence number is 00;\n4.2.3. when a lamp emits a light of amber colour towards the front and rear, the lamp must be marked with an arrow indicating its orientation, the arrow showing to the front of the vehicle.\n4.3. The EC component type-approval mark shall be affixed to the lens of the lamp or one of the lenses in such a way as to be indelible and clearly legible even when the lamps are fitted to the vehicle.\n4.4. An example of the EC component type-approval mark is given in Appendix 3.\n4.5. Where a single EC component type-approval number is issued, as per item 3.4. above, for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a parking lamp and other lamps, a single EC component type-approval mark may be affixed, consisting of:\n4.5.1. a rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing number or letters of the Member State which has granted type approval (see item 4.2.1.);\n4.5.2. the base approval number (see item 4.2.2., first half-sentence);\n4.5.3. if necessary, the required arrow, in so far as it relates to the lamp assembly as a whole.\n4.6. This mark may be located anywhere on the lamps which are grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated, provided that:\n4.6.1. it is visible after the installation of the lamps;\n4.6.2. no light-transmitting components of the grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated lamps can be removed without simultaneously removing the approval mark.\n4.7. The identification symbol for each lamp corresponding to each Directive pursuant to which EC component type approval was granted, together with the sequence number (see item 4.2.2, second half-sentence) and, where necessary, the letter \"D\" and the required arrow shall be marked:\n4.7.1. either on the appropriate light-emitting surface;\n4.7.2. or in a group, in such a way that each of the grouped, combined or reciprocally incorporated lamps may be clearly identified.\n4.8. The dimensions of the components of this mark must not be less than the minimum dimensions specified for individual marks by the various Directives pursuant to which EC component type approval was granted.\n5. MODIFICATIONS OF THE TYPE AND AMENDMENTS TO APPROVALS\n5.1. In the case of modifications of the type approved pursuant to this Directive, the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 70/156/EEC shall apply.\n6. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION\n6.1. As a general rule, measures to ensure the conformity of production shall be taken in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC.\n6.2. Every parking lamp shall comply with the conditions specified in this Directive. Nevertheless, in the case of a parking lamp selected at random from series production, the requirements as to minimum intensity of the light emitted (measured with a standard filament lamp as referred to in paragraph 8(1)) shall be limited in each relevant direction to 80 % of the minimum values specified in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2(2). Under the same conditions, the prescribed maximum values may be exceeded by 20 %.\n(1) Of the documents referred to in point 1 of Annex II to this Directive.\n(2) Of the documents referred to in point 1 of Annex II to this Directive.\nAppendix 1\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.003902.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.004001.EPS\">\nAppendix 2\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.004102.EPS\">\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.004201.EPS\">\nAppendix 3\nEXAMPLE OF THE EC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK\n>PIC FILE= \"L_1999097EN.004302.EPS\">\nThe device bearing the EC component type-approval mark shown above is a parking lamp, type approved in Germany (e1) pursuant to this Directive (00) under the base approval number 1471.\nANNEX II\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.
