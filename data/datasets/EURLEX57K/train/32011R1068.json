The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) as a feed additive for chickens reared for laying, turkeys for breeding purposes, turkeys reared for breeding, other minor avian species (other than ducks for fattening) and ornamental birds, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10\u00a0years for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening and weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 271/2009\u00a0(2).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) for chickens reared for laying, turkeys for breeding purposes, turkeys reared for breeding, other minor avian species (other than ducks for fattening) and ornamental birds. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 11 May 2011\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) for chickens reared for laying, turkeys for breeding purposes, turkeys reared for breeding, other minor avian species (other than ducks for fattening) and ornamental birds does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that the use of that preparation can improve the zootechnical performances of the target species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (DSM 18404) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a091, 3.4.2009, p.\u00a05.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011;9(5):2172.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
