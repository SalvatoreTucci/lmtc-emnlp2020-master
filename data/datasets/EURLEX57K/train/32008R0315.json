It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin and in certain specific cases to exports thereof.\n(2) Point 4 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of rapid tests approved for the monitoring of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.\n(3) On 30 August 2007, a laboratory informed the Commission that it will cease marketing the approved rapid test for the monitoring of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It is therefore appropriate to delete that test (Institut Pourquier Speed\u2019it BSE) from the list of rapid tests for the monitoring of BSE in bovine animals in Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, point 4 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.

Producers must provide the CRL with the test protocols.\nChanges to rapid tests and to test protocols may only be made after prior notification to the CRL and provided that the CRL finds that the change does not alter the sensitivity, specificity or reliability of the rapid test. That finding shall be communicated to the Commission and to the national reference laboratories.\u2019"}
