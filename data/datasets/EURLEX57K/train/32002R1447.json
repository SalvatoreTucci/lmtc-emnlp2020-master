The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.\n(4) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.\n(5) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(3), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.\n(6) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(5).\n(7) Rapid two-way communication must be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(8) As Council Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2511/2000(6) laying down the detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 should be repealed.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
