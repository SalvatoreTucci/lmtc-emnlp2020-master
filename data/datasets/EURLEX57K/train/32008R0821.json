This Decision provides for the opening of a new annual tariff quota for bananas originating in Mexico.\n(3) In order to implement this tariff quota Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 should be adjusted. For that purpose it is necessary to open a new tariff quota for bananas originating in Mexico and to close the tariff quota for bananas opened in 2004 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1553/2004\u00a0(4) which ceased to apply from 1 January 2006 in consequence of the introduction of the tariff-only regime by Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 of 29 November 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas\u00a0(5).\n(4) In accordance with Decision No 2/2008 the new tariff quota should be open from 1\u00a0January to 31\u00a0December of each calendar year. This quota should apply for the first time from the third day after the publication of Decision No 2/2008 in the Official Journal of the European Union.
