From that date, Mayotte ceased to be an overseas country or territory and became an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(2) The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an agreement with the Republic of the Seychelles relating to the access, for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Republic of Seychelles, to waters and marine biological resources of the Union in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of Mayotte.\n(3) The Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union ('Agreement') was signed in accordance with Council Decision 2014/331/EU\u00a0(2) and is provisionally applied from 20 May 2014.\n(4) The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee responsible for monitoring its application. Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreement, the Joint Committee may approve certain modifications to the Agreement. In order to facilitate the approval of such modifications, it is appropriate to empower the Commission, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.\n(5) In order for the authorities in Mayotte to implement the rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the date on which Mayotte becomes an outermost region, it is necessary to set up the appropriate administrative framework, control activities and physical infrastructure, and to provide the appropriate capacity building. This will be of assistance with regard to the requirement to comply with the international reporting obligations of the Union.\n(6) The necessary financial means should be provided to the fisheries authorities in Mayotte through the use of the shipowners' fees to be paid directly to Mayotte. Such a solution is even more appropriate in view of the strong relationship that has developed between the Seychelles fleet and the local community of the French outermost region of Mayotte. The fishing fleet flagged in the Seychelles has been operating in the Mayotte waters for several years through an arrangement between Mayotte and the vessel shipowners, whereby the shipowners pay a licence fee to Mayotte to fish in its waters. In order to maintain the continuity of fishing operations and subsequent benefits to Mayotte, it is appropriate that all payments related to authorisations and catches under this agreement benefit directly the local community in Mayotte.\n(7) The Agreement should be approved,", "main_body": ["The Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of the Seychelles on access for fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles to waters and marine biological resources of Mayotte, under the jurisdiction of the European Union is hereby approved on behalf of the Union\u00a0(3).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0France shall be authorised to collect, for the account of its outermost region Mayotte, the payments related to authorisations and catches and other fees due by operators of fishing vessels flying the flag of the Seychelles in consideration of the granting of access to waters and marine biological resources within Union waters off the coast of Mayotte in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III, Section 1, paragraphs 8 and 9 and Section 2 of the Annex of the Agreement.
