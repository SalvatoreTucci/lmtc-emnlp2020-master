In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part\u00a0(4), provides in Article 71(5) that, as from 1 February 2003, a tariff quota of 1\u00a0000 tonnes of beef and veal shall be opened and shall be increased annually by 100 tonnes.\n(3) The quotas concerned should be managed through the use of import licences. To this end, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(5), Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector\u00a0(7) are applicable subject to certain derogations.\n(4) Chile has undertaken to issue certificates of authenticity for the products in question attesting that the goods originate in Chile. The specimen and the rules for the use of the certificate of authenticity need to be laid down.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 810/2008 of 11 August 2008 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for high-quality fresh, chilled and frozen beef and for frozen buffalo meat\u00a0(8) provides for certificates of authenticity for periods of 12 months starting on 1 July of one year for a number of beef quotas and veal quotas. To ensure that all imports are managed in a uniform manner, similar implementing rules should be laid down for the quotas for beef and veal originating in Chile.\n(6) In order to ensure proper management of imports of the products concerned, import licences should be issued subject to verification, in particular of the entries on the certificates of authenticity.\n(7) The reimbursement in full of import duty as a result of the exemption from the duty that is applicable from 1 February 2003 is applied in accordance with Article 236 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(9), and with Articles 878 and following of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(10).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Under the tariff quota provided for by Article 71(5) of the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, the products originating in Chile referred to in Annex I to this Regulation may be imported, exempt from the customs duty laid down in the common customs tariff, during the periods from 1 July in one year to 30 June in the following year, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.\nThe quantity of the products referred to in the first paragraph shall be as indicated in Annex I for each import period.", "Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 and Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The import licences shall give rise to an obligation to import from the specified country.
