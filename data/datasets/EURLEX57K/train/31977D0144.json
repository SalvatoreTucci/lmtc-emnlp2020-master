The information recorded in accordance with the characteristics referred to in Article 2 of Directive 76/625/EEC is to be delivered to the SOEC in the following form by those Member States which process their survey information electronically:    1. On nine-track magnetic tape 1600 BPI (630 bytes/cm) IBM standard label or no label or 80-column punch cards coded in EBCDIC.\n2. The information shall refer to summaries of holdings if the survey is exhaustive (or to raised summaries of holdings if the survey is based on random sampling), and not to individual holdings.\n3. The information shall be of fixed record length and shall be recorded in the following FORTRAN format:     I1,I2, I1, I3, I1, 10F7.0 (beginning in position 1 - see Annex III).\n4. The first five fields of each record shall contain information to permit identification (country, production area, species, variety and density class). The codes for these fields are specified in the detailed provisions and in Annex II. The 10 following fields, each of seven digits, shall contain the information about the area in ares within each of the 10 age classes of the record. The age classes are defined in the detailed provisions. The information shall be entered right justified in each field.\n5. In the case of punch cards, each card carries one record (from column 1) ; the rest of the card is to be left blank.\n6. In the case of magnetic tape, Member States shall have a choice as to blocking factor ; the SOEC must be informed as to what blocking factor has been used.\n7. Member States shall specify on the documents accompanying the transmission, the number of species and the number of varieties within each species.\n8. The records shall be sorted according to species, variety, area or territory and density of plantation (where the left to right order of names indicates major to minor sorting).\nII.  The following pages give for the various items of a record:     (a) the codes which are to be used;\n(b) the number of digits required for the item in question;\n(c) the consecutive numbering of the positions for the various items.\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010494\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010495\">\nANNEX II\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010496\"\"PIC FILE= \"T0010497\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010498\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010499\">\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010500\">\nANNEX IV\n>PIC FILE= \"T0010501\">"}
