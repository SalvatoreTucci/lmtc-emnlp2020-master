That Article provides for a general scheme to manage entries into the fleet as well as exits from the fleet.\n(2) Article 2(5) of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 fixes the period of validity of the derogation from the entry/exit scheme for fishing vessels having received public aid for renewal. That period was originally set at 31 December 2007 and was than extended until 31 December 2008 following the political agreement reached in the Council on 19 June 2006 concerning the European Fisheries Fund.\n(3) The Commission act allowing the Member States concerned to grant State aid was adopted later than foreseen. Given the fact that the interested shipyards have a limited capacity, a full implementation of the political agreement reached in the Council on 19 June 2006 becomes impossible within the deadline of 31 December 2008.\n(4) It is, therefore, appropriate to extend the deadline to 2011 for the derogation set out in Article 2(5) of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
