But for some of those substances it is not possible to complete the decision making by 31 December 2008. To allow the programme of work to be concluded it is therefore necessary to extend the time period provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 and Decision 2003/565/EC with respect to the third and the fourth stages of the programme of work. Furthermore, as regards substances which are being included, Member States and interested parties need to be given an adequate period to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.\n(4) This extension of time does not prejudge the possibility of including individual active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC as provided for in the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) of that Directive.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 and Decision 2003/565/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 to Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "In Article 1 to Decision 2003/565/EC, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 August 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
