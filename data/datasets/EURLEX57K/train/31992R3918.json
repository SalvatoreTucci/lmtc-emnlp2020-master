whereas, pending the entry into force of these Agreements,  the Community has concluded Interim Agreements (1) (2) (3) on trade and trade-related measures with  those countries, also signed on 16 December 1991 and implemented on 1 March 1992;\nWhereas Articles 3 and 14 of the Interim Agreements stipulate that certain products originating in  the countries in question may attract a reduced or zero rate of duty on import into the Community,  within the limits of tariff quotas or ceilings; whereas, pursuant to the provisions annexed to  those Agreements, the volumes of the tariff quotas and ceilings, established when the Europe  Agreements were signed, must be increased, from the date on which the Interim Agreements enter into  force, by a percentage specific to each country and category of products;\nWhereas, further, for imports of some processed agricultural products not covered by Annex II to  the Treaty, Article 13 and Protocol N\u00b0 3 of each of these Interim Agreements provide for the fixing  of reduced variable components in accordance with each Protocol of the Agreements in question,  within the limits of the quotas set or established in accordance with the Protocols concerned;  whereas such Protocols provide for an annual increment of the volume of the quotas during the first  five years of application;\nWhereas it seems advisable, in the interests of clarity, to divide the products subject to tariff  ceilings and quotas into two groups, in Annexes I and II to this Regulation, one for industrial  products and one for agricultural products, specifying for each product the volume of its quota or  ceiling and the rate of customs duty applicable; whereas Annexes III, IV and V to this Regulation,  with their pertinent provisions, should group the processed agricultural products attracting a  reduced variable component and originating, respectively, in Hungary, Poland and the territory of  the former CSFR;\nWhereas the decision for the opening of Community quotas should be taken by the Community, in the  execution of its international obligations, in the case of the products listed in Annexes I, II,  III, IV and V to this Regulation; whereas particular care should be taken to ensure that all  Community importers have equal and continuous access to those quotas and that the rates laid down  for the quotas are applied to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until  the quotas are exhausted; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these  quotas, there is no obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the  necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of  administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and close  cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able  to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\nWhereas, in the case of the products listed in Annexes I and II to this Regulation which are  subject to Community tariff ceilings, Community surveillance may be achieved by means of an  administrative procedure based on charging imports of the products in question against the ceilings  at Community level as and when those products are entered with the customs authorities for free  circulation;\nWhereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly rapid cooperation between the  Member States and the Commission, and the latter must in particular be able to monitor quantities  charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to  be particularly close, since the Commission must be able to take appropriate measures to  reintroduce customs duties once a ceiling is reached;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within, and jointly represented by, the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of these tariff measures may be carried out by any one of its  members,", "main_body": ["From 1 January to 31 December 1993 goods originating in Hungary,  Poland and the territory of the former CSFR which are listed in Annexes I and II to this Regulation  shall be subject to Community tariff quotas or ceilings, according to the provisions contained  within the said Annexes.", "From 1 January to 31 December 1993 goods originating in Hungary, Poland and the  territory of the former CSFR listed in Annexes III, IV and V to this Regulation shall be subject to  a reduced variable component determined in accordance with Article 3, within the limits of the  quotas and under the conditions set out in those Annexes.", "The reduced variable components applicable from 1 January to 31 December 1993 shall be  calculated as follows:\n(a) the difference established in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 3033/80 of  11 November 1980 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the  processing of agricultural products (1), between the average threshold price and the average cif  price or free-at-frontier price for each basic product shall be reduced by 20 %;

If a Member State does not use the quantites drawn, it shall return them to the corresponding  quota volume as soon as possible.\n4.  If the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota volume, the  balance shall be allocated on a pro rata basis.

As soon as the ceilings have been reached, the Commission may adopt a regulation reintroducing  the customs duties applicable to the third countries in question until the end of the calendar  year.\nWhen the adoption of such a regulation is requested by a Member State, the Commission shall examine  the request within the following five days and shall inform the requesting Member State of the  action it considers it should take as a result of the request, in the light, in particular, of the  statements sent as provided for in paragraph 2.", "If the Joint Committees established by the Interim Agreements between the European  Economic Community and, respectively, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary and the CSFR  or the Association Councils established by the Association Agreements between these parties, decide  to supplement the Annexes to Protocol N\u00b0 3 to the said Agreements, the Commission shall adjust the  corresponding Annexes to this Regulation as a result.", "The Protocol on the definition of the concept of originating products and methods of  administrative cooperation, annexed to the Interim Agreements between the European Economic  Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, on the  one hand, and Poland, Hungary and the CSFR, on the other hand, shall apply", "In order to ensure compliance with this Regulation, the Commission shall take all  appropriate measures, in close cooperation with the Member States.", "0\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 December 1992.\nFor the Council The President D.
