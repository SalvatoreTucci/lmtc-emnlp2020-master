whereas, in view of these requirements, provision should be made for goods purchased by the person awarded a food-aid supply contract to be paid for at the buying-in price determined pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76;\nWhereas, in order that the conditions of competition existing when tenders are submitted for the award of the food-aid supply contract are not altered subsequent to the award of the contract, a derogation from the application of certain procedures for adjusting the prices on the basis of the date of conclusion of the purchase contract or the date of removal of the goods should be introduced;\nWhereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87 of 8 July 1987 laying down general rules for the mobilization in the Community of products to be supplied as Community food aid\u00a0(5) makes provision for the successful tenderer to deliver, with a view to a food-aid supply contract, rather than goods from public stocks or, where appropriate, manufactured therefrom, goods mobilized on the market or manufactured therefrom provided that he purchases the goods mentioned in the notice of invitation to tender; whereas compliance with this latter obligation is essential on the one hand to meet the objective of contributing towards reducing public stocks and on the other hand to ensure the equality of operators in the award of the supply contract; whereas provision should therefore be made for the lodging by the successful tenderer of a specific security to ensure compliance with the obligation to pay the purchase price to the intervention agency concerned within a short time; whereas, consequently, with a view to that objective, provision should be made for failure to lodge a purchase application with the intervention agency under the conditions laid down to result in the loss of the security relating to the supply of the food aid, lodged pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87;

whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 569/88 of 16 February 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2322/91\u00a0(9), should accordingly not apply;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["With a view to a given food-aid supply contract within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1424/76, rice held by an intervention agency shall be purchased in accordance with this Regulation.\nThe provisions of Articles 2 to 7, adopted for the purpose of the supply of Community food aid pursuant to Article 5 and 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3972/86\u00a0(10) shall apply mutatis mutandis for the supply of the national food aid referred to in the first subparagraph subject to specific national measures on the organization and allocation of the latter.", "With a view to the supply contract referred to in Article 1, the intervention agency shall make available goods meeting the characteristics laid down in the notice of open or restricted invitation to tender.\nThe intervention agency shall take the necessary steps so that all operators interested in submitting a tender for the supply contract may, on publication of the notice of invitation to tender or on receipt of the latter, examine at his own expense samples collected from the product to be mobilized.
