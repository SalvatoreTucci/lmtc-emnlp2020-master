This Directive is a specific directive forming a part of the  comprehensive directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 89/107/EEC.\n2. For the purposes of this Directive, 'colours' are substances which add or restore colour in a  food, and include natural constituents of foodstuffs and natural sources which are normally not  consumed as foodstuffs as such and not normally used as characteristic ingredients of food.\nPreparations obtained from foodstuffs and other natural source materials obtained by physical  and/or chemical extraction resulting in a selective extraction of the pigments relative to the  nutritive or aromatic constituents are colours within the meaning of this Directive.\n3. However, the following substances shall not be considered colours for the purposes of this  Directive:\n- foodstuffs, whether dried or in concentrated form and flavourings incorporated during the  manufacturing of compound foodstuffs, because of their aromatic, sapid or nutritive properties  together with a secondary colouring effect, such as paprika, turmeric and saffron,\n- colours used for the colouring of the inedible external parts of foodstuffs, such as cheese  coatings and sausage casings.", "1. Only the substances listed in Annex I may be used as colours in foodstuffs.\n2. Colours may be used only in the foodstuffs listed in Annexes III, IV and V and under the  conditions specified therein; colours may be used in those same foodstuffs when they are intended  for particular uses in accordance with Directive 89/398/EEC (1).\n3. Colours may not be used in the foodstuffs listed in Annex II except where specifically provided  for in Annex III, IV or V.\n4. Colours permitted for certain uses only are listed in Annex IV.\n5. Colours permitted in general in foodstuffs and the conditions of use therefor are listed in  Annex V.\n6. The maximum levels indicated in the Annexes:\n- relate to ready-to-eat foodstuffs prepared according to the instructions for use,\n- refer to the quantities of colouring principle contained in the colouring preparation.\n7. In the Annexes to this Directive 'quantum satis' means that no maximum level is specified.  However, colouring matters shall be used according to good manufacturing practice at a level not  higher than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose and provided that they do not mislead the  consumer.\n8. For the purpose of health marking as provided in Directive 91/497/EEC and other marking required  on meat products, only E 155 Brown HT, E 133 Brilliant Blue FCF or E 129 Allura Red AC or an  appropriate mixture of E 133 Brilliant Blue FCF and E 129 Allura Red AC may be used.\n9.

Within the meaning of this Directive 'unprocessed' means not having undergone any treatment  resulting in a substantial change in the original state of the foodstuffs. However, they may have  been for example divided, parted, servered, boned, minced, skinned, pared, peeled, ground, cut,  cleaned, trimmed, deep-frozen, frozen, chilled, milled or husked, packed or unpacked.", "Without prejudice to other Community provisions, the presence of a colour in a  foodstuff is permissible:\n- in a compound foodstuff other than one mentioned in Annex II to the extent that the colour is  permitted in one of the ingredients of the compound foodstuff,\nor\n- if the foodstuff is destined to be used solely in the preparation of a compound foodstuff and  to such an extent that the compound foodstuff conforms to the provisions of this Directive.", "It may be decided by the procedure laid down in Article 5, whether a particular  foodstuff belongs to a category of foods mentioned in the Annexes, and whether substances are  colours in the meaning of Article 1.", "1.
