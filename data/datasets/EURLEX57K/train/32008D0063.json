consulting the European Union Eco-labelling Board,\nWhereas:\n(1) Commission Decision 2002/231/EC of 18 March 2002 establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to footwear and amending Decision 1999/179/EC\u00a0(2) expires on 31 March 2008.\n(2) Commission Decision 2002/255/EC of 25 March 2002 establishing ecological criteria for the award of the Community

is appropriate to prolong the period of validity of the ecological criteria and the requirements for Decision 2002/255/EC and Decision 2002/371/EC for a period of 12 months, Decision 2003/287/EC for a period of 18 months, and Decision 2002/231/EC, Decision 2002/272/EC and Decision 2003/200/EC for a period of 24 months.\n(9) Since the review obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000
