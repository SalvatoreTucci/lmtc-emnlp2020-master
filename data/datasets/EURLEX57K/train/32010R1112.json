To avoid any disruption to the economic balance already established and to ensure that fresh milk produced locally can be processed into high value added products, the obligation to incorporate a minimum rate should be abolished.\n(2) Having regard to the amendment to Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 by Regulation (EU) No 641/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), which abolished, with effect from 1 January 2010, the Commission\u2019s obligation to determine an incorporation rate for fresh milk produced locally, Article 46a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 793/2006\u00a0(4) should also be repealed from that date.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Article 46a of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 42, 14.2.2006, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 123, 19.5.2009, p. 62.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 24.7.2010, p. 23.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 145, 31.5.2006, p. 1."}
