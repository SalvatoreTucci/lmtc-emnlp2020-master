The complaint, which was subsequently completed and updated, contained evidence of dumping and material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of microwave ovens corresponding to CN code 8516 50 00 and originating in Japan, the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Korea and commenced an investigation.\n(2) The Commission commenced the investigation by seeking from the parties involved, and verifying, the information necessary for the assessment of dumping and injury.\n(3) On 26 September 1988 the Commission was informed by the complainant that it was withdrawing the complaint because of profound changes in the market place.\n(4) In these circumstances, the Commission has no reason to consider that termination of the proceeding would not be in the interests of the Community.", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of microwave ovens originating in Japan, the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Korea is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 December 1988.\nFor the Commission\nWilly DE CLERCQ\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No C 325, 18. 12. 1986, p. 5."}
