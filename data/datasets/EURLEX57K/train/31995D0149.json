Purpose and area of application This method describes a reference procedure for identifying the nitrogen concentration of volatile  nitrogenous bases (Total-Volatile-Base-N: TVB-N) in fish and fish products. This procedure is  applicable to TVB-N concentrations from 5 mg/100 g to at least 100 mg/100 g.\n2.  Definition The TVB-N concentration is here understood to mean the nitrogen content of volatile nitrogenous  bases determined by the procedure described. The concentration is stated in terms of mg/100 g.\n3.  Brief description The volatile nitrogenous bases are extracted from a sample by a solution of 0,6 M perchloric acid.  After alkalinization the extract is submitted to steam distillation and the volatile base  components are absorbed by an acid receiver. The TVB-N concentration is determined by titration of  the absorbed bases.\n4.  Chemicals Unless otherwise indicated, reagent-grade chemicals should be used. The water used must be either  distilled or demineralized and of at least the same purity. Unless indicated otherwise, a  'solution` is to be understood as an aqueous solution.\n4.1.  Perchloric acid solution = 6 g/100 ml.\n4.2.  Sodium hydroxide solution = 20 g/100 ml.\n4.3.  Hydrochloric acid standard solution 0,05 mol/l (0,05 N).\nNote:  When using an automatic distillation apparatus, titration should take place with a  hydrochloric acid standard solution 0,01 mol/l (0,01 N).\n4.4.  Boric acid solution = 3 g/100 ml.\n4.5.  Silicone anti-foaming agent.\n4.6.  Phenolphtalein solution = 1 g/100 ml 95  % ethanol.\n4.7.  Indicator solution (Tashiro Mixed Indicator) 2 g Methyl - red and 1 g Methylene - blue are dissolved in 1  000 ml 95  % ethanol.\n5.  Instruments and accessories 5.1.  A meat grinder to produce a sufficiently homogenous fish mince.\n5.2.  High-speed blender with revolutions between 8  000 min P1 and 45  000 min P1.\n5.3.  Fluted filter, diameter 150 mm, quick-filtering.\n5.4.  Burette, 5 ml, graduated to 0,01 ml.\n5.5.  Apparatus for steam distillation The apparatus must be able to regulate various amounts of steam and produce a constant amount of  steam over a given period of time. It must ensure that during the addition of alkalizing substances  the resulting free bases cannot escape.\n6.  Execution Warning: When working with perchloric acid, which is strongly corrosive, necessary caution and  preventive measures should be taken.\nThe samples should, if at all possible, be prepared according to paragraph 6.1 as soon as possible  after their arrival.\n6.1.  Preparation of the sample The sample to be analysed should be ground carefully by a meat grinder as described in secton 5.1.  Exactly 10 g +/ P 0,1 g of the ground sample are weighed in a suitable container, mixed with 90,0  ml perchloric acid solution as stated in section 4.1, homogenized for two minutes with a blender as  described in section 5.2, and then filtered.\nThe extract thereby obtained can be kept for at least seven days at a temperature between  approximately 2  \u00b0C and 6  \u00b0C.\n6.2.  Steam distillation 50,0 ml of the extract obtained according to section 6.1 are put in an apparatus for steam  distillation as described in secton 5.5. For a later check on sufficient alkalinization of the  extract, several drops of phenolphtalein as specified in section 4.6 are added. After adding a few  drops silicone anti foaming agent, 6,5 ml of sodium hydroxide solution as specified in section 4.2  are added to the extract, and steam distillation begins immediately.\nThe steam distillation is regulated so that around 100 ml of distillate are produced within 10  minutes. The distillation outflow tube is submerged in a receiver with 100 ml boric acid solution  as specified in section 4.4, to which three to five drops of the indicator solution as described in  4.7 have been added. After exactly 10 minutes the distillation is ended. The distillation outflow  tube is removed from the receiver and washed out with water. The volatile bases contained in the  receiver solution are determined by titration with standard hydrochloric solution as specified in  secton 4.3.\nThe pH of the end point should be 5,0 +/ P 0,1.\n6.3.  Titration Duplicate analyses are required. The applied method is correct if the difference of the duplicates  is not higher than 2 mg/100 g.\n6.4.  Blank A blind test carried out as described in section 6.2.\nInstead of the extract, 50,0 ml perchloric acid solution as specified in section 4.1 are used.\n7.  Calculation of TVB-N By titration of the receiver solution with hydrochloric acid as in 4.3, the TVB-N concentration is  calculated with the following equation:\nTVB-N (expressed in mg/100 g sample) = (V1 PV0) \u00d7 0,14 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 100 M V1 =  Volume of 0,01 M hydrochloric acid solution in ml for sample;\nV0 =  Volume of 0,01 M hydrochloric acid solution in ml for blanc;\nM =  Weight of sample in g.\nRemarks 1.  Duplicate analyses are required. The applied method is correct if the difference between  duplicates is not higher than 2 mg/100 g.\n2.  Check the equipment by distilling solutions of NH4Cl equivalent to 50 mg TVB-/100 g.\n3.  Standard deviation of reproducibility Sr = 1,20 mg/100 g.\nStandard deviation of comparability SR = 2,50mg/100 g.\nANNEX III\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\nSteam generator Distillation tube Steam injection tube Sample extract Cooler Cool water End of condenser Flask or beaker (Boric acid) TVB-N steam distillation apparatus >END OF GRAPHIC>"}
