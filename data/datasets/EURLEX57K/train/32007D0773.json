It necessitates the increased use of testing reactors for medical purposes.\n(2) On 19 February 2004, the Council adopted a Decision concerning the adoption of a supplementary research programme to be implemented by the Joint Research Centre for the European Atomic Energy Community\u00a0(1). That programme was adopted for a period of three years, until 1 January 2007.\n(3) Within the framework of the European Research Area, the supplementary research programme involving the high flux reactor at Petten (the HFR) is one of the principal means available in the Union to contribute to the support and testing of medical diagnostic and therapeutic methods, to the development of materials sciences and to problem-solving in the field of nuclear energy.\n(4) The HFR is in operable condition until at least 2015, and a new operating licence was granted to the reactor operator in February 2005. The supplementary research programme should therefore be extended for a further year to make use of the technical facilities available. The extension should take effect retroactively, to cover the ongoing activities of the programme in the period from 1 January 2007.\n(5) The financial contributions necessary for this extension of the supplementary research programme will be provided by the Netherlands and France,", "main_body": ["The supplementary research programme on the operation of the HFR (the Programme), the objectives of which are set out in Annex I, shall be extended for a period of one year, with effect from 1 January 2007.", "The financial contributions estimated for the execution of the extension of the Programme shall amount to EUR 8\u00a0500\u00a0000.

The safe and reliable operation of the high flux reactor at Petten (the HFR); this activity involves the normal use of the installation for more than 250 days a year and the management of the fuel cycle under the relevant safety and quality controls.\n2. The rational use of the HFR will be developed in a broad range of disciplines. The major research and development themes involving the use of the HFR include: the improvement of safety of existing nuclear reactors; health, including the development of medical isotopes to answer the questions of medical research, and the testing of medical therapeutic techniques; fusion; fundamental research and training; and, waste management, including the possibility of developing nuclear fuels through the elimination of weapons-grade plutonium.\nANNEX II\nBREAKDOWN OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2\nThe contributions to the Programme will come from the Netherlands and France.\nThe breakdown of these contributions is as follows:\nThe Netherlands : EUR 8\u00a0200\u00a0000\nFrance : EUR 300\u00a0000\nTotal : EUR 8\u00a0500\u00a0000"}
