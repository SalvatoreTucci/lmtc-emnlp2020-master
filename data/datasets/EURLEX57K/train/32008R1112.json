Moreover the constraints imposed by the Regulation as regards the fulfilment of export formalities complicate the tasks of customs authorities in those Member States where electronic customs systems are already applied.\n(3) To make the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006 easier, the conditions relating to the presentation of the meat to the customs authorities and the export formalities therein should thus be simplified whilst ensuring the effectiveness and transparency of the control by the customs authorities.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006 should therefore be amended.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
