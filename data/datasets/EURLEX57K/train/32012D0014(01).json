The criteria determining the eligibility of collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem monetary policy operations are laid down in Annex I to the Guideline ECB/2011/14.\n(2) Pursuant to Section 1.6 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Governing Council may, at any time, change the instruments, conditions, criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations.
