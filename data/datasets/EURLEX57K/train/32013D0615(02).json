Article 51 of that Regulation provides that the Commission may organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States responsible for the official controls referred to in that Regulation, which may be opened to participants from third countries, in particular developing countries. Those courses may include in particular training on Community feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare rules.\n(2) Article 2(1)(i) of Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community provides the legal instrument for organising courses in the field of plant health.\n(3) The \u2018Better training for safer food\u2019 programme has been established by the Commission in order to achieve the aims set out in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. The Commission Communication of 20 September 2006 on \u2018Better training for safer food\u2019\u00a0(6) explores options for future organisation of training.\n(4) The 2013 work programme on training in the field of food and feed safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health for the implementation of \u2018Better training for safer food\u2019 programme in Member States should therefore be adopted.\n(5) Commission Decision 2008/544/EC\u00a0(7) of 20 June 2008 transformed the \u2018Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme\u2019 into the \u2018Executive Agency for Health and Consumers\u2019 (hereafter \u2018the Agency\u2019).

Those rules are also to specify the circumstances in which creditors paid late are entitled to receive default interest charged to the line from which the principal was paid.\n(10) This Decision should therefore provide rules on the payment of default interest due for late payments related to actions included in the 2013 work programme,", "main_body": ["The work programme for the implementation in 2013 of the \u2018Better training for safer food\u2019 programme as set out in the Annex is hereby adopted.
