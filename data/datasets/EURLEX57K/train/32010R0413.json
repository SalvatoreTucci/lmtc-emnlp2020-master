The amendment of that entry has been adopted by OECD Council Decision C(2008) 156 and still needs to be agreed under the Basel Convention. Pending approval by the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention and amendment of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, it is appropriate to incorporate that clarification in Union legislation.\n(2) In April 2008, at its 11th meeting, WGWPR of OECD agreed to amend the wording of entry AA010 of the OECD Amber list of wastes. The amendment of that entry has been adopted by OECD Council Decision C(2008) 156. It is therefore appropriate to incorporate that amendment in Union legislation.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),", "main_body": ["Annexes III, IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0190, 12.7.2006, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0114, 27.4.2006, p.\u00a09.\nANNEX\nAnnexes III, IV and V are amended as follows:\n1.
