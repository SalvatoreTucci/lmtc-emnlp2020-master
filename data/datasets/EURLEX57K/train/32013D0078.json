Such plan must comply with the risk-based methodology set out in Article 77(1) of and Annex XXI to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.\n(4) Pursuant to Article 61(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, the control authorities of the Member State in which the fisheries products are landed may permit the transport before weighing of those products to registered buyers, registered auctions or other bodies of persons which are responsible for the first marketing of fisheries products in another Member State, provided the Member States concerned have adopted a common control programme approved by the Commission, as referred to in Article 94 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.

The Netherlands have submitted a new sampling plan on 27 September 2012 to replace the plan approved by Implementing Decision 2012/474/EU. Those sampling plans, that control plan and that common control programme are in line with the relevant risk-based methodologies. They should therefore be approved.\n(7) The Commission should be in a position to revoke the approval if it appears that the Member State concerned does not apply or not fully apply the sampling plans, the control plan or the common control programme.\n(8) The Commission will monitor the application of the sampling plans, the control plan and common control programme both with respect to their effective operation as well as to their regular review by the Member State concerned. For that reason Member States should report to the Commission on the application of these plans. If it appears that such a plan or programme does not ensure adequate weighing, the Member State concerned should submit a revised plan or programme to the Commission for approval,", "main_body": ["Approval\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sampling plans submitted respectively on 5 October 2012, 5 April 2012 and 20 April 2012 by Bulgaria, Latvia and Sweden for the purposes of Article 60(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 are approved.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sampling plan submitted on 27 September 2012 by the Netherlands for the weighing of fisheries products on board the fishing vessel, as referred to in Article 60(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, is approved.
