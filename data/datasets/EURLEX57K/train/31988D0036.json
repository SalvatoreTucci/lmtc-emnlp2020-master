whereas since 1986 both seed potatoes and ware potatoes may be produced in Denmark only where they derive from such cleaned and healthy stock material;\nWhereas, moreover, Denmark has set up appropriate production, processing and distribution structures, aimed at preventing reinfections of potatoes produced under the above conditions;\nWhereas the results of intensive official surveys, including testing carried out in accordance with the established Community method for the detection and diagnosis of Corynebacterium sepedonicum, carried out in Denmark on potatoes harvested there in 1986, have so far confirmed that potatoes produced in Denmark at least since 1986 may be deemed to be free from potato ring rot;\nWhereas, nevertheless, precautionary measures should be taken on a temporary basis to consolidate this conclusion, before the situation in Denmark is treated as entirely the same as that in the other Member States, in which potato ring rot is not known to occur; these precautionary measures should complete the control patterns which Denmark has set up under Directive 80/665/EEC in respect of its entire potato production, and they would be without prejudice to the phytosanitary inspections which may be carried out by the introducing Member States under the Community plant health regime;\nWhereas the additional measures adopted by France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom should therefore be made more flexible from the beginning of the 1987/88 production year onwards;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are hereby authorized, for a period expiring on 30 June 1990, to require that, in addition to the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Directive 80/665/EEC, potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) originating in Denmark may enter their territories only where they have been subjected to official testing according to the established Community method for the detection and diagnosis of Corynebacterium sepedonicum, on a sample\nof at least 200 tubers per 25 tonnes maximum, drawn officially per grower from each lot intended for introduction into the relevant Member State, and have been found free, in this testing, of potato ring rot.", "The Member States referred to in Article 1 shall adjust the additional measures which they adopted as regards Denmark with a view to protecting themselves against the introduction of Corynebacterium sepedonicum in such a manner that they comply with the provisions of Article 1.", "This Decision shall be repealed or amended if and when a case of potato ring rot is detected on potatoes originating in Denmark, either under the control patterns set up by Denmark under Directive 80/665/EEC, or in the official tests carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, or on any other occasion.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic, Ireland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 December 1987.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 180, 14. 7. 1980, p. 30."}
