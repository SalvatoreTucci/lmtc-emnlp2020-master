whereas, in many cases, the latter bodies are not able to take over the products by the deadline laid down in the various invitations to tender for them to be made available;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2946/91 of 7 October 1991 on the defraying of certain costs relating to food aid for the people of the Soviet Union (4) lays down the conditions under which the Community is to finance additional storage costs  incurred by such late take-over by the bodies responsible for the carriage of the products to the destination;\nWhereas, owing to the persistence of particular difficulties encountered in the carriage of this emergency aid, provision should be made for the requisite measures to cope with an extension of the period of storage before take-over by the bodies  responsible for carriage; whereas, as far as possible, in order not to hinder in particular the carriage of the aid, those measures must consist in concluding contracts for storage in loco with the undertakings awarded contracts for the manufacture of  the products, against payment of a daily allowance fixed taking into account the various costs arising from the extension of storage and the lodging of a suitable security; whereas, however, in the absence of agreement from those undertakings, provision  should be made for the actual take-over of the products by the intervention agencies and storage under their responsibility;\nWhereas the undertakings awarded contracts for the supply of canned beef should also qualify for the daily allowance to offset the extension of the period of storage where the dates for taking over the goods and making them available have been postponed  owing to stock release difficulties at the German intervention agency in compliance with Article 12a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91 (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2546/91 (6);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are to replace those adopted by abovementioned Regulation (EEC) No 2946/91; whereas the latter should accordingly be repealed;\nWhereas the exchange rate to be used to convert the daily allowance into the national currency should be specified and it should be fixed at a level reflecting the real economic situation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee provided for in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 598/91,", "main_body": ["Where products to be supplied under invitations to tender opened pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 598/91 have not been taken over by the bodies designated by the Commission for their carriage to and distribution at the destination by the  deadline for making them available, the intervention agencies in the Member States in which the products are stored shall ensure that the products are taken over under the terms laid down herein from the day following that deadline.", "The intervention agencies shall conclude storage contracts with the undertakings awarded contracts for the manufacture and packaging of the products who agree to keep the latter in storage until the date of actual take-over by the bodies  responsible for transport or, where appropriate, until a decision is taken by the intervention agency after consulting the Commission to release those undertakings from their obligation to store the products. Those contracts shall stipulate that the  products are to be kept under suitable storage conditions against payment of a daily allowance of ECU 0,27 per tonne per day. That amount shall be converted into national currency using the rate applicable on 16 October 1991 and published in the 'C'  series of the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nSuch contracts shall entail an obligation to lodge a security in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 (7), equal to the supply security provided for in the invitation to tender. The primary requirement within the meaning of Article 20  of the abovementioned Regulation shall be storage of the product under suitable conditions until the end of the storage period as determined in Article 2.", "Where the undertakings awarded contracts are unable to provide storage under the conditions laid down in Article 2, the intervention agencies shall take all measures necessary to take over the products themselves and store them until they are  removed by the bodies responsible for carriage or, where applicable, until a decision is taken by the Commission regarding their disposal.\nThe costs arising from this operation shall be covered by standard allowances fixed pursuant to Article 6 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European  Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (8).", "Expenditure arising from such operations shall be entered in the accounts each month by the intervention agencies of the Member States and shall be shown in the accounts as expenditure on emergency aid to the Soviet Union.", "The following paragraph is hereby added to Article 12a of Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91:\n'7.
