domestic animals of the porcine species.\n(9) Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species are authorised under Decision 90/14/EEC in the light of the situation achieved with regard to animal health in those countries.\n(10) Therefore, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of bovine semen are authorised under conditions set out in Decision 94/577/EC.\n(11) Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine are authorised under Decision 91/270/EEC in the light of the situation

prepared and updated in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 88/407/EEC and are made available to the public at the Commission's web-site. Consequently, the lists of approved collection centres included in Decision 93/693/EC are outdated and therefore obsolete.\n(16) Decision 93/693/EC should be therefore repealed accordingly.\n(17) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 90/14/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "The Annex to Decision 91/270/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "The entries for Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia in the Annex to Decision 92/452/EEC are deleted on the date these acceding States become Member States of the Community.", "Part II of Annex A to Decision 92/471/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Decision.", "Decision 93/693/EC is repealed.", "Part III of the Annex to Decision 94/63/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Decision.", "Part II of Annex A to Decision 94/577/EC is amended in accordance with Annex V to this Decision.", "1.
