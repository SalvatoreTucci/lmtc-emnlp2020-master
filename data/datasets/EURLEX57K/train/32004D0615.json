To detect the prevalence of infections with avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 in different species of poultry by repeating the screening exercise of 2002/2003 in a modified, more targeted manner.\n2. To further contribute to a cost-benefit study in relation to eradication of all H5 and H7 subtypes from poultry envisaged by the change in definition of avian influenza.\n3. To continue surveillance for avian influenza on a voluntary basis in wild birds, in particular by those Member States which have already good cooperation with ornithological organisations or other bodies. The outcome of such surveillance should further provide valuable information for an early warning system of strains that may be introduced into poultry flocks from wild birds.\n4. To contribute to the knowledge on the threats of avian influenza to animal health from wildlife.\n5. To foster the connection and integration of human and veterinary networks for influenza surveillance.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES FOR SURVEYS IN POULTRY\n\u2014 Sampling shall cover the winter period as in many countries a large slaughter of poultry (in particular turkeys and geese) takes place around Christmas.\n\u2014 15 March 2005 shall be the date for the submission of the final survey results.\n\u2014 Testing of samples shall be carried out at national laboratories for avian influenza (NL) in Member States or by other laboratories authorised by the competent authorities and under the control of the NL.\n\u2014 All results (both serological and virological) shall be sent to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for collation. A good flow of information must be ensured. The CRL shall provide technical support and keep an enlarged stock of diagnostic reagents.\n\u2014 All AI virus isolates shall be submitted to the CRL. Viruses of H5/H7 subtype shall be subjected to the standard characterisation tests (nucleotide sequencing/IVPI) according to Council Directive 92/40/EEC.\n\u2014 All positive findings shall be retrospectively investigated at the holding and the conclusions of this investigation shall be reported to the Commission and the CRL.\n\u2014 Specific protocols to accompany the sending of material to the CRL and reporting tables for collection of survey data shall be provided by the CRL. In those tables the laboratory testing methods used shall be indicated.\n\u2014 Blood samples for serological examination shall be collected from all species of poultry, from at least five to 10 birds (except ducks and geese) per holding, and from the different sheds, if more than one shed is present on a holding.\n\u2014 Sampling shall be stratified throughout the whole Member State, so that samples can be considered as representative for the whole Member State, taking into account:\n(a) the number of holdings to be sampled. This number shall be defined so as to ensure the identification of at least one infected holding if the prevalence of infected holdings is at least 5\u00a0%, with a 95\u00a0% confidence interval (see table 1); and\n(b) the number of birds sampled from each holding shall be defined so as to ensure 95\u00a0% probability of identifying at least one positive bird if the prevalence of sero-positive birds is \u2265\u00a030\u00a0%.\n\u2014 The sampling design shall also consider:\n(a) the types of production and their specific risks, such as free range, outdoor keeping, multi age layers, use of surface water, a relatively longer life span, the presence of more than one species on the holding, etc.;\n(b) the number of turkey holdings to be sampled, which shall be defined to ensure the identification of at least one infected holding if the prevalence of infected holdings is at least 5\u00a0%, with a 99\u00a0% confidence interval;\n(c) where holdings producing ratites and quails are present in a Member State they shall be included in the programme;\n(d) the time period; where appropriate, sampling shall be adapted to identified periods, during which the presence of other poultry hosts on a holding might pose a greater risk for disease introduction;\n(e) Member States that must carry out sampling for Newcastle disease to maintain their status as Newcastle disease non-vaccinating countries (Decision 94/327/EC) may utilise these samples from breeding flocks for the surveillance of H5/H7 antibodies.\nTABLE 1\nNumber of holdings to be sampled of each poultry category (except turkey holdings)\nNumber of holdings per poultry category (except turkey holdings) Number of holdings to be sampled\nUp to 34 All\n35-50 35\n51-80 42\n81-250 53\n>\u00a0250 60\nTABLE 2\nNumber of turkey holdings to be sampled\nNumber of turkey holdings Number of holdings to be sampled\nUp to 46 All\n47-60 47\n61-100 59\n101-350 80\n>\u00a0350 90\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DETECTION OF INFECTIONS WITH H5/H7 SUBTYPES OF AVIAN INFLUENZA IN DUCKS AND GEESE\n\u2014 Blood samples for serological testing shall be taken preferably from birds which are kept outside in fields.\n\u2014 From each selected holding 40-50 blood samples shall be taken for serological testing.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA IN WILD BIRDS\nC.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Survey design and implementation\n\u2014 Liaisons with bird conservation/watching institutions and ringing stations are necessary. Sampling will probably be best carried out by staff from these groups/stations. Cooperation with hunters for obtaining samples from birds that are hunted may also be possible.\n\u2014 Experience with the previous surveys has shown that the virus isolation rate was extremely low, therefore sampling should focus on the birds migrating south during autumn and early winter.\nC.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling procedures\n\u2014 Cloacal swabs for virological examination should be taken. In addition to \u201cfirst year\u201d birds in the autumn, host species with high susceptibility and increased contact with poultry (such as mallard ducks) may offer the highest chance of success.\n\u2014 The distribution between the different species should ideally be as follows:\n\u2014 70\u00a0% waterfowl\n\u2014 20\u00a0% shorebirds\n\u2014 10\u00a0% other free-living birds.\n\u2014 Swabs containing faeces, or carefully collected fresh faeces shall be taken from wild birds trapped, hunted and found freshly dead.\n\u2014 Pooling of up to five samples from the same species is possible.\n\u2014 Specific care has to be taken for the storage and transport of samples. If rapid transport within 48 hours to the laboratory (in transport medium at 4\u00a0\u00b0Celsius) is not guaranteed, samples shall be stored and then transported in dry ice at \u2013\u00a070\u00a0\u00b0Celsius.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LABORATORY TESTING\nLaboratory tests should be carried out pursuant to the guideline procedures established in Annex III to Council Directive 92/40/EEC (including examination of sera from ducks and geese by HI). However, if laboratory tests not laid down in the Directive 92/40/EEC, nor described in the OIE Terrestrial Manual, are envisaged, Member States shall provide the necessary validation data to the CRL, in parallel to submitting their programme to the Commission for approval. All positive serological findings shall be confirmed by the National laboratories for avian influenza by an haemagglutination-inhibition test, using designated strains supplied by the Community Reference Laboratory:\n(a) Initial test using Duck/Denmark/64650/03 (H5N7)\n(b) Test all positives with Ostrich/Denmark/72420/96 (H5N2) to eliminate N9 cross reactive antibody.\n(a) Initial test using Turkey/England/647/77 (H7N7)\n(b) Test all positives with African Starling/983/79 (H7N1) to eliminate N7 cross reactive antibody.\u2019"}
