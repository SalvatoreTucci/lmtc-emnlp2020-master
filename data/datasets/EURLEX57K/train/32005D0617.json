In Northern Ireland the proposed system of identification and registration of ovine animals could achieve compliance with most of the objectives laid down in Regulation (EC) No 21/2004, but its implementation would demand a high level of awareness and commitment from all parties involved.\n(3) The competent authority of the United Kingdom has undertaken the commitment to address the concerns raised, and in particular to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 within 10 weeks of the requested approval being granted.\n(4) The systems of identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals in Great Britain and Northern Ireland should therefore be given provisional approval for the interim period allowing the replacement of the second means of identification for ovine animals by that system, except in the case of animals involved in intra-Community trade.\n(5) The competent authority should carry out appropriate checks in order to verify the proper implementation of the systems of identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The systems for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals provided for under Article 4(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 implemented by the United Kingdom in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are hereby considered to be provisionally operational from 9 July 2005 until 30 April 2006 at the latest.", "The Commission shall in cooperation with the authorities of the United Kingdom make inspections on the spot to verify implementation of the action proposed by the United Kingdom.\nThe provisional approval of the system for identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals granted in Article 1 shall be reviewed in the light of the inspection findings by 31 January 2006.", "Without prejudice to provisions to be laid down according to Article 10(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 the competent authority shall carry out the appropriate on-the-spot checks each year to verify compliance by keepers with the requirements on identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 August 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 9.1.2004, p. 8."}
