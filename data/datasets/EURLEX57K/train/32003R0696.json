The Community needs to be able to respond appropriately to such exceptional natural disasters whenever they occur in candidate countries, using various instruments including the pre-accession instrument set up under Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999(4), one of its objectives being to solve priority and specific problems for the sustainable adaptation of the agricultural sector and rural areas in these countries.\n(2) No special provision is included in that Regulation for actions to help restore rural areas following exceptional natural disasters.\n(3) Appropriate action by the Community in the wake of such disasters is needed. These events place inter alia a considerable economic burden on the affected parties both in the public and private sectors and coincide with the preparation for accession. Under a co-financing policy instrument such as that set up under Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999, appropriate action for the relevant projects in the countries concerned should include an increase both in the rate of Community assistance and in the normal ceilings on aid intensities.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 is hereby amended as follows:", "shall be replaced by the following:\n\"Article 8\nRate of Community contribution\n1.
