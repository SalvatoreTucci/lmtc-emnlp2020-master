The possibility of issuing licences for these countries from 1 January 2003 should be reintroduced because the planned date for the introduction of concessions cannot now be met. In order to ensure that the concessions as granted are observed when they enter into force, a derogation to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(4) should be introduced, limiting the licences' term of validity to their month of issue.\n(2) With a view to the entry into force on 1 January 2003 of the new concessions granted to the Czech and Slovak Republics, Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2002 provides that, Article 18(3) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 notwithstanding, no refund is to be paid in respect of licences used on or after 1 January 2003 for exports to the Czech or Slovak Republics that show in box 7 a destination other than either of those two countries. As that date cannot now be met, the Article in question should be repealed.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, the term of validity of the export licences with advance fixing of the refund applied for on or after 1 January 2003 for which the Czech or Slovak Republics are the intended destination shall expire at the end of the month in which they are issued.", "Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2002 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 December 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 48.\n(2) OJ L 79, 22.3.2002, p. 15.\n(3) OJ L 293, 29.10.2002, p. 17.\n(4) OJ L 20, 27.1.1999, p. 8."}
