Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, on which the ACP-EU partnership is based, constitute the essential elements of that Agreement and, consequently, the basis of our relations.\nIn 2004 the European Union took the view that the political situation in Guinea violated these essential elements and in July 2004 it initiated consultations under Article 96 of the Agreement. These consultations gave rise to conclusions of which the Head of Government was informed by an earlier letter, 14 April 2005.\nThe appropriate measures provided for a monitoring period of 36 months which ends on 14 April 2008. During this period, reinforced political dialogue took place, which saw, amongst other things, four joint follow-up missions by the Council and the Commission in May 2005, February 2006, May 2007 and March 2008, and the visit of Commissioner Michel in October 2006. At the end of December 2006, in view of the progress made, the European Union decided to make available to Guinea envelope A of the 9th EDF, representing an amount of EUR 85,8 million.\nThe last follow-up mission was thus able to confirm that the measures carried out by the Guinean authorities are proceeding in a generally positive direction, particularly in terms of the electoral process, strongly backed by the European Union, and in the field of macroeconomic policies. However, the organisation of the parliamentary elections, including fixing a date for them, which is one of the main undertakings given by the Guinean Government, has not yet been finalised. In view of the action currently being taken, these undertakings will likely be fulfilled within 12 months.\nAware of the positive action undertaken in Guinea and of what has still to be done, the European Union has decided to extend the monitoring period for the Decision of 14 April 2005 to 48 months so as to enable the Guinean authorities to fulfil all the undertakings given. This Decision may be reviewed at any time depending on how the situation develops.\nThe appropriate measures of which we informed you in our letter of 14 April 2005 still apply.\nYours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
