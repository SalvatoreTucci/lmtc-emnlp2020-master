Those flavouring substances were assessed by the EFSA in the following flavouring group evaluations: evaluation FGE.06rev4\u00a0(3) (substances FL Nos 02.229, 05.137, 09.562 and 09.854), evaluation FGE.07rev4\u00a0(4) (substances FL Nos 02.145, 02.194, 02.211, 07.198 and 07.204), evaluation FGE.08rev5\u00a0(5) (substance FL No 15.134), evaluation FGE.09rev4\u00a0(6) (substances FL Nos 07.202 and 07.255), evaluation FGE.12rev3\u00a0(7) (substance FL No 05.182), evaluation FGE.20rev4\u00a0(8) (substances FL Nos 05.026, 05.028, 05.029 and 09.858), evaluation in FGE.23rev4\u00a0(9) (substance FL No 13.170), evaluation in FGE.63rev1\u00a0(10) (substances FL Nos 02.252, 07.190 and 09.936), evaluation FGE.94rev1\u00a0(11) (substance FL No 16.095) and evaluation FGE.304\u00a0(12) (substance FL No 16.123). The EFSA concluded that those flavouring substances do not give rise to safety concerns at the estimated levels of dietary intakes.\n(4) Therefore, the flavouring substances assessed in those flavouring group evaluations should be listed as evaluated substances by deleting footnote references 1 to 4 in the relevant entries of the Union list.\n(5) After publication of the Union list, certain errors have been identified in that list.
