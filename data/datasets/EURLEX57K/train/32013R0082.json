In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(4) (\u2018the Agreement\u2019), which was approved on behalf of the Community by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of the Council and of the Commission\u00a0(5), provides for duty-free imports of a quantity of 1\u00a0200 tonnes per annum for meat of bovine animals, boneless, dried, falling under CN code ex\u00a00210\u00a020\u00a090.\n(3) Detailed rules should therefore be laid down on an annual basis for the relevant duty-free import tariff quota.\n(4) To be eligible for the benefit of that tariff quota, the products concerned should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement. A precise definition of the eligible products should be provided. For reasons of control, imports under that quota should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity certifying that the meat corresponds exactly to the eligible definition. It is necessary to establish a model for those certificates and lay down detailed rules for their use.\n(5) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6) and from Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector\u00a0(7).\n(6) In order to ensure the proper management of the imports of the products concerned, provision should be made for import licences to be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Union import tariff quota for dried boneless meat of bovine animals falling within CN code ex\u00a00210\u00a020\u00a090 and originating in Switzerland is opened every year for an annual volume of 1\u00a0200 tonnes for periods from 1 January to 31 December (hereinafter \u2018the quota\u2019).\nThe order number of the quota shall be 09.4202.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be those provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, dried boneless meat shall mean cuts of meat from haunches of bovine animals aged at least 18 months, with no visible intramuscular fat (3 to 7\u00a0%) and a pH of the fresh meat between 5,4 and 6,0, salted, seasoned, pressed, dried only in fresh dry air and developing noble mould (bloom of microscopic fungi).
