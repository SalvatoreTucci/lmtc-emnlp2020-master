To this end, a study of the possibility of a programme financed by the Community was called for.\n(2) Recommendation 6 of the European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium on the prevention and control of organised crime\u00a0(2) calls for the Council to be assisted by suitably qualified experts on crime prevention, such as the national focal points, or by establishing a network of experts from national crime prevention organisations.\n(3) Council Decision 2001/427/JHA established a European Crime Prevention Network\u00a0(3).\n(4) An external evaluation of the European Crime Prevention Network which was conducted in 2008-2009 identified opportunities for strengthening the Network which were accepted by the EUCPN Board and which make it necessary to repeal Decision\u00a02001/427/JHA and to replace it by a new Council Decision concerning the Network.\n(5) The evaluation identified the need for more engagement in the activities of the Network by the national representatives.\n(6) A number of changes are required to strengthen the Network which include amendments to the provisions dealing with contact points, the Secretariat, the structure of the Board and its tasks, including the appointment of the Chair.\n(7) Changes in the composition of the Network should be efficient and cost-effective, drawing on previous experiences of Member States in funding and carrying out the secretarial and other Network tasks. The Board should increase efforts in cooperating to investigate and exploit to their full potential, the possibilities for funding through the general budget of the European Union.
