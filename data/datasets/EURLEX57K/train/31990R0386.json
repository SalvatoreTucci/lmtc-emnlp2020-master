In cases where ordinary visual inspection fails to establish that the goods correspond to the description given in the refunds nomenclature, and where classification or the quality of the goods requires very precise information about the ingredients thereof, the customs authorities shall verify that description according to the nature of the product by using all the senses or by applying physical measures that may go as far as submitting the goods for analysis by laboratories specially equipped for the purpose.\n4.
