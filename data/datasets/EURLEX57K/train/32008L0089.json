The provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 76/756/EEC.\n(2) In order to increase road safety by improving the conspicuity of motor vehicles the obligation for fitting dedicated daytime running lights on these vehicles should be introduced into Directive 76/756/EEC.\n(3) New technologies like the Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS) and the Emergency Stop Signal (ESS) are expected to have a positive influence on road safety. Directive 76/756/EEC should therefore be amended in order to allow the fitting of these devices.\n(4) In order to take into account further amendments to UN/ECE Regulation No 48\u00a0(4) on which the Community has already voted, it is appropriate to adapt Directive 76/756/EEC to technical progress by aligning it to the technical requirements of this UN/ECE Regulation. In the interest of clarity Annex II to Directive 76/756/EEC should be amended.\n(5) Directive 76/756/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Technical Committee \u2014 Motor Vehicles,", "main_body": ["Annex II, paragraph 1 to Directive 76/756/EEC is amended as follows:\n\u20181.
