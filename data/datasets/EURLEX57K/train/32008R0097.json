For the 2007/2008 marketing year, the balance indicated the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1545/2007 of 20 December 2007 fixing the complementary quantity of raw cane-sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries in the period from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008\u00a0(3) fixed a first complementary quantity of 80\u00a0000 tonnes to meet the most urgent supply needs for the first months of the 2007/2008 marketing year. Within the framework of the Economic Partnership Agreements, the additional market access of sugar will be for the 2008/2009 marketing year only. Adequate supply of raw sugar for refining for the refining industry for the 2007/2008 marketing year therefore depends on the availability of complementary quantities. To ensure this supply, it is appropriate to open a supplementary quantity of complementary sugar of 120\u00a0000 tonnes for the marketing year 2007/2008.\n(4) This adequate supply of the refineries can only be guaranteed if the traditional export agreements between the beneficiary countries are respected. Therefore a breakdown between the beneficiary countries or group of countries is needed. For India, a quantity of 4\u00a0000 tonnes is opened. This brings India's complementary quantity for the 2007/2008 marketing year in line with its share of the total complementary quantity of the 2006/2007 marketing year. The remaining quantities should be fixed for the ACP States, which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["In addition to the quantities laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1545/2007, a complementary quantity of 120\u00a0000 tonnes of complementary raw cane sugar in white sugar equivalent is fixed for the marketing year 2007/2008:\n(a) 116\u00a0000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in the States listed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 except India;\n(b) 4\u00a0000 tonnes expressed as white sugar originating in India.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
