However, the CVMP concluded that because of the fact that the depletion of the substance and its residue selenium from an injection site is extremely slow, there is a risk that consumption of an injection site would lead to an intake of selenium greater than the established safe level. Therefore, to ensure that consumers' exposure to selenium is not above the established tolerable upper intake level, the CVMP recommended that barium selenate used in veterinary medicinal products should not be administered by injection.\n(6) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The CVMP recommended the extrapolation of the existing \u2018no MRL required\u2019 status for barium selenate in relation to bovine and ovine species to all food producing species.\n(7) The entry for barium selenate in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with this Regulation.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 17 May 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0152, 16.6.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (OJ L\u00a015, 20.1.2010, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010, the entry for the substance \u2018barium selenate\u2019 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic Classification\n\u2018Barium selenate NOT APPLICABLE All food producing species No MRL required NOT APPLICABLE Not for administration by injection Alimentary tract and metabolism/mineral supplements\u2019"}
