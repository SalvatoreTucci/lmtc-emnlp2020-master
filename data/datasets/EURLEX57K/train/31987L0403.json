In exceptional cases, however, the technical services may ask for a vehicle of the  type concerned to be submitted to it for an actual test.\n4.4.4.When measuring front and rear incidence angles and ramp angles, no account is taken of  underrun protective devices.\n4.5.Definitions and sketches of front and rear incidences angles, ramp angle and ground clearance 4.5.1.'Front incidence angle' means the maximum angle between the ground plane and planes  tangential to the tyres of the front wheels, under a static load, such that no point of the vehicle  ahead of the front axle is situated below these planes and no rigid part of the vehicle, with the  exception of any steps, is situated below these planes.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n1>END OF GRAPHIC>\n4.5.2.'Rear incidence angle' means the maximum angle between  the ground plane and planes tangential to the tyres of the rear wheels, under a static load, such  that no point of the vehicle behind the rearmost axle is situated below these planes and no rigid  part of the vehicle is situated below these planes.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n2>END OF GRAPHIC>\n4.5.3.'Ramp angle' means the minimum acute angle between two  planes, perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle, tangential to the tyres of  the front wheels and to the tyres of the rear wheels respectively, under a static load, the  intersection of which touches the rigid underside of the vehicle apart from the wheels. This angle  defines the steepest ramp over which the vehicle can pass.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n3>END OF GRAPHIC>\n4.5.4.'Ground clearance between the axles' means the shortest  distance between the ground plane and the lowest fixed point of the vehicle.\nMulti-axle bogies are considered to be a single axle.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n4>END OF GRAPHIC>\n-'Ground clearance beneath one axle' means the distance  beneath the highest point of the arc of a circle passing through the centre of the tyre footprint  of the wheels on one axle (the inner wheels in the case of twin tyres) and touching the lowest  fixed point of the vehicle between the wheels. N\u00b0 rigid part of the vehicle may project into the  shaded area of the diagram. Where appropriate, the ground clearance of several axles is indicated  in accordance with their arrangement, for example 280/250/250.\n>START OF GRAPHIC>\n5>END OF GRAPHIC>"}
