The raw material shall be fresh, sound, clean and suitable for processing.\nThe raw material may have been chilled before being used for the manufacture of peaches in syrup.", "1. Peaches in syrup and/or in natural fruit juice must be manufactured in one of the styles defined in paragraph 2.\n2. For the purpose of this Regulation the styles are defined as follows:\n(a) 'whole fruit' means the whole fruit, unpitted;\n(b) 'halves' means the pitted fruit cut vertically into two approximately equal parts;\n(c) 'quarters' means the pitted fruit cut into four approximately equal parts;\n(d) 'slices' means the pitted fruit cut into more than four wedge-shaped parts;\n(e) 'dice' means the pitted fruit cut into cube-like parts.\n3. Each container with peaches in syrup and/or peaches in natural fruit juice shall contain only one style, and the fruit or pieces thereof shall be practically uniform in size. No other type of fruit may be found in the container.\n4. The colour of peaches in syrup shall be characteristic for the type used. Portions which were obviously near or part of the pit cavity and which after canning become slightly discoloured are considered to be of normal characteristic colour.\nContainers with peaches in syrup and/or peaches in natural fruit juice must not contain units having green parts.\n5. Peaches in syrup shall be free of foreign materials of non-vegetable origin and from foreign flavours and odours. The fruit shall be fleshy and may be variable in tenderness but shall be neither excessively soft nor excessively firm.\n6. Peaches in syrup shall be practically free from:\n(a) foreign materials of vegetable origin;\n(b) peel;\n(c) blemished units.\nWhole fruits, halves and quarters shall also be practically free from mechanically damaged units.", "1. Fruit, or pieces thereof, shall be considered practically uniform in size when, in a container, the weight of the largest unit is not more than twice the weight of the smallest unit.\nIf there are less than 20 units in a containers, one unit may be disregarded. When determining the largest and the smallest units, broken units shall not be taken into consideration.\n2. For the purposes of Article 3 (4), the following colours shall be considered normal for a type:\n- yellow, including varietal types in which the predominant colour ranges from pale yellow to rich red orange,\n- white, including varietal types in which the predominant colour ranges from white to yellow-white.\n3.

Halves which are not cut vertically shall also be considered as mechanically damaged;\n(d) 'peel' means both peel adhering to peach flesh and peel found loose in the container;\n(e) 'foreign material of vegetable origin' means vegetable materials which are irrelevant to the fruit itself or which have been attached to the fresh fruit but should have been removed during processing, in particular stalks and leaves and pieces thereof.
