The appropriate provisions should therefore be adopted.\n(2) Article 9(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90 provides for the possibility of curtailing the storage period in the case of exports of products under contract, regardless of whether they qualify for an export refund or not. Where the products qualify for a refund, proof of export is offered using the documents laid down in Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(6). With a view to simplifying the monitoring operations, a similar procedure should be introduced for the proof to be offered when products are exported without a refund.\n(3) In order to ensure the proper operation of the private storage aid introduced pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2179/2002 of 6 December 2002 on special conditions for the granting of private storage aid for pigmeat(7), the proposed amendments should apply immediately to the contracts concluded under that Regulation.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. The following paragraph is added to Article 7:\n\"3.
