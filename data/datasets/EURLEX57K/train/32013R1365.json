That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That application concerns the authorisation of a new use of a preparation of alpha-galactosidase produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 615.94) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 120604) as a feed additive for minor poultry species for fattening and for chickens reared for laying, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 237/2012\u00a0(2).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concludes in its opinion of 18 June 2013\u00a0(3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of alpha-galactosidase produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 615.94) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 120604) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and it has the potential to be efficacious on chickens reared for laying and that can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of alpha-galactosidase produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 615.94) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 120604) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 237/2012 of 19 March 2012 concerning the authorisation of alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CBS 615.94) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 120604) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Kerry Ingredients and Flavours) (OJ L 80, 20.3.2012, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(7):3286.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
