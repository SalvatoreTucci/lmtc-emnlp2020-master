The request is justified as the economic situation in Ceuta requires the adoption of preferential measures to facilitate its exports to the Community.\n(4) In view of the late transmission of the request the Council has not been able to adopt before 31 December 1999 a Regulation extending the validity of these quotas. These quotas are, therefore, reopened by the present Regulation.\n(5) In the interests of rationalising implementation of the measures concerned, it is appropriate not to limit the validity of these quotas solely to the year 2000 but to extend it to the end of the year 2002.\n(6) The quota period runs from 1 January to 31 December each year. As this Regulation will be applicable only from 1 April 2000 the quota period for 2000 should run from 1 April to 31 December, with the quota volume remaining the same as for the whole year.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2) codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.\n(8) Eligibility for the tariff quotas introduced by this Regulation is subject to the definition of preferential origin specified in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(3),", "main_body": ["In 2000 from 1 April to 31 December and in 2001 and 2002 from 1 January to 31 December, the customs duties applicable on importation into the Community of the products in question, originating in Ceuta, shall be suspended at the level and within the limits of the annual Community tariff quotas shown below:\n>TABLE>", "Proof of the products' originating status shall be adduced in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1135/88 of 7 March 1988 concerning the definition of the concept of \"originating products\" and methods of administrative cooperation in the trade between the customs territory of the Community, Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands(4).", "The tariff quota referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2000.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 March 2000.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nF.
