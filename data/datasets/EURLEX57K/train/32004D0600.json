In this undertaking, the exporting producer in question has offered to sell the product concerned at or above price levels that eliminate the injurious effect of dumping.\n(5) The company will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, meaning that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission.

Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate amount of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.\n(8) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking, or a suspected breach, an anti-dumping duty may be imposed pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation,", "main_body": ["The undertaking offered by the exporting producer mentioned below, in connection with the present anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain poly(ethylene terephthalate) originating in Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Pakistan is hereby accepted.\nCountry Manufacturer TARIC additional code\nAustralia Leading Synthetics Pty Ltd A503", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 August 2004.\nFor the Commission\nPascal LAMY\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.
