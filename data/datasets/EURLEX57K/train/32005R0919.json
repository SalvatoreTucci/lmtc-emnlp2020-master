That resolution established procedures for the identification of countries whose vessels had fished for tuna and tuna-like species in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. It also specified measures to be taken, including if necessary non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures, in order to prevent those countries\u2019 vessels from continuing such fishing practices.\n(4) Since the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT has identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels.\n(5) ICCAT has also identified Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic blue-fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures.\n(6) ICCAT has furthermore identified Sierra Leone as country whose vessels fish Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures.\n(7) Imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004\u00a0(2).\n(8) Imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna originating in Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 826/2004\u00a0(3).\n(9) Imports of Atlantic swordfish originating in Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 828/2004\u00a0(4).\n(10) At its 14th Special Meeting in 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of trade-restrictive measures against those three countries.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) Regulations (EC) No 826/2004 and (EC) No 828/2004 should accordingly be repealed,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
