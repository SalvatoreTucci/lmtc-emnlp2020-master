Moreover, the adaptations to the Act of Accession should be limited to what is absolutely necessary.\n(4) The \u2018semi-subsistence\u2019 and \u2018producer group\u2019 measures provided for in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania are covered by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005 as transitional measures for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia. Therefore, the provisions set out in the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania in these areas should be deleted.\n(5) The provisions on technical assistance provided for in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania are covered by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005 and should consequently be deleted.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005 establishes a compulsory Leader axis within the rural development programme, which must account for a minimum percentage of EAFRD contribution to the programme. In addition, Article\u00a059 of that Regulation establishes a measure aimed at supporting capacity building, which differs from the arrangements that were negotiated for Bulgaria and Romania. Therefore it is necessary to harmonise the provisions on Leader set out in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania with the new provisions provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005 provides for a support for the use of advisory services. However, there are differences between the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania and that Regulation in the scope of that measure. So as to avoid, notably, double financing, for the three first years of the programme, Bulgaria and Romania should be given the choice of implementing either the measure provided for in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession or the measure provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005.\n(8) Furthermore, when reaching political agreement on Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005, the Council and the Commission agreed in a joint declaration regarding Bulgaria and Romania to extend the measure on advisory services provided for in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania until 2013 as regards the provision of advisory services to farmers receiving semi-subsistence support. Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession should be adapted to take this agreement into account.\n(9) Given that Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01290/2005 of 21\u00a0June\u00a02005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3) has established a single Fund for Community support for rural development replacing the previous two sources of funding, it is necessary to\u00a0clarify the basis on which the 20\u00a0% ceiling specified in the complement to direct payments measure provided for in point\u00a0E of Section\u00a0I of Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania should be calculated.\n(10) Community support provided for in point E of Section\u00a0I of Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania aims at co-financing national direct payments or aids under Article\u00a0143c of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01782/2003 of 29\u00a0September\u00a02003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations\u00a0(EEC) No\u00a02019/93, (EC) No\u00a01452/2001, (EC) No\u00a01453/2001, (EC)\u00a0No\u00a01454/2001, (EC)\u00a01868/94, (EC) No\u00a01251/1999, (EC) No\u00a01254/1999, (EC)\u00a0No\u00a01673/2000, (EEC)\u00a0No\u00a02358/71 and\u00a0(EC) No\u00a02529/2001\u00a0(4). For this reason, that support should not be taken into account for the calculation of the balance between objectives described in Article\u00a017 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005 no longer includes economic viability as an eligibility condition of the measure concerning investment support. The related derogation provided for Bulgaria and Romania in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession should consequently be deleted.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01290/2005 establishes new rules concerning the financing of expenditure on rural development. Since those provisions follow the same principles as Articles\u00a031 and\u00a032 of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01260/1999 of 21\u00a0June\u00a01999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds\u00a0(5), which are referred to\u00a0in the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the specific financial provisions provided in Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession are no longer necessary. In addition, there is a need to modify in that Annex the financial contribution of the Community for agri-environment and animal welfare measures since, in accordance with Article\u00a070 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01698/2005, the co-financing rates are no longer set at measure but at axis level,", "main_body": ["Annex\u00a0VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania shall be amended as follows:\n1.
