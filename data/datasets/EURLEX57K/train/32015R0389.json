Moreover, no EN standard laying down a method equivalent to the ISO 2908 method has been established by the European Committee for Standardization. The customs laboratories should therefore be free to apply appropriate working methods of their choice for determining the content of oil in products of subheadings 2712\u00a090\u00a031 to 2712\u00a090\u00a039 of the Combined Nomenclature.\n(4) Furthermore, it is appropriate to indicate clearly in point (a) of Additional note 4 to Chapter 27 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature that the oil content is to be determined as a percentage by weight.\n(5) As a consequence, it is appropriate to amend point (a) of Additional note 4 to Chapter 27 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature by removing the reference to the international standard which has been withdrawn and clarifying the unit in which the oil content is to be expressed.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 27 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, point (a) of Additional note 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) with an oil content of 3,5 % by weight or higher, if their viscosity at 100\u00a0\u00b0C is lower than 9 \u00d7 10\u2013 6 m2 s\u2013 1 by the EN ISO 3104 method; or\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2015.\nFor the Commission,\nOn behalf of the President,\nHeinz ZOUREK\nDirector-General for Taxation and Customs Union\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01."}
