When those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of such directives, inter alia by supplementing them with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision\u00a01999/468/EC.\n(5) Directive 91/675/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the amendments made to Directive\u00a091/675/EEC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
