Permitting the use of pentaBDE in aircraft emergency evacuation systems would maintain aircraft safety by preventing the use of older emergency systems.\n(7) Directive 76/769/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) This Directive should apply without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers, in particular Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(3), and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)\u00a0(4).\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives on the removal of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1 January 2005 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
