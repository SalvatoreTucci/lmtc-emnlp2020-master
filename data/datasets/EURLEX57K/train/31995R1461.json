Furthermore, in specifically substantiated cases brought before the  competent authorities, the abovementioned date of 1 January 1990 may be backdated to 1 January  1989.`;\n(2)  in Article 3 (2) the number of livestock units per hectare, '0,5`, shall be replaced by  '1,0`;\n(3)  in Article 3, paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following:\n'3.  A number of premium rights equivalent to 0,5 LU shall be allocated per hectare converted to  extensive livestock production. In addition, where land is converted to the rearing of suckler  cows, a number of animals equal to 45  % of the number of suckler cow premium rights allocated each  year under this Regulation shall be added with effect from the next calendar year to the regional  ceiling referred to in Article 4b of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68.`;\n(4)  in Article 4, the second indent shall be replaced by the following:\n'-  an undertaking to use the converted land for extensive livestock production;` (5)  in Article 8, paragraph (b) shall be replaced by the following:\n'(b)  checks to ascertain that the land declared eligible under this Regulation is duly converted  to extensive livestock production within the time limit laid down.`;\n(6)  Article 9 shall be replaced by the following:\n'Article 9 1.  The area converted under this Regulation and corresponding to all admissible applications  during each marketing year shall, from the following marketing year, be deducted from the regional  base area or, where applicable, the individual base area provided for in Article 2 (2) or (3) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.\n2.  In addition to the deduction referred to in paragraph 1, where the land is converted to the  rearing of suckler cows, a number of hectares equal to 54  % of the number of suckler cow premium  rights allocated each year to producers shall, from the following marketing year, be deducted from  the base area.\n3.  The Portuguese authorities shall notify the Commission each year of the total area converted  under this Regulation so that the regional base area can be amended in good time.\n4.  Converted land shall be considered as permanent pasture as referred to in Article 9 of  Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.`.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 June 1995.\nFor the Council The President Ph.
