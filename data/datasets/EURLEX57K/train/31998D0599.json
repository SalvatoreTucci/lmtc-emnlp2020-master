whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approved certification body is required;\nWhereas Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;\nWhereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;\nWhereas the procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The products and families of products set out in Annex I shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby the manufacturer has under its sole responsibility a factory production control system ensuring that the product is in conformity with the relevant technical specifications.", "The products set out in Annex II shall have their conformity attested by a procedure whereby, in addition to a factory production control system operated by the manufacturer, an approved certification body is involved in assessment and surveillance of the production control or of the product itself.", "The procedure for attesting conformity as set out in Annex III shall be indicated in mandates for guidelines for European technical approvals.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 October 1998.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.\n(2) OJ L 220, 30. 8. 1993, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nLiquid applied roof waterproofing kits\nFor all uses, excluding those subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A (1), B (2), C (3).\n(1) Materials for which the reaction to fire performance is susceptible to change during production (in general, those subject to chemical modification, e.g. fire retardants, or where changes of composition may lead to changes in reaction to fire performance).\nANNEX II\nLiquid applied roof waterproofing kits:\nFor uses subject to reaction to fire regulations for products made of materials falling into classes A (1), B (2), C (3).\n(1) Materials for which the reaction to fire performance is susceptible to change during production (in general, those subject to chemical modification, e.g. fire retardants, or where changes of composition may lead to changes in reaction to fire performance).\nANNEX III\nNote: For kits having more than one of the intended uses specified in the following families, the tasks for the approved body, derived from the relevant systems of attestation of conformity, are cumulative.\nPRODUCT FAMILY\nLIQUID APPLIED ROOF WATERPROOFING KITS (1/3)\n1.
