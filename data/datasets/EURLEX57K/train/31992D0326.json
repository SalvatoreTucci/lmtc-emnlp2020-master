This reference framework will increase the comparability of data  between the different service sectors and the various Member States, despite the fact that service activities vary from one country to another because of different practices and legal systems. The methodological framework will be used as the basic  harmonization tool for the development of official European statistics on services and as a recommended framework for non-official statistics, particularly for market research.\nThe establishment and the implementatin of the methodological framework will proceed in phases taking account, inter alia, of the progressive identification of users' needs and priorities.\n(c) Setting up a European statistical information system for services\nThe collected data will be integrated into the Mercure statistical information system which will encompass:\n- official data collected under national statistical systems,\n- data from other Eurostat projects on services,\n- non-official data that may be collected by Eurostat in cooperation with other Community services.\nWhen supplying official data, the Member States will forward to the Commission any information concerning the reliability thereof which could restrict the arrangements for its use or publication.\nThe Member States will forward confidential data in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on Statistical Office of the European Communities (1).\nThis data will relate primarily to the following sectors:\n- distributive trade,\n- hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and travel agencies,\n- transport,\n- financial services (including insurance),\n- communications and information services, audio-visual services,\n- business services.\nThe data in the Mercure information system will be made available through:\n- a data base to be set up by the Commission,\n- statistical pubications on all service sectors, gradually incorporating all variables dealt with.\nAs regards non-commercial services to individuals and the community, the Commission will initiate an exploratory study on concepts and definitions during the period 1992 to 1993, intended to establish whether, and, if so, what information is necessary  in the Member States for measuring the importance of the following sectors:\n- social security,\n- education,\n- health and social work,\n- activities of membership organizations,\n- recreational, cultural and sporting activities,\n- other services to individuals and the community.\n(d) Carrying out pilot surveys of service enterprises\nImproving the availability of data on services the carrying out of pilot surveys in Member States which do not have comparable survey instruments in certain service sectors. The pilot surveys will supply preliminary data for the sectors covered and  prepare the way for regular data collection based on the methodology. These pilot surveys will be carried out in accordance with the concepts and methods developed in the methodological framework, will cover only the service sectors and will be carried  out only in the Member States where there is insufficient data.\nPriority will be given to those activities which are most dynamic and to those which are least covered by existing statistics.\n(e) Developing basic statistical tools\nBasic statistical tools must be developed in order to semplify as far as possible data collection procedures for enterprises, whilst maintaining data quality. These statistical tools are part of an infrastructure common to both industry and services.  These include registers, EDI (electronic data interchange) techniques, classification systems, sampling, questionnaires, survey processing tools and research into the convergence of statistical and accounting concepts.\n(1) OJ No L 151, 15. 6. 1991, p. 1."}
