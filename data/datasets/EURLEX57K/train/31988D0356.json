The drawback procedure provides facilities for such a refund.\nSince, however, such refunds may encourage the importation of foreign goods for which equivalents are available from domestic sources, some restriction on the granting of such refund may be considered necessary in respect of particular categories of goods or particular processing or manufacturing operations. The extent to which drawback may be granted will have to be specified as necessary by individual countries.\nThis Annex covers not only the granting of drawback in cases where the goods have undergone processing, manufacture or repair, but also the possibility of granting drawback in cases where goods have been imported and are subsequently re-exported in the same state. The Annex does not cover, however, repayment made on grounds of equity, for example, when goods are returned to the supplier as being not in accordance with contract. Neither does the Annex cover the repayment on exportation of duties and taxes other than import duties and taxes.\nDEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n(a) the term \u2018drawback procedure\u2019 means the customs procedure which, when goods are exported, provides for a refund (total or partial) to be made in respect of the import duties and taxes charged on the goods, or on materials contained in them or used up in their production;\n(b) the term \u2018drawback\u2019 means the amount of import duties and taxes repaid unter the drawback procedure;\n(c) the term \u2018import duties and taxes\u2019 means customs duties and all other duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are collected on or in connection with the importation of goods, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered.\nPRINCIPLE\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nThe drawback provisions shall be governed by the provisions of this Annex.\nSCOPE\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standard\nNational legislation shall specify the cases in which drawback may be claimed and the conditions under which it is paid.\nNote 1\nThe cases where drawback may be claimed may be specified by reference to certain goods or classes of goods or to certain uses of goods.
