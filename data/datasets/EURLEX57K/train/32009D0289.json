The Latvian banking sector has experienced serious liquidity and confidence problems. The level of foreign currency reserves has decreased as the central bank intervened to preserve the currency peg.\n(2) The Council regularly reviews the economic policies implemented by Latvia, in particular in the contexts of Latvia\u2019s convergence programme and National Reform Programme, as well as in the context of Convergence Reports.\n(3) Latvia\u2019s total external financing needs up to the first quarter of 2011 are estimated at EUR 7,5 billion.\n(4) The Latvian authorities have requested substantial financial assistance from the EU and other international financial institutions and countries to support balance of payments sustainability.\n(5) There is a serious threat to the Latvian balance of payments which justifies the urgent granting of mutual assistance by the Community in conjunction with the IMF and other contributors. In addition, in view of the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.\n(6) The financial assistance package would be provided subject to a strong commitment from the Latvian authorities to implement an ambitious fiscal, financial system and structural reform programme to facilitate the necessary external and internal adjustments, to stabilise the economy and to restore economic policy credibility. The Commission will review regularly and closely, in collaboration with the EFC, that the economic policy conditions attached to the assistance are fully implemented,", "main_body": ["The Community shall grant mutual assistance to Latvia.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 January 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
