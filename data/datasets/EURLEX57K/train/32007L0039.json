Proposals for the review of Community MRLs were submitted to the Commission.\n(2) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number Codex MRLs for diazinon. The Community MRLs based on Codex MRLs have also been evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in the light of the new information on the risk for the consumers.\n(3) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to diazinon via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(2). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.\n(4) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to diazinon via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC, to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.\n(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community\u2019s trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account.\n(7) Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 27 December 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
