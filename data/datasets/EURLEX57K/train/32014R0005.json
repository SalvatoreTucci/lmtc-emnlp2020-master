The other applications concern new particular nutritional purposes with respect to the requirement established in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009.\n(3) In addition, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, the Commission received an application to add the particular nutritional purpose \u2018Reduction of iodine levels in feed in case of hyperthyroidism\u2019 as regards cats.\n(4) A specific way of feeding is the administration of a bolus. In order to guarantee an appropriate and safe use of a bolus as feed for particular nutritional purposes, general requirements should be established for the conditions associated with certain intended uses.\n(5) The Commission made all applications, including the dossiers, available to the Member States.\n(6) The dossiers included in the applications demonstrate that the specific composition of the respective feeds fulfil the particular intended nutritional purposes \u2018Nutritional restoration, convalescence\u2018 as regards dogs, \u2018Stabilisation of physiological digestion\u2019\u2018Reduction of iodine levels in feed in case of hyperthyroidism\u2019 as regards cats, \u2018Support the preparation for and recovery from sport effort\u2019 as regards equidae, \u2018Compensation for insufficient iron availability after birth\u2019 as regards suckling piglets and calves, \u2018Support the regeneration of hooves, trotters and skin\u2019 as regards horses, ruminants and pigs, \u2018Support the preparation for oestrus and reproduction\u2019 as regards mammals and birds and \u2018Long-term supply of grazing animals with trace elements and/or vitamins\u2019 as regards ruminants with a functional rumen.\n(7) Furthermore, the evaluation showed that the feeds concerned have no adverse effects on animal health, human health, the environment or animal welfare. The evaluation of the dossiers included verification that the characterisation \u2018high level of a certain feed additive\u2019 implies an important level of the respective additive which is close to the relevant fixed maximum content in complete feed but not exceeding this content.\n(8) The applications are therefore valid and the particular nutritional purposes should be added to the list of intended uses and the conditions associated with the particular nutritional purposes \u2018Nutritional restoration, convalescence\u2019 and \u2018Stabilisation of physiological digestion\u2019 should be changed.\n(9) Directive 2008/38/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications for the feed currently legally placed on the market, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2008/38/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Feed included in the Annex to this Regulation and referred to in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 that have already been legally placed on the market before 1 September 2010 which are produced and labelled before 27 July 2014 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.
