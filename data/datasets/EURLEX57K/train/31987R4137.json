whereas it is consequently shown to be appropriate, for  reasons of clarity, to replace Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2696/77 by a new regulation taking over the new  nomenclature as well as the new legal base; whereas, for the same reasons, it is appropriate to  incorporate in this new text all the amendments made to date;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) N\u00b0 2658/87 refers to:\n- eggs not in shell and egg yolks, other than suitable for human consumption, of subheadings 0408  11 90, 0408 19 90, 0408 91 90 and 0408 99 90;\n- flour and meal of sago and of roots and tubers falling within heading N\u00b0 0714, denatured,  of subheading 1106 20 10,\n- common salt (including table salt) and pure sodium chloride, whether or not in aqueous solution,  denatured, of subheading ex 2501 00 51,\n- albumins to be rendered unfit for human consumption, of subheadings 3502 10 10 and 3502 90 10\nof  the combined nomenclature;\nWhereas entry under these subheadings is subject to conditions laid down in the relevant Community  provisions;\nWhereas, in the circumstances, these conditions would inevitably involve denaturing with a view to  rendering these products unfit for human consumption;\nWhereas for such denaturing, in order to avoid, on the one hand, disparities in the application of  the combined nomenclature as well as deflections of trade and economic activity within the  Community and to permit, on the other hand, the free circulation of denatured products, it is  agreed, in the interests of all concerned and in order to lighten as far as possible the burden  falling on national administrations, Community methods of denaturing should be established;\nWhereas, to this end, a mandatory list should be drawn up of denaturants possessing, where  necessary, specific properties; whereas this list should include an indication of the minimum  quantity of denaturant to be used for the purpose of denaturing a specified quantity of the  product; whereas, however, in order to allow for any unforeseen needs which might arise in a Member  State, provision should be made to enable the State concerned to permit the temporary use of  another denaturant;\nWhereas the denatured products in question are normally used in industries other than the animal  feed-manufacturing industry; whereas, moreover, when such products are used in the latter industry  or are consumed as such by animals, it is necessary to ensure that denaturing takes place in  accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning  additives in feedingstuffs (8), as last amended by Directive 87/317/EEC (9);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Nomenclature Committee,", "main_body": ["The entry of:\n- eggs not in shell and egg yolks, other than suitable for human consumption,\n- flour and meal of sago and of roots and tubers falling within heading N\u00b0 0714,\n- denatured common salt (including table salt) and pure sodium chloride, whether or not in aqueous  solution, denatured,\n- albumins to be rendered unfit for human con-\nsumption,\nfalling respectively within subheadings:\n- 0408 11 90, 0408 19 90, 0408 91 90 and 0408 99 90,\n- 1106 20 10,\n- ex 2501 00 51,\n- ex 3502 10 10 and ex 3502 90 10,\nof the combined nomenclature shall be subject to the condition that these goods are denatured so as  to make them unfit for human consumption by means of one of the denaturants referred to in Annexes  A, B, C and D respectively.", "The denaturing of the products referred to in Article 1 shall be carried out by using  the quantities of denaturant referred to in the Annexes to this Regulation in respect of each  denaturant.\nDenaturing shall be carried out in such a way as to ensure that the product to be denatured and the  denaturant are homogeneously mixed and cannot be separated again in a manner which is economically  viable.", "Notwithstanding Article 1, any Member State may temporarily approve the use of a  denaturant not specified in the Annexes to this Regulation.
