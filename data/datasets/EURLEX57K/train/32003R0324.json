Travel to the workshop venue\nEligible expenses for travel by train are those corresponding to a first-class ticket by the shortest route.\nAir travel reimbursement is based on economy class at the cheapest possible fare, taking account of the constraints of the journey. When the conditions of travel allow, reduced-rate fares (APEX, PEX, Excursion, etc.) will be applied. However, if the journey is separated from a weekend by no more than 24 hours, additional daily subsistence allowances may be granted in order to qualify for a reduced-rate fare, provided this results in an overall saving (travel expenses plus allowances).\nIf participants use their private car instead of travelling by air and/or train, travel expenses will be reimbursed on the basis of the first-class rail fare by the shortest route, excluding any supplements and applying the cheapest fare. If two or more persons use the same car, only the owner of the car will be entitled to reimbursement of travel expenses. Parking costs or tolls incurred in using a private car will not be refunded. Participants using their private car remain fully liable for any accidents to their car or caused by their car to third parties. The workshop organiser cannot under any circumstances accept any requests for compensation, irrespective of the reasons for which participants used their private car.\nAny negligence on the part of a participant (e.g. loss of vouchers), and its financial consequences, will remain the participant's own responsibility.\n2. Allowances\nThe following allowances applicable from 24 March 1999 (date of publication of Regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) No 620/1999, OJ L 78, 24.3.1999) will be adjusted in line with the allowances in force on the date of the workshop.\n>TABLE>\nANNEX III\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2003047EN.002002.TIF\">"}
