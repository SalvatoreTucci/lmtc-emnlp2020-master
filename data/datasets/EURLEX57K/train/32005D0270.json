thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) The formats established in Commission Decision 97/138/EC\u00a0(2), for the provision of harmonised data within the framework of Directive 94/62/EC, should be revised and simplified in order to take into account the experience with their application.\n(2) Those formats should reflect the targets laid down in Directive 94/62/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/12/EC.\n(3) In order to guarantee the comparability of data between the Member States, it is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the data to be contained in the formats and to allow Member States to provide further data on a voluntary basis.\n(4) In view of the number of amendments that must therefore be made to Decision 97/138/EC, that Decision should be replaced for the sake of clarity.\n(5)

of Directive 94/62/EC, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018composite packaging\u2019 means packaging made of different materials which cannot be separated by hand, none exceeding a given percentage by weight;\n(b) \u2018generated packaging waste\u2019 means the amount of packaging that becomes waste within the meaning of Article 1 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC\u00a0(3) within the territory of a given Member State, after having been used to contain, protect, handle, deliver and present goods;\n(c) \u2018recovered packaging waste\u2019 means the quantity of packaging waste generated in a Member State that is recovered, irrespective of whether the packaging waste is recovered within the Member State, in another Member State or outside the Community;\n(d) \u2018packaging waste recovered or incinerated at waste incineration plants with energy recovery\u2019 means the quantity of packaging waste generated in a Member State that is recovered or incinerated at waste incineration plants with energy recovery, irrespective of whether the packaging waste is recovered or incinerated at waste incineration plants with energy recovery within the Member State, in another Member State or outside the Community;\n(e) \u2018recycled packaging waste\u2019 means the quantity of packaging waste generated in a Member State that is recycled, irrespective of whether the packaging waste is recycled within the Member State, in another Member State or outside the Community;\n(f) \u2018rate of recovery or incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery\u2019 for the purposes of Article 6(1) of Directive 94/62/EC means the total quantity of packaging waste recovered or incinerated at waste incineration plants with energy recovery, divided by the total quantity of generated packaging waste;\n(g) \u2018recycling rate\u2019 for the purposes of Article 6(1) of Directive 94/62/EC means the total quantity of recycled packaging waste, divided by the total quantity of generated packaging waste.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generated packaging waste, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), shall not include any kind of residues from the production of packaging or packaging materials, or from any other production process.\nFor the purposes of this Decision, packaging waste generated in a Member State may be deemed to be equal to the amount of packaging placed on the market in the same year within that Member State.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data for total packaging shall cover all packaging as defined in Article 2(1) and 3(1) of Directive 94/62/EC.\nIn particular for materials occurring in smaller quantities and those not mentioned in this Decision, estimates may be used. These estimates shall be based on the best information available and shall be described in accordance with Article 7.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reusable packaging shall be considered to be placed on the market when it is made available for the first time, together with the goods it is intended to contain, protect, handle, deliver or present.\nReusable packaging shall not be considered packaging waste when it is sent back for reuse. Reusable packaging shall not be considered to be placed on the market as packaging when it has been reused with a good and is made available again.\nReusable packaging discarded at the end of its useful life shall be considered packaging waste.\nFor the purposes of this Decision, packaging waste generated in a particular Member State from reusable packaging may be deemed to be equal to the amount of reusable packaging placed on the market within that Member State in the same year.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Composite packaging shall be reported under the predominant material by weight.\nAdditionally, separate data on recovery and recycling of composite materials may be provided on a voluntary basis.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weight of recovered or recycled packaging waste shall be the input of packaging waste to an effective recovery or recycling process.

That description shall also give an explanation of any estimates used.", "Member States may provide, on a voluntary basis, such further data on packaging and packaging waste as is available.\nSuch data may include the following:\n(a) data on production, exports and imports of empty packaging;\n(b) data on reusable packaging;\n(c) specific sub-fractions of packaging such as composite packaging;\n(d) concentration levels of heavy metals present in packaging within the meaning of Article 11 of Directive 94/62/EC, and the presence of noxious and other hazardous substances and materials within the meaning of the third indent of point 1 of Annex II to that Directive;\n(e) packaging waste considered to be hazardous owing to contamination by product contents, within the meaning of Council Directive 91/689/EEC\u00a0(8) and Commission Decision 2000/532/EC\u00a0(9).", "The Member States shall provide the data using the formats set out in the Annex beginning with the data for 2003.", "0\nDecision 97/138/EC is repealed.", "1\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 March 2005.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10.
