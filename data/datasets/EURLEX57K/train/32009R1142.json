In those situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving either non-cash assets or a cash alternative. The IFRIC received requests for guidance on how an entity should account for such distributions.\n2 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) do not provide guidance on how an entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred to as dividends). IAS 1 requires an entity to present details of dividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements.\nSCOPE\n3 This Interpretation applies to the following types of non-reciprocal distributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity as owners:\n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and equipment, businesses as defined in IFRS 3, ownership interests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in IFRS 5); and\n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-cash assets or a cash alternative.\n4 This Interpretation applies only to distributions in which all owners of the same class of equity instruments are treated equally.\n5 This Interpretation does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that is ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the distribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the distribution.\n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Interpretation does not apply when the non-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before and after the distribution. Paragraph B2 of IFRS 3 states that \u2018A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an entity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\u2019 Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of this Interpretation on the basis that the same parties control the asset both before and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders receiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual arrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the distribution.\n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Interpretation does not apply when an entity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but retains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that results in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its subsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with IAS 27 (as amended in 2008).\n8 This Interpretation addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a non-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by shareholders who receive such a distribution.\nISSUES\n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute the assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the dividend payable. Consequently, this Interpretation addresses the following issues:\n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable?\n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable?\n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it account for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable?\nCONSENSUS\nWhen to recognise a dividend payable\n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is appropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, which is the date:\n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board of directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the shareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or\n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of directors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval.\nMeasurement of a dividend payable\n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a dividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed.\n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash asset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend payable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the associated probability of owners selecting each alternative.\n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the entity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend payable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend payable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the distribution.\nAccounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an entity settles the dividend payable\n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the difference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss.\nPresentation and disclosures\n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a separate line item in profit or loss.\n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:\n(a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and end of the period; and\n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the period in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in the fair value of the assets to be distributed.\n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-cash asset, it shall disclose:\n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed;\n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the reporting period; and\n(c) the estimated fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the reporting period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the information about the method used to determine that fair value required by IFRS 7 paragraph 27(a) and (b).\nEFFECTIVE DATE\n18 An entity shall apply this Interpretation prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Retrospective application is not permitted. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies this Interpretation for a period beginning before 1 July 2009, it shall disclose that fact and also apply IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008), IAS 27 (as amended in May 2008) and IFRS 5 (as amended by this Interpretation).\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 7 of IAS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.\nAppendix\nAmendments to IFRS 5\nNon-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nParagraph 5A is added.\nSCOPE\n5A The classification, presentation and measurement requirements in this IFRS applicable to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for sale apply also to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for distribution to owners acting in their capacity as owners (held for distribution to owners).\nAfter paragraph 5A the heading and paragraph 8 are amended, and paragraph 12A is added.\nCLASSIFICATION OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUPS) AS HELD FOR SALE OR AS HELD FOR DISTRIBUTION TO OWNERS\n8 For the sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated. Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. In addition, the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, except as permitted by paragraph 9, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders\u2019 approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.\n12A A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset (or disposal group) to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution must have been initiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Actions required to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the distribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders\u2019 approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the distribution is highly probable.\nParagraph 15A and a footnote are added.\nMEASUREMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUPS) CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE\n15A An entity shall measure a non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for distribution to owners at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute\u00a0(1).\nParagraph 44D is added.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\n44D Paragraphs 5A, 12A and 15A were added and paragraph 8 was amended by IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners in November 2008. Those amendments shall be applied prospectively to non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for distribution to owners in annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Retrospective application is not permitted. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for a period beginning before 1 July 2009 it shall disclose that fact and also apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations (as revised in 2008), IAS 27 (as amended in May 2008) and IFRIC 17.\nAmendment to IAS 10\nEvents after the Reporting Period\nParagraph 13 is amended.\nDIVIDENDS\n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the dividends are not recognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no obligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Costs to distribute are the incremental costs directly attributable to the distribution, excluding finance costs and income tax expense."}
