Article 3a of Decision 90/424/EEC, provides for a Community financial contribution to Member States to cover certain costs involved in taking measures to eradicate avian influenza.\n(2) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in the United Kingdom in 2007. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community\u2019s livestock population. The United Kingdom took measures, as referred to in Article 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, to combat those outbreaks.\n(3) The payment of a Community financial contribution must be made subject to the condition that the planned measures were actually implemented and that the competent authorities provided all the necessary information to the Commission within certain deadlines.\n(4) In accordance with Article 3a(3) of Decision 90/424/EEC, the Community financial contribution should be 50\u00a0% of the eligible costs incurred by the Member State.\n(5) The United Kingdom has fully complied with its technical and administrative obligations as set out in Articles 3(3) and 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC.
