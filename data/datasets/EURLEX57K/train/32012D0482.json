That test is to be carried out, in particular, with a view to detecting the presence of chloramphenicol and nitrofuran and its metabolites.\n(3) The Chinese competent authority has provided an appropriate residue monitoring plan for honey intended for export to the Union. That plan has been approved by Commission Decision 2011/163/EU of 16 March 2011 on the approval of plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Article 29 of Council Directive 96/23/EC\u00a0(3).\n(4) Honey and royal jelly are currently included in the list set out in Part II of the Annex to Decision 2002/994/EC. Propolis and bee pollen are products that also originate from apiculture and, given the specificities of the production process for those animal products, the risks to animal or public health posed by them is minimal. In addition, appropriate safety guarantees for those products are provided by the residue monitoring plan for honey intended for export submitted by China and approved by Decision 2011/163/EU. Propolis and bee pollen should therefore be included in the list of products set out in Part II of the Annex to Decision 2002/994/EC and that Decision should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Part II of the Annex to Decision 2002/994/EC, the following indent is added:\n\u2018\u2014 propolis and bee pollen\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 August 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 348, 21.12.2002, p. 154.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 17.3.2011, p. 40."}
