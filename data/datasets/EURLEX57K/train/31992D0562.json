There may be a small amount of recycled processed tallow to assist drying, but minimal effect on the residence time of particles through the system must be maintained.\nAdded Fat: Substantial amounts of tallow that are added to raw materials prior to the sterilizing phase. Ratios of tallow: raw material of 0,5: 1 up to 5: 1 are in common use. Variation in the ratios of fat recycle can affect raw material residence time  and the parameters set.\nDefatted: Raw material is made suitable for de-fatting by heat coagultion followed by mechanical pressing. The low-fat protein residue is subsequently dried and sterilized.\nSeparation: The initial separation or pre-separation of the fat from the dried and sterilized materials. This can be effected by either draining or centrifuging.\nMeal production: This generally includes pressing of the separated material to produce a press cake, except for pre-pressing systems. Subsequently the press cake or meal is ground to produce a meal suitable for distribution.\nCHAPTER I\nNATURAL FAT\nBATCH ATMOSPHERIC (BATCH (1) )  I.

After drying cooking, the material is then separated into its liquid/tallow and protein/greaves fractions, either by mechancial means or by use of solvent,  before being made into animal protein meals.\nII. Critical control points for individual plants\n1. Particle size: there should be a nominal anvil gap of . . . mm.

This state is held by adjustments to the heating and/or exhaust systems for  the prescribed time, after which the pressure is lowered at a controlled rate, back to atmospheric pressure. The material is then dried to remove all of its inherent moisture, either in the same vessel or in another of the described systems to produce a  product that can then be split into its liquid/tallow and protein/greaves fractions, normally by mechanical means, before being made into animal protein meals.\nII.

This principle of deep-fat frying takes place with the passage of the raw material through the vessel and is controlled by means of displacement and mechanical  restrictions to ensure that the cooked/dried material is discharged with all of its residual moisture removed at atmospheric pressure as water vapour.

Then, by mechanical forces (normally by pressing), the inherent liquid phases of fat and water are removed from the solids. The solids then pass to a drying/cooking system, to remove inherent moisture and produce a solid fraction  of protein/greaves which are made into animal protein meals. The liquid phase is further treated to separate and recover the fat/tallow by centrifuging. The water phase is normally evaporated before final drying.\nII.
