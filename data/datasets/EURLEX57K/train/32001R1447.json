In the interests of cohesiveness and to avoid discrimination between beneficiaries of the same programme, the derogations provided for in this Regulation must, exceptionally, be applicable to the whole programming period.\n(9) Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2019/93 of 19 July 1993 introducing specific measures for the smaller Aegean islands concerning agricultural products(5) provides for structural derogations for these islands. This Article is repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(6). The exceptional situation and geographical nature of the smaller Aegean islands constitutes an impediment to the adaptation and development of their rural areas, which can be offset by an increase in the Structural Funds' contribution,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. Article 29(3)(a) shall be amended as follows: \"(a) a maximum of 75 % of the total eligible cost and, as a general rule, at least 50 % of eligible public expenditure in the case of measures carried out in the regions covered by Objective 1. Where the regions are located in a Member State covered by the Cohesion Fund, the Community contribution may rise, in exceptional and duly justified cases, to a maximum of 80 % of the total eligible cost and to a maximum of 85 % of the total eligible cost for the outlying Greek islands which are under a handicap due to their distant location. The Community contribution for all the outermost regions may rise, in exceptional and duly justified cases, to a maximum of 85 % of the total eligible cost;\"\n2.
