This additional security of EUR 95 per tonne is justified by the different customs duties on imports in force for different categories of common wheat depending on whether the wheat is of high quality or low and medium quality.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2008\u00a0(4) temporarily suspended customs duties on imports of certain cereals for the 2007/08 marketing year, which ends on 30\u00a0June 2008, while allowing them to be reintroduced before that date should the market situation so warrant.\n(3) The temporary suspension of customs duties in respect of imports carried out on the basis of import licences issued from 4\u00a0January 2008, in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2008, has meant the temporary removal of the specific circumstances justifying the establishment of a system of specific securities additional to those inherent in import licences. In view of those new conditions applicable to imports of common wheat since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2008, the additional security of EUR 95 per tonne as provided for in Article 5(1), first subparagraph, point (b) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01249/96 can no longer be justified until such time as customs duties on imports are reinstated.\n(4) Since the publication of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2008, this additional security has however been lodged by some operators. In order to limit the financial constraints that such operators face as a result, provision should be made for the said security to be released immediately.\n(5) A derogation should therefore be granted from Regulation (EC) No\u00a01249/96.\n(6) In order to avoid the continued lodging of the additional security by operators and in view of the need to release as soon as possible the securities lodged since 4\u00a0January 2008, this Regulation should enter into force immediately.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 5(1), first subparagraph, point (b) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01249/96, the additional security referred to in the said provision shall not be required during the suspension of customs duties on imports of certain cereals as established by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2008.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The additional securities referred to in paragraph 1, which have been lodged since 4\u00a0January 2008 shall be released immediately.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 March 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.
