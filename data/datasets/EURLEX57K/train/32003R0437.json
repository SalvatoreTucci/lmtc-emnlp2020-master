Services may be either scheduled or non-scheduled.\nScheduled services\nServices possessing all the following characteristics:\n1. they are performed by aircraft for the transport of passengers, freight and/or mail for remuneration, in such a manner that on each flight seats are available for individual purchase by members of the public (either directly from the airline or from its authorised agents);\n2. they are operated so as to serve traffic between the same two or more airports, either:\n(a) according to a published timetable; or\n(b) with flights so regular or frequent that they constitute a recognisably systematic series.\nNon-scheduled services\nServices for remuneration other than those reported under scheduled services. Includes taxiflights.\nPassenger services\nAll flights carrying one or more revenue passengers, and any flights listed in timetables as providing passenger services.\nAll-freight and mail services\nServices relating to scheduled or non-scheduled services performed by aircraft carrying loads other than passengers, i.e. freight and mail.\nFlights by State aircraft\nAny flight in the context of military, customs, police, protocol or firefighting services.\nPassenger units\nFor the purpose of drawing up the list of Community airports as referred to in Article 3(2) and for the transitional period referred to in Article 3(4), one passenger unit is equivalent to either one passenger or 90 kilograms of freight and mail.\nAirline\nAn air transport undertaking with a valid operating licence. Where airlines have joint-venture or other contractual arrangements requiring two or more of them to assume separate responsibility for the offer and sale of air transport products for a flight or combination of flights, the airline actually operating the flight shall be reported.\nFlight stage\nA flight stage is the operation of an aircraft from take-off to its next landing. A technical stop should not result in any flight stage being classified differently.

Where information is not available on exact aircraft seating configuration, estimated data may be provided.\nOn flight origin/destination\nTraffic on a given flight with the same flight number subdivided by airport pairs in accordance with point of embarkation and point of disembarkation on that flight. (For passengers or freight where the airport of embarkation is not known, the aircraft origin should be deemed to be the point of embarkation; similarly, if the airport of disembarkation is not known, the aircraft destination should be deemed to be the point of disembarkation).\nPassengers carried\nIncludes all passengers whose journey begins or terminates at the reporting airport. Excludes direct transit passengers.\nFreight and mail loaded/unloaded\nAny property loaded or unloaded on to or off an aircraft other than stores and baggage.
