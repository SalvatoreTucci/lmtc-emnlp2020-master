In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) To enable it to carry out the duties entrusted to it by the Treaties, the Commission must have full and reliable information. With a view to efficient management, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as \u2018Eurostat\u2019, should be able to obtain all the national statistical information necessary in order to prepare Community statistics and carry out the necessary analyses.\n(3) Article\u00a010 of the EC Treaty and Article\u00a0192 of the Euratom Treaty require Member States to facilitate the achievement of the Community's tasks. This obligation extends to providing all the requisite information. Moreover, the absence of confidential statistical data constitutes for Eurostat a considerable loss of information at Community level and makes it difficult to prepare statistics and carry out analyses on the Community.\n(4) Member States have no further cause to invoke provisions on statistical confidentiality, since it is established that Eurostat offers the same data confidentiality guarantees as the national statistical institutes. These guarantees are already to some extent enshrined in the Community Treaties, notably in Article\u00a0287 of the EC Treaty, Article\u00a0194(1) of the Euratom Treaty, and Article\u00a017 of Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No\u00a0259/68 of the Council of 29\u00a0February 1968 laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities\u00a0(4), and can be backed up by appropriate measures under this Regulation.\n(5) Any violation of statistical confidentiality protected by this Regulation should be dealt with effectively, whoever the offender may be.\n(6) Any infringement of the rules binding officials and other servants working for Eurostat, whether committed wilfully or through negligence, renders them liable to disciplinary sanctions and, if appropriate, legal penalties for violation of professional secrecy, pursuant to the combined provisions of Articles\u00a012 and 18 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities.\n(7) This Regulation applies only to the transmission to Eurostat of statistical data which, in the national statistical institutes' field of competence, are covered by statistical confidentiality, and does not affect special national or Community provisions relating to the transmission of other types of information to the Commission.\n(8) This Regulation is to be adopted without prejudice to Article\u00a0296(1)(a) of the EC Treaty, under which no Member State is required to supply information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of its security.\n(9) Implementation of the provisions contained in this Regulation, and in particular those designed to ensure the protection of confidential statistical data transmitted to Eurostat, will require human, technical and financial resources.\n(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5),", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of this Regulation is:\n(a) to authorise national authorities to transmit confidential statistical data to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as Eurostat);\n(b) to provide a guarantee that the Commission will take all necessary measures to ensure the confidentiality of data thus transmitted.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall apply to statistical confidentiality only.
