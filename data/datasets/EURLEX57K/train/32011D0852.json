It is therefore necessary to extend the risk areas in Annex I to Decision 2005/363/EC to the whole of the region of Sardinia. Consequently, since the conditions laid down in Article 5(2)(b) of Decision 2005/363/EC cannot be met anymore, the derogation granted to Italy to authorise the dispatch of pig meat from Sardinia to areas outside Sardinia, is suspended. The same applies to the derogation granted under Article 6 of that Decision, to authorise the dispatch of pig meat products and other products containing pig meat from Sardinia to areas outside Sardinia.\n(6) Decision 2005/363/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2005/363/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 118, 5.5.2005, p. 39.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nAll areas of Sardinia.\u2019"}
