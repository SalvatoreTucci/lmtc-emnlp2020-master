In such cases, it is appropriate to operate such deductions on quotas available to those Member States for other stocks in the same geographical area, taking into account the need to avoid discards in mixed fisheries.\n(6) Concerned Member States have been consulted with regard to proposed deductions and suggested certain changes which should be taken into account by the Commission to the extent justified.\n(7) Deductions provided for by this Regulation should apply without prejudice to deductions applicable to 2011 quotas pursuant to:\n\u2014 Commission Regulation (EC) No 147/2007 of 15 February 2007 adapting certain fish quotas from 2007 to 2012 pursuant to Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(10),\n\u2014 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1016/2011 of 23 September 2011 operating deductions from fishing quotas available for certain stocks in 2011, on account of overfishing of those stocks in the previous year\u00a0(11),", "main_body": ["The fishing quotas fixed in Regulations (EU) No 1124/2010, (EU) No 1225/2010, (EU) No 1256/2010, and (EU) No 57/2011 for the year 2011 are reduced as shown in the Annex.", "Article 1 shall apply without prejudice to reductions provided for in Regulations (EC) No 147/2007 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1016/2011.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0352, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0330, 16.12.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0347, 24.12.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a021, 26.1.2010, p.\u00a01.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0318, 4.12.2010, p.\u00a01.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0336, 21.12.2010, p.\u00a01.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 29.12.2010, p.\u00a02.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 27.1.2011, p.\u00a01.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a046, 16.2.2007, p.\u00a010.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0See page 1 of this Official Journal.\nANNEX\nMS Species code Area code Species name Area name Initial quota 2010 Permitted landings 2010 Total catches 2010 Overfishing related to permitted landing Overfishing related to permitted landing Multiplying factor 105(2) Multiplying factor 105(3) Deductions 2011 Initial quota 2011 Revised quantity 2011\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15)\nDNK DGS 03A-C.
