Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.\n(5) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) By a letter dated 8 July 2011 and addressed to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(8) In this respect it is noted that Commission did not identify any reason to indicate that termination would not be in the Union interest, nor was any such reason raised by interested parties. Therefore, the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain graphite electrode systems originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain graphite electrodes of a kind used for electric furnaces, with an apparent density of 1,5\u00a0g/cm3 or more and an electrical resistance of 7\u00a0\u03bc\u03a9.m or less originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, currently falling within CN code ex\u00a08545\u00a011\u00a000 and nipples used for such electrodes currently falling within CN code ex\u00a08545\u00a090\u00a090, is hereby terminated.", "The Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 September 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C 343, 17.12.2010, p. 24."}
