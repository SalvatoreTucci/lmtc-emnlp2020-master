Most of the equivalence arrangements signed by the Commission and third countries have been unilaterally applied by the European Commission which has not been conducive to the promotion of a level playing field. It was found that equivalence recognition with third countries should be established through international agreements. Therefore, the current scheme of recognition of third countries for the purpose of equivalence based on equivalence arrangements should shift to a scheme based on balanced international agreements with a view to promoting a level playing field, transparency and legal certainty.\n(4) In order to facilitate the transition to the new scheme of recognition based on international agreements, it is appropriate to introduce a final date for receiving new requests for inclusion in the list provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 and set out in Annex III to that Regulation. Requests received after that date should no longer be admissible.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall consider whether to include a third country in the list provided for in Article 7 upon receipt of a request for inclusion from the representative of the third country concerned, provided that such request is submitted before 1 July 2014.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0189, 20.7.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 of 8 December 2008 laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries (OJ L\u00a0334, 12.12.2008, p.\u00a025)."}
