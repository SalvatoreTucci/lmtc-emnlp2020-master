whereas in addition the Scientific Veterinary Committee has recommended that specified risk material (SRM), which are defined as:\n(a) the skull, including the brain and eyes but excluding the tongue, and spinal cord of:\n- bovine animals aged over 12 months,\n- ovine and caprine animals aged over 12 months or which have a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum;\n(b) the spleen of animals of the ovine and caprine species;\nshould be excluded from the food and feed chains;\nWhereas, in November 1996, Ireland presented to the Commission a plan laying down supplementary measures to control and eradicate BSE in Ireland, hereafter referred to as 'the plan`, whereas Ireland has, on 24 February 1997, presented an amended version of the plan;\nWhereas the principal elements of the plan are:\n(a) compulsory slaughter and destruction of suspect cases of BSE and, if confirmed, slaughter and destruction of all animals in herds where cases of BSE have occurred;\n(b) identification and slaughter of animals exposed to the same risks as the affected animals;\n(c) measures to exclude SRM from the food and feed chains;\n(d) prohibition on the use of meat-and-bone meal containing SRM and recall of existing stocks.\nWhereas a programme to control BSE and reduce the number of future cases should concentrate on removal of animals most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in accordance with the principle laid down in point 6 of the conclusions of the Council meeting on 1 to 3 April 1996;\nWhereas the Council concluded that such an option should be open to Member States other than the United Kingdom on a case-by-case basis;\nWhereas the Irish authorities will carry out a full epidemiological inquiry on each case of BSE in order to identify other animals likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal and will slaughter such animals and destroy the carcases; this inquiry will include animals which may have been moved to other holdings;\nWhereas consequently the Commission can accept that the Irish programme for the eradication of BSE can be financed with a Community contribution on the basis of the same principles and in accordance with the same procedure as laid down in points 8 and 9 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996;\nWhereas the Commission, in accordance with point 9 of those Council conclusions, has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 716/96 (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2423/96 (15) and Regulation (EC) No 717/96 (16) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (17) in order to provide market support;\nWhereas a similar measure will be proposed for financial assistance to Ireland for the present plan;\nWhereas the plan presented on 13 November 1996, as amended on 24 February 1997, will contribute to a reduction in the number of BSE cases and increase the controls relating to the disease, and it should therefore be approved;\nWhereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in Ireland to verify the application of the measures provided for in this Decision;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["The plan regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy presented in November 1996 as amended on 24 February 1997 by Ireland is hereby approved.", "Ireland shall bring into force by 1 May 1997 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to implement the plan referred to in Article 1.", "1.
