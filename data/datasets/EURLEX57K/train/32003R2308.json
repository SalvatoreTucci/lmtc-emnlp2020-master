Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary that he/she has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should, however, be authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2005 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.\n(9) Given that on 1 May 2004 the European Union will be enlarged, the allocation amongst importers of the 2004 quota should be divided into two tranches, corresponding to the Union's current and future membership respectively. Acceding States should be permitted to issue import authorisations only for goods to be imported on or after 1 May.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee established by Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Regulation is to lay down rules on the management of quantitative quotas for imports of certain textile products set out in Annexes IIIB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 for the year 2004.\nThe 2004 quotas shall be allocated in two separate tranches, of which the second shall become available from 1 May 2004 for the acceding States. The quantitative limits for the tranches shall be as listed in Annex I.", "The quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be allocated according to the chronological order of receipt by the Commission of Member States' notifications of applications from individual operators, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities per operator set out in Annex II.\nThe maximum quantities shall not, however, apply to operators able to prove to the competent national authorities, when making their first application for 2004, that, in respect of given categories and given third countries, they imported more than the maximum quantities specified for each category pursuant to import licences granted to them for 2003.\nIn the case of such operators, the competent authorities may authorise imports not exceeding the quantities imported in 2003 from given third countries and in given categories, provided that enough quota capacity is available.", "Any importer who has already used up 50 % or more of the amount allocated to him/her under this Regulation may make a further application, in respect of the same category and country of origin, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities laid down in Annex II.", "1. The competent national authorities listed in Annex III may, from 10.00 on 5 January 2004, notify the Commission of the amounts covered by requests for import authorisations.\nThe time fixed in the first subparagraph shall be understood as Brussels time.\nRequests from the competent national authorities of Member States set out in section A of Annex III shall be processed initially by deduction from the first tranche. When the quantitative limit on a category of the first tranche is exhausted further requests shall be processed against the second tranche. Requests from the competent national authorities of Member States set out in section B of Annex III shall be processed only against the second tranche.\n2. The competent national authorities shall issue authorisations only after being notified by the Commission pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 that quantities are available for importation. The competent national authorities of acceding States may only issue import authorisations for goods to be imported on or after 1 May.\nThey shall issue authorisations only if an operator:\n(a) proves the existence of a contract relating to the provision of the goods; and\n(b) certifies in writing that, in respect of the categories and countries concerned:\n(i) he/she has not already been allocated an authorisation under this Regulation; or\n(ii) he/she has been allocated an authorisation under this Regulation but has used up at least 50 % of it.\n3. Import authorisations shall be valid for nine months from the date of issue, but until 31 December 2004 at the latest.\nThe competent national authorities may, however, at the importer's request, grant a three-month extension for authorisations which are at least 50 % used up at the time of the request. Such extension shall in no circumstances expire later than 31 March 2005.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 December 2003.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 1; Regulation as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1484/2003 (OJ L 212, 22.8.2003, p. 46).\n(2) OJ L 351, 28.12.2002, p. 45.\nANNEX I\nQuantitative limits for the tranches referred to in Article 1\n>TABLE>\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\nMaximum amounts referred to in Articles 2 and 3\n>TABLE>\nANNEX III\nList of licensing offices referred to in Article 4\nSection A: List of the competent national authorities in the current Member States\n1.
