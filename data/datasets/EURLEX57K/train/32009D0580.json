Reference was made in that application to some files still open. It is only on 27 December 2007 that these files were settled. The resulting payment was made by the German authorities on 8 January 2008. In the light of the explicit mention of the open files in the original application, the Commission considers that the time necessary to reach a settlement concerning them must be considered a well justified delay in the payment, which authorises the application of a zero reduction rate according to the last subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Decision 2003/745/EC.\n(5) On 19 June 2008, Germany submitted an additional official application for reimbursement as set out in Article 5(1) of Decision 2003/745/EC. The amounts in the additional request are related to expenses which were not reimbursed initially by the German authorities.\n(6) Decision 2003/745/EC and in particular Article 2(b) and (c) and Article 4 thereof shall be applicable as appropriate to this additional application.\n(7) In view of the above considerations, the amount of total financial contribution mentioned in Decision 2006/433/EC should be modified.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The text of Article 1 of Decision 2006/433/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 1\nThe total Community financial contribution towards the expenditure associated with eradication of classical swine fever in Germany in 2002 pursuant to Decision 2003/745/EC is fixed at EUR\u00a0970\u00a0167,31.\nSince two instalments of EUR\u00a0460\u00a0000 and of EUR\u00a0465\u00a0808,47 have already been granted the balance of the Community financial contribution is fixed at EUR\u00a044\u00a0358,84.\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ\u00a0L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 19.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 269, 21.10.2003, p. 18.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 173, 27.6.2006, p. 27."}
