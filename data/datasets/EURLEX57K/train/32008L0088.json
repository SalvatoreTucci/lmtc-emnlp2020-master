It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.\n(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.\n(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products, according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.\n(4) Substances for which no updated safety files are submitted allowing an adequate risk assessment should be included in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(5) Some hair dye substances have already been banned, either as a result of opinions by the SCCP or due to lack of safety data. The substances currently under consideration were carefully selected to be regulated together since they are listed in Annex IV. As no safety files on these substances for their use in hair dye products were submitted to the SCCP for a risk assessment by the agreed deadlines, there is no evidence that these substances, when used in hair dye products, can be considered safe for human health.\n(6) Substances without safety files 1-Hydroxy-2,4-diaminobenzene (2,4-Diaminophenol) and its dihydrochloride salt; 1,4-Dihydroxybenzene (Hydroquinone); [4-[[4-anilino-1-naphthyl][4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]methylene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]dimethylammoniumchloride (Basic Blue 26); Disodium 3-[(2,4-dimethyl-5-sulphonatophenyl)azo]-4-hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulpho-nate (Ponceau SX) and 4-[(4-Aminophenyl)(4-iminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene)methyl]-o-toluidine and its hydrochloride salt (Basic Violet 14), currently listed as colorants in Annex IV and as hair dye substances in Annex III, Part 1 and Part 2, shall be deleted from Annex III and banned for use in hair dye products in Annex II.\n(7) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 14 February 2009 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
