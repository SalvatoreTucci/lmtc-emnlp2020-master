The list of areas recognised as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this.\n(5) On the basis of information supplied during the above mission, it appears that Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) is present only in the States of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. Therefore, other Brazilian states should be restored to the list of areas recognised as being free of Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus).\n(6) In 2000, interceptions of fruits of Citrus sinensis originating in Swaziland, found infected by Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus), have been notified to the Commission. The list of countries recognised as being free from Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this.\n(7) Specific arrangement should be made for goods in transit for which the official statement foreseen by Annex IV, part A, section I, points 16.2 and 16.4 of Directive 2000/29/EC was issued in accordance with Decision 98/83/EC.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 98/83/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
