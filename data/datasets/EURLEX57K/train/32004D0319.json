Pending the establishment of harmonised certification requirements, the Member States have been responsible for ensuring that imports of aquaculture animals and products thereof from third countries be subjected to conditions at least equivalent to those applying to placing on the market of Community products according to Article 20(3) of Directive 91/67/EEC.\n(4) There is therefore an ongoing trade in live bivalve molluscs for the purpose of human consumption between certain third countries and certain Member States. This trade would be blocked from 1 May 2004, when Decision 2003/804/EC will be implemented.\n(5) In order not to interrupt, unnecessarily, ongoing trade from third countries that Member States have found to comply with conditions at least equivalent to those applicable for placing on the market within the Community, certain third countries should be included in Annex I to this Decision for a interim period of time, pending the completion of the on-the-spot inspections provided for by Community rules.\n(6) Such temporary listing should be limited to imports of live bivalve molluscs for the purpose of human consumption only, from areas authorised according to Council Directive 91/492/EEC(3).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 May 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 1.
