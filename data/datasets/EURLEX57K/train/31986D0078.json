Purpose of the programme\nDevelopment of the processing and marketing of fishery products, and more particularly with regard to herring and to crustaceans and molluscs.\n2. Delimitation of the area concerned by the programme\nThe whole territory of the Netherlands.\n3. Duration of the programme\nThe programme covers the period 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1990.\n4. Objective of the programme\nThe objectives of the programme are:\n- development, rationalization and improvement of the processing and marketing conditions for fishery products, particularly herring and introduction of new production techniques intended to increase the value added to the basic products,\n- improving the quality standards, more particularly with regard to crustaceans and molluscs, by investment relating to hygiene and sanitary facilities.\n5. Actions envisaged and priorities\nWithin the general framework of the programme, first priority will be the stimulation of investment concerning the processing of herring. A second priority will be given to actions aimed at improving the hygiene quality of crustaceans and molluscs, particularly with regard to shrimps and mussels.\nThe third priority will be given to investment in facilities for the production of other high-value-added products (for example: conserves and prepared dishes).\n6. Investment forecasts (million ECU)\nThe total amount of investment for the duration of the programme is 40 million ECU to attain the foreseen objectives.\nThe national aid for the duration of the programme is scheduled at 3,2 million ECU, attributed in approximately equal annual proportions.\nWith regard to the abovementioned actions, the scheduled investment can be broken down as:\n- investment into the processing of herring: 16 million ECU,\n- investment into the sector of crustaceans and molluscs: 12 million ECU,\n- other investment: 12 million ECU.\nThe financial data, as well as the breakdown between various types of investments, are indicative.\nANNEX II\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by the Netherlands Government as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis, following the adoption of the common fisheries policy, to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of the resources and of the consequences and objectives of the pluriannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture (1) for the future development of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nAs the basic measures for restructuring the fishing fleet and for developing aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission adopts the programme only for the years 1985 and 1986, in order to ensure that the structural measures with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture envisaged for 1987 and later can be adequately taken into consideration in relation to the sector for the processing and marketing of fishery products.\nGiven the resource situation and the fact that the Dutch fishing fleet has to be reduced to adapt it to these resources, the Commission considers that the priority aspects of the programme are of a qualitative nature.\nAs the processing facilities for herring have been strongly affected by the reduced catch possibilities in recent years, the Commission requests the Netherlands Government to monitor particularly this sector so as to ensure a balanced development with regard to the resources and to the marketing.\n2. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in this programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n3. The Commission considers that the programme objectives and their attainment should form the subject of a more detailed analysis in the framework of the reconsideration for the period starting from 1 January 1987 in the light of the development in the fishing industry and in aquaculture.\n(1) OJ No L 157, 15. 6. 1985."}
