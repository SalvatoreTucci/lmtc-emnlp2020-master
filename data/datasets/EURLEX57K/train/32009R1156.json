However the virus is still present in parts of the Community.\n(5) In addition, the effectiveness of the measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 is influenced by a combination of factors. Those factors include the vector species, climate conditions and the type of husbandry of the susceptible ruminants.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to continue to apply the transitional measure set out in Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, taking into account that the disease situation is not stable and still evolving. Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the introductory phrase of paragraph 1 of Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, the date \u201831 December 2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2010\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 283, 27.10.2007, p. 37."}
