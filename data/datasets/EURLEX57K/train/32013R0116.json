The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the establishment of a provisional MRL for eprinomectin for ovine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk, and the extrapolation of the MRLs for eprinomectin from ovine and bovine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk to caprine species, establishing a provisional MRL, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk.\n(6) The CVMP recommended the establishment of a provisional MRL for ovine and caprine species as the scientific data is incomplete for the proposed analytical method for monitoring residues in ovine and caprine species.\n(7) The entry for eprinomectin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the provisional MRLs for ovine and caprine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk. The provisional MRLs set out in that Table for ovine and caprine species should expire on 1 July 2014.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 10 April 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\nThe entry corresponding to eprinomectin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 is replaced by the following:\nPharmacologically active Substance Marker residue Animal Species MRL Target Tissues Other Provisions (according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009) Therapeutic Classification\n\u2018Eprinomectin Eprinomectin B1a Bovine 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Muscle NO ENTRY Antiparasitic agents/Agents acting against endo- and ectoparasites\u2019\n250\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Fat\n1\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Liver\n300\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Kidney\n20\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Milk\nOvine, caprine 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg Muscle The MRLs laid down for these animal species are provisional MRLs.
