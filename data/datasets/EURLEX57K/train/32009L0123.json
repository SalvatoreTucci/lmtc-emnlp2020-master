This Directive should fill the legal vacuum following the judgment.\n(3) Criminal penalties, which demonstrate social disapproval of a different nature than administrative sanctions, strengthen compliance with the legislation on ship-source pollution in force and should be sufficiently severe to dissuade all potential polluters from any violation thereof.\n(4) A consistent set of legislative measures has already been adopted at EU level to reinforce maritime safety and help prevent ship-source pollution. The legislation in question is addressed to flag States, ship owners and charterers, classification societies, port States and coastal States. The existing system of sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, supplementing that legislation, needs to be further strengthened by the introduction of criminal penalties.\n(5) Common rules on criminal penalties make it possible to use more effective methods of investigation and effective cooperation within and between Member States.\n(6) The Member States should also apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to legal persons throughout the Community because frequently ship-source pollution offences are committed in the interest of legal persons or for their benefit.\n(7) The applicability of Directive 2005/35/EC should not be subject to exceptions other than those set out in this Directive. Therefore, certain categories of natural and legal persons, such as cargo owners or classification societies should be included in the scope of that Directive.\n(8) This Directive should oblige Member States to provide in their national legislation for criminal penalties in respect of those discharges of polluting substances to which this Directive applies. This Directive should not create obligations regarding the application of such penalties or any other available system of law enforcement, to individual cases.\n(9) Under this Directive, illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances should be regarded as a criminal offence as long as they have been committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and result in deterioration in the quality of water. Less serious cases of illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances that do not cause deterioration in the quality of water need not be regarded as criminal offences. Under this Directive such discharges should be referred to as minor cases.\n(10) Given the need to ensure a high level of safety and protection of the environment in the maritime transport sector, as well as the need to ensure the effectiveness of the principle whereby the polluting party pays for the damage caused to the environment, repeated minor cases, which do not individually but in conjunction result in deterioration in the quality of water, should be regarded as a criminal offence.\n(11) This Directive is without prejudice to other liability systems for damage caused by ship-source pollution under Community, national or international law.\n(12) Jurisdiction with regard to criminal offences should be established in accordance with the national law of Member States and in accordance with their obligations under international law.\n(13) Member States should provide information to the Commission on the implementation of this Directive, in order to enable the Commission to evaluate its effect.\n(14) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone, by reason of the cross-border damage which may be caused by the behaviour concerned, and, by reason of scale and effects of the proposed action, can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(15) This Directive respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(16) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(6), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(17) Directive 2005/35/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 2005/35/EC\nDirective 2005/35/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the title is replaced by the following:\n2.
