The same evidence indicates that there should be additional measures to control production of ozone-depleting substances and in particular on hydrochlorofluorcarbons and new substances.\n(3) A Fourth Amendment to the Montreal Protocol introducing these controls was adopted by the Parties in December 1999 in Beijing.\n(4) The Commission, on behalf of the Community, took part in the negotiation and adoption of that amendment.\n(5) The Community has adopted measures in the area covered by the amendment, in particular in Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer(7), and it should, therefore, undertake international commitments in that area.\n(6) It is necessary for the Community to approve the Fourth Amendment to the Montreal Protocol because its provisions relate to production and trade in controlled substances between the Community and other Parties, the implementation of which is the responsibility of the Community,", "main_body": ["The Fourth Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer is hereby approved on behalf of the Community.\nThe text of this Amendment is attached to this Decision.", "The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person or persons empowered to deposit the instrument of approval of this Fourth Amendment on behalf of the Community with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in accordance with Article 13 of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer as read in conjunction with Article 3 of the Fourth Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.", "This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
