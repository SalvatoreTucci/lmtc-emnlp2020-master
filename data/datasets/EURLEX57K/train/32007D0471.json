Once these evaluations have been carried out, the Council should decide on the lifting of checks at the internal borders with the Member States concerned.\n(5) A separate Council Decision should be taken setting a date for the lifting of checks at internal borders. Until the date of the lifting of checks set out in that Decision, certain restrictions on the use of the SIS should be imposed.\n(6) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(2) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point G, of Decision 1999/437/EC\u00a0(3) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement,.", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the SIS, as referred to in Annex I, shall apply to the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic amongst themselves and in their relations with the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Republic of France, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden as well as the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway from 1 September 2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the SIS, as referred to in Annex II, shall apply to the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic amongst themselves and in their relations with the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Republic of France, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden as well as the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway from the date foreseen in those provisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 7 July 2007 real SIS data may be transferred to the Member States concerned.\nFrom 1 September 2007, the Member States concerned, like the Member States in respect of which the Schengen acquis has already been implemented, will be able to enter data into the SIS and use SIS data, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until the date of the lifting of checks at internal borders with the Member States concerned, those Member States:\n(a) shall not be obliged to refuse entry to their territory or to expel nationals of third States for whom an SIS alert has been issued by another Member State for the purposes of refusing entry;\n(b) shall refrain from entering the data covered by the provisions of Article 96 of the Convention of 19 June 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (hereinafter Schengen Convention)\u00a0(4).", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 12 June 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nW.
