That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex as a feed additive for weaned piglets, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 11 May 2011\u00a0(2) that Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC R-625, under the proposed conditions of use, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that this additive has the potential to improve the growth performance in weaned piglets. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC R-625 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9 (5):2173.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
