Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u00c2\u00b4Schlachtkoerperklassifizierungsgeraet (SKG II)'.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with electro-pneumatic calipers having a maximum pressure of three bars, an electro-mechanical angle-meter and a manually operated meter for electro-mechanical measuring of the fat by means of a potentiometer. The  results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny  = 55,69 - 0,4652x1 + 0,1210x2 - 0,0896x3 - 1,0929x4 - 0,0211x5  where   y  =  the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   x1 =  the thickness of fat (including rind) in millimetres, covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius), measured at its thinnest point,  x2 =  the width of the leg in millimetres, measured at its thickest point,  x3 =  the width of the  half-carcase at the flank in millimetres, measured at its narrowest point,  x4 =  the coefficient  x2    x3  ,  x5 =  the angle of the leg in degrees, measured against the horizontal line. The formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 110 kilograms."}
