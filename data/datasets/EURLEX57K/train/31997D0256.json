The approach of a blanket guarantee, without distinguishing regions and projects, is approved. A risk sharing element as proposed by the Commission and the EIB is accepted. Accordingly, the EIB is invited where possible to secure, on a significant proportion of its lending, adequate third-party guarantees for commercial risks, with the Budgetary guarantee in that case being responsible only for political risks arising from currency non-transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance. The EIB is invited to aim at 25 % of its total lending under the mandates as a target for the use of non-sovereign guarantees to be expanded on wherever possible insofar as the market permits on an individual mandate basis. The application of the target to individual mandates is to be specified at the time of negotiation of those mandates.`;\n(15) Whereas this Decision should conform to the above conclusions;\n(16) Whereas a guarantee level of 70 % is sufficient to meet the total lending volume of the new lending mandates and other lending needs for the duration of this Decision;\n(17) Whereas the new guarantee arrangements will not affect the excellent credit standing of the EIB;\n(18) Whereas the Council concluded on 2 December 1996 that 'the provisioning rates of the Guarantee Fund will remain at the current levels up to 1999`; whereas the Council concluded on 27 January 1997 that 'each payment to the loan guarantee fund will be based on the percentage required at the time of payment, that is 15 % currently and 14 % as soon as feasible`;\n(19) Whereas the Commission and the EIB recognizing their respective areas of responsibility should ensure appropriate coordination between EIB operations in the eligible third countries and the implementation of the Community's other financial instruments;\n(20) Whereas the Commission and the EIB should consult together in order to ensure that, in determining the rate at which the mandates are used, account will be taken of the annual fluctuations in the rate at which the Community is being asked to provide balance of payments support to third countries;\n(21) Whereas the Council has approved this Decision and in particular the amounts of the mandates taking into account its conclusions of 27 January 1997 according to which: 'Member States and the Commission unanimously declare that they agree to the creation of a substantial pre-accession support facility. They invite the EIB to propose such a facility to the Board of Governors later this year. The facility will enter into force as soon as possible in the light of future accession. The facility will be approved under Article 18 of the EIB statute and carry no guarantee from the Community budget or from the Member States. The EIB lending envelopes covered by a Community guarantee can be considered to be consistent with a provision of ECU 1 050 million for macro-financial assistance (MFA) assuming that ECU 750 million is needed for Euratom lending; whereas the maximum for MFA should be increased to ECU 1 200 million, if Euratom lending in the period of application of the present decision does not exceed ECU 600 million.`;\n(22) Whereas, for the purpose of adopting this Decision, the only powers provided for by the Treaty are those set out in Article 235,", "main_body": ["1.
