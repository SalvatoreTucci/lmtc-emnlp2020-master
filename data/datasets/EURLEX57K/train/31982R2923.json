GENERAL DIRECTIONS CONCERNING DENATURING AND INCORPORATION\nA. It is not permitted to submit skimmed-milk powder in its natural state or after denaturing to a chemical or physical process capable of weakening or neutralizing the effects of denaturing by the formulae specified in Sections 1 and 2.\nThis prohibition includes the binding agents of metals (copper, iron) and agents deodorizing or modifying the taste and smell of fish meal, referred to in Section 2, by eliminating one or more ingredients responsible for the gustatory and/or olfactory perception characteristic of the products in question and adding one or more ingredients giving a taste and/or smell superimposed on those of the natural product.\nNor may the ground oilseed cake or dry defatted colza and/or rape seed meal, as referred to in formulae I J and I K, have been submitted to heat treatment, even in the presence of water or steam etc., or to other chemical or microbiological treatment etc. intended to change their composition.\nAnti-caking and flowing agents may be used for the application of the formulae in Section 1 and in addition to the products mentioned, up to a maximum level of 2 % of the mixture of skimmed-milk powder and its denaturing agents.\nB. The following must have at least 50 % m m of their particles less than 500 microns in size:\n- products of vegetable origin intended for animal feed, as referred to in formulae I H to I I,\n- ground oilseed cake and dry defatted colza and/or rape seed meal, as referred to in formulae I J and I K,\n- ground cereals, ground oilseed cake and fibre in whatever form, used separately or mixed together, as referred to in formulae II L to II U.\n- the hay and/or straw meal, as referred to in formula I L.\nFor the application of formulae I H to I L:\n- ferrous sulphate must be finely ground and must have at least 30 % m m of its particles less than 250 microns in size,\n- copper sulphate must be finely ground and must have at least 70 % m m of its particles less than 200 microns in size,\n- starch must have at least 50 % m m of its particles less than 80 microns in size.\nGrass meal and lucerne meal, as referred to in formulae II M, II N and II P, used separately or mixed together, must have at least 50 % m m of their particles less than 300 microns in size.\nFor skimmed-milk powder denatured in the United Kingdom or Ireland the particle sizes given in BS 410: 1976 that are closest to, but not lower than, the maximum dimensions specified shall be considered as equivalent.\nThe method to be used for determining ITC and VTO content shall be that set out in draft International Standard ISO/DIS 5504.\n'Ground cereals' means products suitable for animal feed fully milled from oats, barley, or other cereals, or from a mixture thereof or from by-products of milling to which fibre has, if necessary, been added.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n- ground dried sugar beet pulp is considered equivalent to ground cereals,\n- straw meal is considered equivalent to grass meal.\nWhen skimmed-milk powder is denatured using the formulae in Section 1, copper sulphate and starch must be incorporated before or at the same time as any other product used apart from anti-caking agents and flowing agents as referred to in the fourth paragraph of subsection A. C. The minimum quantities of the products to be incorporated in the skimmed-milk powder, as given in the formulae in Section 1, are without prejudice to other provisions relating to the maximum quantities of additives which may be contained in animal feed, and in particular the provisions laid down pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs.\nThe minimum crude fibre content required for the formulae in Section 2 is without prejudice to the provisions laid down pursuant to Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs.\nD. The products added to skimmed-milk powder when the formulae in Section 1 are used must be distributed in a uniform manner so that when two 50 g samples drawn at random from a 25 kg batch are chemically analyzed the results are the same for both samples within the tolerated error limits of the analysis method used.\nThe provisions adopted pursuant to Council Directive 70/373/EEC of 20 July 1970 on the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of feedingstuffs shall apply to the control of denaturing.\n(1) This shall be reduced to 4 % if the end product is to be used as poultry feed and is packaged and labelled accordingly."}
