Such a network could be extended to institutions in third countries with which the Union is conducting specific dialogues in connection with non-proliferation.\n(6) On 15-16 December 2005, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018EU SALW Strategy\u2019) which sets the guidelines for the action of the Union in the field of SALW. The EU SALW Strategy considers that the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition pose a serious threat to international peace and security.\n(7) The EU SALW Strategy identifies among its objectives the need to foster effective multilateralism so as to forge mechanisms, whether international, regional or within the Union and its Member States, for countering the supply and destabilising spread of SALW and their ammunition,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of contributing to the enhanced implementation of the EU WMD Strategy, which is based on the principles of effective multilateralism, prevention and cooperation with third countries, a European network of independent non-proliferation think tanks is hereby established to further the following objectives:\n(a) to encourage political and security-related dialogue and long-term discussion of measures to combat the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems within civil societies, and more particularly among experts, researchers and academics;\n(b) to provide those participating in the relevant preparatory bodies of the Council with the opportunity to consult the network on issues related to non-proliferation and to enable the representatives of Member States to participate in the network\u2019s meetings chaired by the representative of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR);\n(c) to constitute a useful stepping stone for non-proliferation action by the Union and the international community, in particular by providing a report and/or recommendations to the representative of the HR;\n(d) to contribute to enhancing awareness of third countries of proliferation challenges and of the need to work in cooperation with the Union and in the context of multilateral fora, in particular the United Nations, to prevent, deter, halt and where possible, eliminate proliferation programmes of concern worldwide.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the EU SALW Strategy, the scope of activities of the proposed European network of independent non-proliferation think tanks shall not be limited to addressing questions related to the threats posed by the proliferation of WMD, but shall also cover issues related to conventional weapons, including SALW.

VANACKERE\nANNEX\nTHE EUROPEAN NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT NON-PROLIFERATION THINK TANKS IN SUPPORT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU STRATEGY AGAINST PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (EU WMD STRATEGY)\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Objectives\nThe objective of this Decision is to implement the policy recommendation, laid down by the Council on 8 December 2008 in a document \u2018New lines for action by the European Union in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems\u2019. According to this document, the action of the Union to counter proliferation could benefit from the support provided by a non-governmental non-proliferation network, bringing together foreign policy institutions and research centres specialising in the Union\u2019s strategic areas while building on useful networks which already exist. Such a network could be extended to institutions in third countries with which the Union is conducting specific dialogues in connection with non-proliferation.\nThis network of independent non-proliferation think tanks would aim to encourage political and security-related dialogue and the long-term discussion of measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems within civil societies, and more particularly among experts, researchers and academics. It will constitute a useful stepping stone for non-proliferation action by the Union and the international community.\nThe work of the network is to be extended to issues related to conventional weapons, including small arms and light weapons (SALW), including measures to ensure the continuous implementation of the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition (EU SALW Strategy). The network will help to develop new facets of the Union\u2019s action to cover both the preventive and reactive dimensions of security issues related to conventional weapons, including the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition, as foreseen by the EU SALW Strategy. Preventing the illegal and unregulated trade of conventional weapons, including SALW, has also been recognised as a priority of the Union in the framework of the Arms Trade Treaty process.\nThe network could contribute to enhancing awareness of third countries of challenges related to WMD proliferation and conventional weapons, including the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition, and of the need to work in cooperation with the Union and in the context of multilateral fora, in particular the United Nations, in order to prevent, deter, halt and where possible, eliminate proliferation programmes of concern worldwide and the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition.\nThe Union wishes to support this network as follows:\n\u2014 through organising a kick-off meeting and an annual conference with a view to submitting a report and/or recommendations to the representative of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR),\n\u2014 through creating an Internet platform to facilitate contacts and foster research dialogue among the network of non-proliferation think tanks.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organisation of the network\nThe network will be open to all relevant research institutes from the Union and think tanks and be fully respectful of the diversity of opinion within the Union.\nThe network will facilitate contacts between non-governmental experts, Member States\u2019 representatives and the institutions of the Union. The network will stand ready to engage with non-governmental actors from third countries in line with the EU WMD and SALW Strategies, which are based on the concepts of multilateralism and international cooperation. The network\u2019s mandate will cover non-proliferation of WMD, their delivery systems, and issues related to conventional weapons, including SALW.\nThe network will be chaired by the representative of the HR, in accordance with the guidelines defined within the framework of the WMD Monitoring Centre with regard to non-proliferation measures. The participants in relevant preparatory bodies of the Council (CODUN/CONOP/COARM etc.) will be able to consult the network on issues related to non-proliferation and conventional weapons, including SALW, and its representatives may attend the network\u2019s meetings. The network\u2019s meetings may be organised back to back with the working group meetings, if feasible.\nThe EU Non-Proliferation Consortium based on FRS, HSFK/PRIF, IISS and SIPRI will be entrusted with the management of the project, in close cooperation with the representative of the HR.\nThe EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, in consultation with the representative of the HR and Member States, will invite participants, specialised in non-proliferation and conventional weapons issues, to a kick-off meeting and an annual conference. Participants must demonstrate their expertise through a series of publications or other research activities in the field of non-proliferation of WMD and conventional weapons issues.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the projects\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 1: Organisation of a kick-off meeting and an annual conference with a report and/or recommendations\n3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the project\nThe objective of the kick-off meeting is to establish a European network of independent non-proliferation think tanks that are based in the Union. The kick-off meeting, chaired by the representative of the HR, will organise the network\u2019s activities and prepare an annual conference with a view to submitting a report and/or recommendations to the representative of the HR.\nThe annual, Carnegie-type of non-proliferation conference, with the participation of governmental experts and independent think tanks from the Union and third countries, would discuss and identify further measures to combat the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems and to address challenges related to conventional weapons, including countering the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition. The annual conference could be divided into thematic blocks and a concluding plenary session, chaired by the representative of the HR.\nOn the basis of the annual conference, a policy-oriented report will be produced together with a set of action-oriented recommendations to the representative of the HR. The report would be disseminated to the relevant institutions of the Union and the Member States and made available online.\n3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the project\n\u2014 establish a modus operandi for the European network of independent non-proliferation think tanks,\n\u2014 establish a major European non-proliferation conference that would become the key venue for promoting strategic discussion of measures to combat the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems and to address challenges related to conventional weapons, including countering the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition,\n\u2014 submit a policy-oriented report and/or action-oriented recommendations that would enhance the implementation of the EU WMD and SALW Strategies and constitute a useful stepping stone for non-proliferation and conventional weapons-related action by the Union and the international community,\n\u2014 increase the awareness and knowledge of the institutions of the Union, of Member States, civil society and third countries about threats related to WMD and their means of delivery, allowing them to improve anticipation.\n3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\nThe project provides for the organisation of two kick-off meetings, two annual meetings and the preparation of two reports and/or recommendations:\n\u2014 a kick-off meeting with the participation of up to 50 independent think tanks from the Union, specialised in non-proliferation and conventional weapons issues, including SALW,\n\u2014 a yearly conference with the participation of governmental experts and up to 200 independent think tanks from the Union and third countries, specialised in non-proliferation and conventional weapons issues, including SALW,\n\u2014 a policy oriented report and/or action-oriented recommendations that would boost the implementation of the EU WMD and SALW Strategies.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Project 2: Creation of an Internet platform\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purpose of the project\nThe establishment of an Internet website will facilitate intersessional contacts between the network meetings and foster research dialogue among the non-proliferation think tanks. The institutions of the Union and Member States could also benefit from a dedicated website where network participants are free to exchange information, share their ideas and to publish their studies on non-proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery and conventional weapons issues, including SALW. The website could be accompanied by an e-newsletter.\nThe project will provide an online follow-up to the events and a window for European research. It will contribute to efficient dissemination of research results among the think tank community and to governmental circles. This will lead to better anticipation and knowledge of threats linked to the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery, and conventional weapons, including the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition.\n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the project\n\u2014 establish a platform where non-proliferation think tanks can share their independent views and analysis on WMD proliferation and conventional weapons issues, including SALW,\n\u2014 promote a better understanding of the EU WMD and SALW Strategies within the civil society and serve as an interface between the Union and the network of think tanks,\n\u2014 allow the free download of documents from the network\u2019s meetings and from independent think tanks who may wish to share their research results without financial compensation,\n\u2014 increase awareness and knowledge of the institutions of the Union, the Member States, civil society and third countries about threats related to conventional weapons, WMD and their means of delivery, allowing them to improve anticipation.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the project\nThe use of a social network-service type of technology, when feasible and appropriate, could be explored in order to save costs and allow active online communication and information exchange between the network participants in a familiar environment. The EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, in charge of the project, would be responsible for webhosting, webdesign and technical maintenance of the website. The consortium could provide basic training to the representative of the HR and the relevant Council working parties on the website.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Duration\nThe total estimated duration of the implementation of the projects is 36 months.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beneficiaries\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Direct beneficiaries\nProliferation of WMD by both states and terrorists has been identified in the European Security Strategy and in the EU WMD Strategy as potentially the greatest threat to security of the Union. Similarly the EU SALW Strategy recognised that the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW and their ammunition poses a serious threat to international peace and security. The suggested projects serve the purposes of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and contribute to meeting the strategic objectives laid down in the European Security Strategy.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indirect beneficiaries\nThe indirect beneficiaries of the projects are:\n(a) independent think tanks specialised in non-proliferation and conventional weapons issues, including SALW, from the Union and third countries;\n(b) institutions of the Union;\n(c) Member States;\n(d) third countries.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third party participants\nThe projects will be financed in their entirety by this Decision. Experts from the network may be considered as third party participants. They will work in accordance with their standard rules.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedural aspects, coordination and the Steering Committee\nThe Steering Committee will be composed of a representative of the HR and of the implementing entity referred to in paragraph 8. The Steering Committee will review the implementation of the Council Decision regularly, at least once every 6 months, including by the use of electronic means of communication.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implementing entity\nTechnical implementation of this Council Decision will be entrusted to the EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, which will perform its task under the control of the HR. In carrying out its activities, the consortium will cooperate with the HR, the Member States, other State Parties, and international organisations as appropriate."}
