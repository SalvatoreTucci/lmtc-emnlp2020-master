That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase subtilisin and alpha-amylase as a feed additive for laying hens, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, subtilisin and alpha-amylase has been authorised for 10\u00a0years for chickens for fattening, for ducks, and for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1087/2009\u00a0(2).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 7 December 2010\u00a0(3) that the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, subtilisin and alpha-amylase, under the proposed conditions of use, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that that additive has the potential to improve egg parameter production in laying hens. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, subtilisin and alpha-amylase shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0297, 13.11.2009, p.\u00a04.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal (2011); 9(1):1949.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
