Although the authorisations under this Regulations are granted for a specified period, they may be withdrawn at any time in accordance with Article 9m and Article 11 of Directive 70/524/EEC. They may be withdrawn in particular in the light of the following: the Scientific Steering Committee has issued an opinion on antimicrobial resistance on 28 May 1999; a re-evaluation of the use of certain antibiotics as additives in feedingstuffs is currently being undertaken under Article 9g of Directive 70/524/EEC; the Kingdom of Sweden has prohibited the use on its territory of all antibiotics as additives in feedingstuffs on the basis of Article 11 of Directive 70/524/EEC. Moreover, the Commission is examining the data provided and the more general question of whether the use of antibiotics as additives in feedingstuffs meets the conditions set out in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for the authorisation of additives;\n(6) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Feedingstuffs,", "main_body": ["The provisional authorisations of the additives listed in the Annex I to this Regulation are replaced by authorisations granted to the person responsible for putting the additive in circulation, inserted in the second column of the Annex I.", "The provisional authorisations of the additives listed in Annex II to this Regulation are replaced by provisional authorisations granted to the person responsible for putting the additive into circulation, inserted in the second column of Annex II.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 297, 18.11.1999, p. 8.\n(3) OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 39.\nANNEX I\n>TABLE>\nANNEX II\n>TABLE>"}
