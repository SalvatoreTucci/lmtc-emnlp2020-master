When applying the calculation using the refractometric method to those products, they are found to have such a high level of sugar that they are considered to contain added sugar within the meaning of Additional note 3 to that Chapter although they do not contain any added sugar.\n(4) In order to ensure a correct classification of such products, it is therefore appropriate to provide for the use of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and for the application of an established formula already applied by the customs laboratories for the purposes of calculating the sugar content of those specific products falling under Chapter 20 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature.\n(5) In order to ensure uniform interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature throughout the Union with regard to measuring the sugar content of various products, point (a) of Additional note 2 to Chapter 20 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature should be amended.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 20 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, point (a) of Additional note 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) The content of various sugars expressed as sucrose (sugar content) of products classified in this Chapter corresponds to the figure indicated by a refractometer (used in accordance with the method prescribed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 974/2014) at a temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and multiplied by one of the following factors:\n\u2014 0,93 in respect of products of subheadings 2008\u00a020 to 2008\u00a080, 2008\u00a093, 2008\u00a097 and 2008\u00a099;\n\u2014 0,95 in respect of products of the other headings.\n\u2014 products manufactured on the basis of seaweed and other algae prepared or preserved by processes not provided for in Chapter 12;\n\u2014 products manufactured on the basis of manioc, arrowroot, salep, Jerusalem artichokes, sweet potatoes and similar roots and tubers with high starch or inulin content of heading 0714;\n\u2014 products manufactured on the basis of vine leaves;\n\u201cS\u201d is the sucrose content determined by the HPLC method;\n\u201cF\u201d is the fructose content determined by the HPLC method;\n\u201cG\u201d is the glucose content determined by the HPLC method.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2015.\nFor the Commission,\nOn behalf of the President,\nHeinz ZOUREK\nDirector-General for Taxation and Customs Union\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 974/2014 of 11 September 2014 laying down the refractometry method of measuring dry soluble residue in products processed from fruit and vegetables for the purposes of their classification in the Combined Nomenclature (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0274, 16.9.2014, p.\u00a06)."}
