Requirements to be met by operators and/or Member States carrying out investments in traceability projects were defined by the Commission in its letter of 14 May 2012.\n(6) On that basis and given budgetary constraints, requests in the programs for Union funding related to non-priority actions, such as installation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on board fishing vessels and those training projects having no link with improvements to be brought in the control systems of Member States, were rejected since they were not dedicated to the priority areas defined above.\n(7) As to traceability projects, it is important to ensure that they are developed on the basis of internationally recognised standards, as required by Article 67(8) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011\u00a0(3).\n(8) The Croatian application for Union funding has been assessed with regard to its compliance with the rules set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 391/2007 of 11 April 2007 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 as regards the expenditure incurred by Member States in implementing the monitoring and control systems applicable to the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(4).\n(9) In order to encourage investment in the priority actions defined by the Commission and in view of the negative impact of the financial crisis on Member States\u2019 budgets, expenditure related to the abovementioned priority areas and retained for this financing decision should benefit from a high co-financing rate, within the limits laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006.\n(10) In order to qualify for the contribution, automatic localisation devices should satisfy the requirements fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.\n(11) In order to qualify for the contribution, electronic recording and reporting devices on board fishing vessels should satisfy the requirements fixed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Decision provides for a Union financial contribution for 2013 towards expenditure incurred by Croatia in implementing the monitoring and control systems applicable to the common fisheries policy (CFP), as referred to in Article 8(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006.", "Closure of outstanding commitments\nAll payments in respect of which a reimbursement is claimed shall be made by Croatia by 30 June 2017.
