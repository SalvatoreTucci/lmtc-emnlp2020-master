Grading of pig carcases is carried out, by means of the apparatus called 'Hennessy grading probe` (HGP4):\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 mm diameter (and of 6,3 mm at the blade on top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO and photodetector of the type 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 mm. The results of the measurements shall be transformed in terms of estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself as well as a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 60,385 - 0,328 x1 - 0,456 x2 + 0,156 x3Where:\n^y = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measures at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase behind the last rib\nx2 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last rib\nx3 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres measured at the same time and the same place as x2.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 51 and 107 kg.\nPART 2\nIntrascope/Optical probe\n1. Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the method called 'Intrascope/Optical probe`.\n2. The intrascope shall be equipped with a hexagonal shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 mm (and of 19 mm at the blade on top of the probe) containing a viewing window and light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres and having an operating distance of between 7 and 50 mm.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 67,526 - 0,698 x1Where:\n^y = the estimated lean meat of the carcase\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres measures at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last rib.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 51 and 107 kg."}
