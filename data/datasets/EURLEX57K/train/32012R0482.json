It is a dioecious plant, i.e. each plant carries only female or only male flowers. Only \u2018female\u2019 plants are cultivated, forming flowers called burrs from which the cones later develop. The protection afforded by Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 is to apply only to female hop cones (fresh hops) and the products obtained by processing them (in this case, hop pellets and hop extract in particular). A hop cone consists of bracts, bracteoles and a strig providing the valuable brewing constituents of Tettnang hops. The hop is a short-day plant, i.e. it grows in the spring as the days get longer, and flowers from around 21 June when the days get shorter. Thanks to the favourable conditions in which they grow (soil, precipitation levels and average temperatures), Tettnang hops can reach heights of 8,3\u00a0m, unlike hops in other areas (support systems in other growing areas are normally 7-7,5\u00a0m in height). Tettnang hops are fast-growing (up to 30\u00a0cm a day) and climb in a clockwise direction. All aromatic varieties from the Tettnang region are defined as Tettnanger Hopfen. The varieties \u2018Hallertauer Tradition\u2019 and \u2018Perle\u2019 are grown in addition to the main varieties of \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 (since 1973 the uniform \u2018Tettnanger Fr\u00fchhopfen\u2019; P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p. 342). The \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 variety is grown only in the Tettnang region.\nUse: \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 hops are used almost exclusively (around 99\u00a0%) for producing beer, with a small portion going into pharmaceutical products. Customers receive \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 hops in processed form as hop pellets and, to a lesser extent, as hop extract (since valuable aromas can be lost during the extraction process).\nComponents: the important substances in hops are bitter substances (hop resins), aromas (essential oils) and tannins (polyphenols). Tettnang is defined as an area for the growing of aromatic varieties of hops.\nTettnang hops owe their worldwide reputation in particular to exceptionally delicate aromas, which are made up of over 300 essential oil constituents (the hop\u2019s \u2018bouquet\u2019). Descriptions of the aroma of Tettnang hops include flowery, citrusy, fruity, redcurrant-like, sweet and spicy. Hops grown in the Tettnang area are described as generally having a harmonious but lingering full and mild aroma.\nIn addition to this classification, the varieties are officially classified by the hop trade as \u2018finest aroma, aroma, bitter hops, high alpha hops\u2019. 96\u00a0% of Tettnang hops (the varieties Tettnanger and Hallertauer) are in the category \u2018finest aroma\u2019; the remaining 4\u00a0% (Perle and Hallertauer Tradition) are in the category \u2018aroma\u2019. Since many of the 300 aromatic components are not yet sensorily detectable, it is still the subjective impression of the aroma that counts for the breweries\u2019 decision-makers and buyers (when making his selection the buyer puts his nose in among the hops). Those knowledgeable in this field say that the Tettnang hop is the finest of all hops.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe entire hop production process until the moment the hop cones are packaged by the hop growers and sealed and certified at the local sealing centre takes place in the defined geographical area.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2014\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\n\u2014\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe geographical area is the Tettnang region. This includes:\n1. the municipalities of Eriskirch, Friedrichshafen, Hagnau am Bodensee, Immenstaad am Bodensee, Kressbronn am Bodensee, Langenargen, Markdorf, Meckenbeuren, Neukirch, Oberteuringen and Tettnang in the Lake Constance district (Bodenseekreis);\n2. the municipalities of Achberg, Amtzell, Berg, Bodnegg, Gr\u00fcnkraut, Ravensburg, Wangen im Allg\u00e4u (area of the former municipalities of Neuravensburg and Schomburg) in the rural district of Ravensburg; and\n3. the municipalities of Bodolz, Lindau (Bodensee), Nonnenhorn and Wasserburg (Bodensee) in the rural district of Lindau (Bodensee).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe first official record of hop-growing in the Tettnang region dates back to 1150 (P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p 12). The records for 1838 of the then Oberamt Tettnang give the names of 14 breweries (see Memminger\u2019s \u2018Beschreibung des Oberamts Tettnang\u2019, 1838, p. 62), three of which were for the town. Three years later, in 1841, this number had risen to six (P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p. 13). Their owners grew their hops themselves. The methodical cultivation of hops was introduced in 1844 by district physician Johann Nepomuk von Lentz and eight citizens of the town in an area where climatic conditions made wine-growing less feasible (P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p. 15). From 1860 onwards, the hop-growing area expanded, meeting with the older growing region of Altshausen to the north (where hops had been cultivated from around 1821; P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p. 14). In 1864, 91\u00a0ha were cultivated; this figure rose to 160\u00a0ha in 1866, 400\u00a0ha in 1875, and 630\u00a0ha in 1914; (P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, p. 22 et seq.). The hop-growing region around Tettnang saw its most significant expansion in the 1990s, when the area cultivated increased to 1\u00a0650 hectares (1997 EU hop market report, 1997 HVG producer group report). In the Tettnang region only aromatic hops were selected and grown.\nTettnang hops are grown only on the gravel of the lower terraces formed from the late-moraine till of the W\u00fcrm glaciation in the Schussen basin, along the River Argen and its ice-age banks. This geological formation with underlying groundwater currents enables the hops to grow roots up to 2\u00a0m deep. At the same time, it provides the hops with a constant source of moisture even during periods of extreme drought. The temperate climate here between 400 and 600\u00a0m above mean sea level and influenced in part by Lake Constance is another important factor determining the aroma of Tettnang hops.\nTettnang hops are grown in climatic conditions (average annual temperatures, hours of sunshine, precipitation) which are unique. With a temperature of 9,4\u00a0\u00b0C, almost 1\u00a0800 hours of sunshine and 1\u00a0136\u00a0mm of rain, the average figures recorded during the last 30 years (2009 data) are much higher than those in other growing regions in Germany.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nAll aromatic varieties from the Tettnang region are defined as Tettnanger Hopfen. The varieties \u2018Hallertauer Tradition\u2019 and \u2018Perle\u2019 are grown in addition to the main varieties of \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 and \u2018Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher\u2019. The \u2018Tettnanger\u2019 variety is grown only in the Tettnang region.\nTettnanger Hopfen contain exceptionally delicate aromas which are made up of over 300 essential oil constituents (the hop \u2018bouquet\u2019). Descriptions of the aroma of Tettnang hops include flowery, citrusy, fruity, redcurrant-like, sweet and spicy. Hops grown in the Tettnang area are described as generally having a harmonious but lingering full and mild aroma.\n96\u00a0% of Tettnang hops (the varieties Tettnanger and Hallertauer) are in the hop trade category \u2018finest aroma\u2019; the remaining 4\u00a0% (Perle and Hallertauer Tradition) are in the category \u2018aroma\u2019.\nTettnanger Hopfen are also characterised by a high level of homogeneity.\nThis is proven by the annual external quality examination of hop batches delivered to Tettnang\u2019s hop laboratory.\nFor the Tettnanger variety this was also confirmed by Hohenheim University and for the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher variety by the Anheuser/Busch brewery.\nTettnang hops have a reputation which extends well beyond regional boundaries. The delicate aroma of the hops from Tettnang has enamoured connoisseurs in Japan and the USA alike. One example of the respect and association with quality enjoyed by Tettnang hops can be found in the USA, where it is not rare for brewers to put a label on their kegs stating that the contents have been \u2018Brewed with Tettnang Hops\u2019. The quality of Tettnang hops means that they always attract the highest selling prices (EU annual reports in the 1990s, annual reports from 1990 to 2000 of the Bayerische Landesanstalt; P. Heidtmann, \u2018Gr\u00fcnes Gold\u2019, 1994, pp. 368 and 369). The lives of the citizens of Tettnang revolve around hops, a fact borne out by the regional structures and events which focus on Tettnang hops. The Tettnang Hop Museum, which opened its doors in 1995, bears witness to the town\u2019s fascination with hop-growing. A 4\u00a0km educational trail tells interested visitors all they need to know about Tettnang hops. A 42\u00a0km circular path takes cyclists through the Tettnang hop-growing region. Every year in August, shortly before the harvest, the citizens of Tettnang come together to celebrate the long tradition of their \u2018green gold\u2019 at the Hop Festival in Tettnang-Kau. And finally, every two years the Tettnang Hop Highnesses are elected (one Hop Queen and two Princesses) as ambassadors for Tettnang hops at home and abroad.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe combination of these geological and climatic factors provides optimum conditions for Tettnang hops to grow and produce cones, and ensures a homogeneity which is to a large extent due to geographical factors. In addition, the soil conditions in the defined geographical area and the fairly mild climate, partly due to the influence of Lake Constance, play a major role in determining the particularly fine aroma of Tettnanger Hopfen. It is this aroma which is instrumental in its global renown. The long tradition of hop cultivation in the Tettnang region also means that the local population strongly identifies with Tettnanger Hopfen and make it part of their cultural life.\nReference to publication of the specification\nMarkenblatt Vol. 33 of 20.8.2010, Part 7a-bb, p. 14729\nhttp://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/geo/detail.pdfdownload/19450"}
