As a supplementary measure the Italian authorities also requested approval for a vaccination programme against avian influenza for at least 18 months in order to avoid the further spread of infection.\n(3) The vaccination programme was approved by Commission Decision 2002/975/EC(6), which laid down the rules concerning vaccination against avian influenza in an area described in the Annex. The Decision also includes specific control measures such as movement restrictions on live poultry, hatching and table eggs for intra-Community trade.\n(4) Further experience suggests amending the approved vaccination programme in order to include possible vaccination of breeding poultry and to modify the vaccination schemes applied to different categories of poultry, in particular to layers. Restrictions on keeping certain categories of poultry above a defined age limit should be reviewed taking into account the favourable epidemiological evolution in the prevalence of avian influenza infections in those populations.\n(5) Restrictions on intra-Community trade currently in place for products sourced from holdings located within a defined radius around a holding infected with low pathogenic avian influenza should be reviewed and lifted subject to certain precautionary measures being implemented.\n(6) The \"discriminatory test\" (iIFA test) approved by Commission Decision 2001/847/EC(7) for its use in turkeys has now been further developed and its application in other poultry species, in particular in chickens, should provide the necessary animal health guarantees for intra-Community trade in fresh meat derived from vaccinated chickens.\n(7) The occurrence of avian influenza infections with virus of low pathogenicity has considerably decreased in the last few months; however it appears appropriate to prolong the vaccination programme for a further six months protecting the population against a re-introduction of the infection.\n(8) Decision 2002/975/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(9) Furthermore the opportunity should be taken to repeal Commission Decisions 2000/149/EC(8), 2003/153/EC(9), 2003/359/EC(10) and 2003/428/EC(11), taken in relation to outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza that had occurred in Italy in 2000 and in the Netherlands and Belgium in 2003, and which are no longer applicable.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The amendments requested by Italy to the vaccination programme approved by Decision 2002/975/EC concerning in particular:\n(a) the possibility of vaccinating breeding poultry;\n(b) the modification of vaccination schemes for different categories of poultry according to their immune status, in particular in layers;\n(c) the modification of the monitoring programme for poultry originating from the vaccination area;\n(d) the use of an additional heterologous vaccine containing the strain A/ck/Italy/1067/1999/H7N1;\n(e) the prolongation of the life span for certain categories of poultry; and\n(f) the prolongation of the vaccination programme for six months (24 months in total),\nare hereby approved.", "Decision 2002/975/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
