The Commission has asked the Member State which acted as rapporteur for azinphos-methyl under Council Directive 91/414/EEC\u00a0(5), to make a proposal for the review of Community MRLs. Such a proposal was submitted to the Commission.\n(2) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number of Codex MRLs for azinphos-methyl. The Community MRLs based on Codex MRLs have also been evaluated by the Rapporteur Member State in the light of the new information on the risks for the consumers.\n(3) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the azinphos-methyl via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(6). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.\n(4) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.\n(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community\u2019s trading partners have been informed about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels will be taken into account.\n(7) Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC the entry relating to azinphos-methyl is deleted.", "Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.", "Directive 86/363/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.", "Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 18 March 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
