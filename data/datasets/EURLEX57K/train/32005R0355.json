The International Vine and Wine Office (OIV) adopted the new description of this method at its General Assembly in 2000.\n(2) Use of this measurement method can constitute a simpler and more accurate means of checking the alcoholic strength by volume of wines.\n(3) There is no longer any need to recognise the equivalence of this method with the methods described in Chapter 3 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90\u00a0(2), and Article 3(2) of that Regulation should therefore be deleted. The updated description of this method and the experimental values for the validation parameters for the method should also be included in Chapter 3 of the Annex to that Regulation.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
