The following paragraph 3 is added to Article 2:\n'3. The tetrachloroethylene content of olive oil and of olive-pomace oil shall be determined by the method set out in Annex X. However, until 31 October 1989 Member States may decide that the tetrachloroethylene content can be determined by other methods giving results which are compatible with the standard method. The Member States concerned shall communicate to the Commission those other methods before using them. If the tetrachloroethylene content determined by another method differs from that determined by the standard Community method, the content determined by the standard method shall apply.'\n3. The following line is added in the Table of Annexes:\n'Annex X Tetrachloroethylene content 26'\n4.

Gas chromatography apparatus fitted with an electron capture detector (ECD).\n2. Head space.\n3. Gas chromatography column, of glass, 2 metres long and 2 mm in diameter, stationary phase.\nOV101 10 % or equivalent, impregnating a calcined diatomaceous earth, acid washed and silamized and of a particle size of 80 to 100 mesh.\n4. Carrier and auxiliary gas: nitrogen for gas chromatography, suitable for detection by electron capture.\n5. Glass flasks, 10 to 15 ml, with teflon coating and aluminium stopper with fitment for entry of syringe.\n6. Hermetically sealing clamps.\n7. Gas syringe 0,5 to 2 ml.\nReagents\nStandard: - tetrachloroethylene of a degree of purity suitable for gas chromatography,\n- pentane of a degree of purity suitable for gas chromatography.\nProcedure\n1. Exactly weigh around 3 g of oil in a glass flask (not to be reused), hermetically seal it. Place it in a thermostat at 70 \uc9f8C for one hour. Using a syringe carefully remove 0,2 to 0,5 ml of the head space. Inject this into the column of the gas chromatography apparatus regulated as follows:\n- injector temperature 150 \uc9f8C\n- column temperature: 70 to 80 \uc9f8C\ndetector temperature: 200 to 250 \uc9f8C\nOther temperatures may also be used provided the results remain equivalent.\n2. Reference solutions. Prepare standard solutions using refined olive oil with no trace of solvents with tetrachloroethylene concentrations ranging from 0,05 to 1 mg/kg and corresponding to the presumed content of the sample. The tetrachloroethylene may be diluted using pentane.\n3. Quantitative assessment. Correlate the surfaces or the elevations of the peaks of the sample and of the standard solution of the concentration presumed closest. If the deviation is greater than 10 % the analysis must be repeated in comparison with another standard solution until the deviation is within 10 %. The tetrachloroethylene content is determined on the basis of the average of the elementary injections.\n4. Expression of results: in mg/kg (ppm). The detection limit for the method is 0,01 mg/kg."}
