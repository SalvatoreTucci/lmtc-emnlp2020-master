whereas, furthermore, measures must be introduced to enable the Community to keep  check upon the conditions of issue of the said certificate; whereas accordingly certain obligations  should be imposed on the issuing authority;\nWhereas the certificate of authenticity should be drawn up in an official Community language and,  where appropriate, an official language of the exporting country;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are\nin accordance with the opinion of the  Nomenclature Committee,", "main_body": ["1.

Other colours and combinations of colours frequently  result from variations in maturity of cultural and curing techniques;\n(b)  light air-cured Burley type tobacco (including Burley hybrids) means tobacco which has been  cured under natural atmospheric conditions and does not carry the odour of smoke or fumes if  supplemental heat or air circulation has been applied; the leaves normally range from light tan to  reddish colour. Other colours and\ncombinations of colours frequently result from variations in  maturity or cultural and curing techniques;\n(c)  light air-cured Maryland type tobacco means tobacco which has been cured under natural  atmospheric conditions and does not carry the odour of smoke or fumes if supplemental heat or air  circulation has been applied; the leaves normally range from a light-yellow to deep cherry red  colour.
