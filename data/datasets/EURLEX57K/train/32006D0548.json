The function of DSA may be carried out by the NSA;\n(e) \u201cFacility Security Clearance (FSC)\u201d: an administrative determination by a NSA/DSA that, from the security viewpoint, a facility can afford adequate security protection to EU classified information of a specific security classification level and that its personnel who require access to EU classified information have been appropriately security cleared and briefed on the necessary security requirements for accessing and protecting EU classified information;\n(f) \u201cIndustrial or other entity\u201d: a contractor or a subcontractor involved in supplying goods, executing works or providing services; this may involve industrial, commercial, service, scientific, research, educational or development entities;\n(g) \u201cIndustrial security\u201d: the application of protective measures and procedures to prevent, detect and recover from the loss or compromise of EU classified information handled by a contractor or subcontractor in (pre)contract negotiations and classified contracts;\n(h) \u201cNational Security Authority (NSA)\u201d: the Government Authority of an EU Member State with ultimate responsibility for the protection of EU classified information within that Member State;\n(i) \u201cOverall level of security classification of a contract\u201d: determination of the security classification of the whole contract or grant agreement, based on the classification of information and/or material that is to be, or may be, generated, released or accessed under any element of the overall contract or grant agreement. The overall level of security classification of a contract may not be lower than the highest classification of any of its elements, but may be higher because of the aggregation effect;\n(j) \u201cSecurity Aspects Letter (SAL)\u201d: a set of special contractual conditions, issued by the contracting authority, which forms an integral part of a classified contract involving access to or generation of EU classified information, and that identifies the security requirements or those elements of the classified contract requiring security protection;\n(k) \u201cSecurity Classification Guide (SCG)\u201d: a document which describes the elements of a programme, contract or grant agreement which are classified, specifying the applicable security classification levels. The SCG may be expanded throughout the life of the programme, contract or grant agreement, and the elements of information may be re-classified or downgraded. The SCG must be part of the SAL.\n27.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Organisation\n(a) The Commission may confer by classified contract tasks involving, entailing and/or containing EU classified information on industrial or other entities registered in a Member State;\n(b) The Commission shall ensure that all requirements deriving from these minimum standards are complied with when awarding classified contracts;\n(c) The Commission shall involve the relevant NSA or NSAs in order to apply these minimum standards on industrial security. NSAs may refer these tasks to one or more DSAs;\n(d) The ultimate responsibility for protecting EU classified information within industrial or other entities rests with the management of these entities;\n(e) Whenever a classified contract or subcontract falling within the scope of these minimum standards is awarded, the Commission and/or the NSA/DSA, as appropriate, will promptly notify the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the contractor or subcontractor is registered.\n27.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Classified contracts and grant decisions\n(a) The security classification of contracts or grant agreements must take account of the following principles:\n\u2014 the Commission determines, as appropriate, those aspects of the classified contract which require protection and the consequent security classification; in so doing, it must take into account the original security classification assigned by the originator to information generated before awarding the classified contract,\n\u2014 the overall level of classification of the contract may not be lower than the highest classification of any of its elements,\n\u2014 EU classified information generated under contractual activities is classified in agreement with the Security Classification Guide,\n\u2014 where appropriate, the Commission is responsible for changing the overall level of classification of the contract, or security classification of any of its elements, in consultation with its originator, and for informing all interested parties,\n\u2014 classified information released to the contractor or subcontractor or generated under contractual activity must not be used for purposes other than those defined by the classified contract and must not be disclosed to third parties without the prior written consent of the originator;\n(b) The Commission and NSAs/DSAs of the relevant Member States are responsible for ensuring that contractors and subcontractors awarded classified contracts which involve information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above take all appropriate measures for safeguarding such EU classified information released to or generated by them in the performance of the classified contract in accordance with national laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the security requirements may result in termination of the classified contract;\n(c) All industrial or other entities participating in classified contracts which involve access to information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above must hold a national FSC. The FSC is granted by the NSA/DSA of the Member State to confirm that a facility can afford and guarantee adequate security protection of EU classified information to the appropriate classification level;\n(d) When a classified contract is awarded, a Facility Security Officer (FSO), appointed by the management of the contractor or subcontractor, shall be responsible for requesting a Personnel Security Clearance (PSC) for all persons employed in industrial or other entities registered in an EU Member State whose duties require access to information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above subject to a classified contract, to be granted by the NSA/DSA of that Member State in accordance with its national regulations;\n(e) Classified contracts must include the SAL as defined in 27.2.(j). The SAL must contain the SCG;\n(f) Before initiating a negotiated procedure for a classified contract the Commission will contact the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the industrial or other entities concerned are registered in order to obtain confirmation that they hold a valid FSC appropriate to the level of security classification of the contract;\n(g) The contracting authority must not place a classified contract with a preferred economic operator before having received the valid FSC certificate;\n(h) Unless required by Member State national laws and regulations, an FSC is not required for contracts involving information classified RESTREINT UE;\n(i) Invitations to tender in respect of classified contracts must contain a provision requiring that an economic operator who fails to submit a tender or who is not selected be required to return all documents within a specified period of time;\n(j) It may be necessary for contractors to negotiate classified subcontracts with subcontractors at various levels. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that all subcontracting activities are undertaken in accordance with the common minimum standards contained in this Section. However, the contractor must not transmit EU classified information or material to a subcontractor without the prior written consent of the originator;\n(k) The conditions under which a contractor may subcontract must be defined in the tender or call for proposals and in the classified contract. No subcontract may be awarded to entities registered in a non-EU Member State without the express written authorisation of the Commission;\n(l) Throughout the life of the classified contract, compliance with all its security provisions will be monitored by the Commission, in conjunction with the relevant DSA/NSA. Any security incidents shall be reported, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Part II, Section 24 of these Rules on Security. Any change to or withdrawal of an FSC shall immediately be communicated to the Commission and to any other NSA/DSA to which it has been notified;\n(m) When a classified contract or a classified subcontract is terminated, the Commission and/or the NSA/DSA, as appropriate, will promptly notify the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the contractor or subcontractor is registered;\n(n) The common minimum standards contained in this Section shall continue to be complied with, and the confidentiality of classified information shall be maintained by the contractors and subcontractors, after termination or conclusion of the classified contract or classified subcontract;\n(o) Specific provisions for the disposal of classified information at the end of the classified contract will be laid down in the SAL or in other relevant provisions identifying security requirements;\n(p) The obligations and conditions referred to in this Section apply mutatis mutandis to procedures where grants are awarded by decision and notably to the beneficiaries of such grants. The grant decision shall set out all obligations of the beneficiaries.\n27.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visits\nVisits by personnel of the Commission in the context of classified contracts to industrial or other entities in the Member States performing EU classified contracts must be arranged with the relevant NSA/DSA. Visits by employees of industrial or other entities within the framework of an EU classified contract must be arranged between the NSAs/DSAs concerned. However, the NSAs/DSAs involved in an EU classified contract may agree on a procedure whereby visits by employees of industrial or other entities can be arranged directly.\n27.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transmission and transportation of EU classified information\n(a) With regard to the transmission of EU classified information, the provisions of Part II, Section 21 of these Rules on Security shall apply. In order to supplement such provisions, any existing procedures in force among Member States will apply;\n(b) The international transportation of EU classified material relating to classified contracts will be in accordance with Member State's national procedures. The following principles will be applied when examining security arrangements for international transportation:\n\u2014 security is assured at all stages during the transportation and under all circumstances, from the point of origin to the ultimate destination,\n\u2014 the degree of protection accorded to a consignment is determined by the highest classification of material contained within it,\n\u2014 an FSC is obtained, where appropriate, for companies providing transportation. In such cases, personnel handling the consignment must be security cleared in compliance with the common minimum standards contained in this Section,\n\u2014 journeys are point to point to the extent possible, and are completed as quickly as circumstances permit,\n\u2014 whenever possible, routes should be only through EU Member States. Routes through non-EU Member States should only be undertaken when authorised by the NSA/DSA of the States of both the consignor and the consignee,\n\u2014 prior to any movement of EU classified material, a Transportation Plan is made up by the consignor and approved by the NSAs/DSAs concerned.\u2019"}
