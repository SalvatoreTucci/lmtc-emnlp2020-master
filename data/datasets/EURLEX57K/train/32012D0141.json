It is one of the diseases listed in Annex I to Decision 2009/470/EC.\n(3) No case of rabies has been detected in Greece since 1987. However, following recent detection of that disease in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is necessary that rabies surveillance in northern Greece is urgently reinforced in order to define whether that disease is spreading to the territory of that Member State and to which extent there is a need for oral immunisation of wild carnivores in order to stop the spread and eradicate that disease.\n(4) On 27 January 2012, Greece submitted to the Commission an emergency plan for the reinforced surveillance of rabies (\u2018the plan\u2019). The Commission has assessed the plan and found it to be acceptable. It is therefore appropriate that certain measures under that plan receive a Union financial contribution.\n(5) Greece has informed the Commission of the lack of personnel in its national reference laboratory for rabies in order to carry out the increased number of tests required to implement the plan. Given the current unfavourable financial situation and the urgency to set up and implement the plan, it is appropriate that the cost for laboratory staff specifically hired for carrying laboratory tests under the plan should be included in the costs eligible for a Union financial contribution.\n(6) Taking into account the urgency to implement the plan, it is justified that the Union financial contribution is made available for measures taken from 27 January 2012 when the plan was submitted to the Commission for financing.\n(7) This Decision constitutes a financing Decision within the meaning of Article 75 of the Financial Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The \u2018Emergency plan for the surveillance of rabies\u2019 submitted by Greece to the Commission on 27 January 2012 (\u2018the plan\u2019) is hereby approved for the grant of a Union financial contribution for the period from 27 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 (\u2018the financial contribution\u2019).", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution shall not exceed, in total, EUR 60\u00a0000.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution shall include a lump sum of EUR 5 per wild animal collected and sent for rabies investigation under the plan.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution shall be at the rate of 75\u00a0% of the costs to be incurred under the plan for the laboratory tests for the detection of rabies infection and for the isolation and characterisation of rabies virus.\nThose costs shall include:\n(a) the costs paid for the purchase of test kits, reagents and all consumables used to carry out the laboratory tests;\n(b) overheads equal to 7\u00a0% of the total sum of the costs referred to in point (a).\nHowever, the maximum amount of the costs to be reimbursed for a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) shall not exceed, in total, EUR 12 per test.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution shall be at the rate of 75\u00a0% of the costs for personnel specifically hired for carrying out the laboratory tests referred to in paragraph 3.\nThose costs shall include:\n(a) the fee paid for the personnel or their actual salaries plus social security charges and other statutory costs included in their remuneration;\n(b) overheads equal to 7\u00a0% of the total sum of the costs referred to in point (a).\nHowever, the maximum amount of the costs to be reimbursed for such personnel shall not exceed, in total, EUR 25\u00a0000.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial contribution shall be granted provided that Greece:\n(a) implements the plan in accordance with the relevant provisions of Union law, including rules on competition, the award of public contracts and State aid;\n(b) submits interim technical reports to the Commission in accordance with Annex I by the latest on:\n(i) 31 May 2012, covering the period from 27 January 2012 to 30 April 2012;\n(ii) 30 September 2012, covering the period from 1 May 2012 to 31 August 2012;\n(c) submits a final technical report and a financial report in accordance with Annexes I and II, covering the period from 27 January 2012 to 31 December 2012, by the latest on 28 February 2013;\n(d) implements satisfactorily the measures foreseen in the plan.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that Greece does not comply with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, the Commission shall reduce the financial contribution taking into account the nature and gravity of the non-compliance and the financial loss incurred by the Union.", "This Decision shall apply from 27 January 2012.", "This Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 March 2012.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\nANNEX I\nThe technical reports referred to in Article 3(1)(b) and (c) shall include at least the following information:\nReporting period: from _ to _.
