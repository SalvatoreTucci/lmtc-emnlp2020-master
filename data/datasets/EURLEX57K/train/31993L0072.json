A list of the chemical elements, arranged  according to atomic number, is shown in Table A. Organic substances, because of their variety, have  been placed in the usual classes, as shown in Table B.\nThe index number for each substance is in the form of a digit sequence of the type: ABC - RST - VW  - Y, where ABC is either the atomic number of the most characteristic chemical element (preceded by one or two  zeros to make up the sequence) or the usual class number for organic substances;\nRST is the consecutive number of the substance in the series ABC;\nVW denotes the form in which the substance is produced or placed on the market; and Y is the check-digit calculated in accordance with the ISBN (International Standard Book Number)  method.\nAs an example, the index number for sodium chlorate is 017-005-00-9.\nFor dangerous substances in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances  (Einecs, OJ No C 146A, 15. 6. 1990) the Einecs number is included. This number is a seven-digit  system of the type XXX-XXX-X which starts at 200-001-8.\nFor dangerous substances notified under the provisions of Directive 67/548/EEC, the number of the  substance in the European List of Notified Substances (Elincs) is included. This number is a  seven-digit system of the type XXX-XXX-X which starts at 400-010-9.\nThe Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number is also included to assist identification of the entry.  It should be noted that the Einecs number includes both anhydrous and hydrated forms of a  substance, whilst there are frequently different CAS numbers for anhydrous and hydrated forms. The  CAS number included in all cases is for the anhydrous form only, and therefore the CAS number shown  does not always describe the entry as accurately as the Einecs number.\nEinecs, Elincs or CAS numbers are not usually included for entries which comprise more than three  individual substances.\nThe structure of well defined substances is also shown to assist in the identification of the  substance.\nNomenclature\nWherever possible dangerous substances are designated by their Einecs or Elincs  names. Other entries not listed in Einecs or Elincs are designated using an internationally  recognized chemical name (e.g. ISO, IUPAC). An additional common name is included in some cases.\nImpurities, additives and minor components are normally not mentioned unless they contribute  significantly to the classification of the substance.\nSome substances are described as a 'mixture of A and B`. These entries refer to one specific  mixture. In some cases where it is necessary to characterize the substance put on the market, the  proportions of the main substances in the mixture are specified.\nSome substances are described with a specific percentage purity. Substances containing a higher  content of active material (e.  g. an organic peroxide) are not included in the Annex I entry and  may have other hazardous properties (e.  g. explosive). Where specific concentration limits are  shown, these apply to the substance or substances shown in the entry. In particular, in the case of  entries which are mixtures of substances or substances described with a specific percentage purity,  the limits apply to the substance as described in Annex I and not the pure substance.\nFormat of entries\nThe following information is given for each substance in Annex I:\n(a)  the classification:\n(i)  classification consists of placing a substance in a category of danger as defined in Article  2.2 of Directive 67/548/EEC and assigning the qualifying risk phrase(s). The classification has  consequences not only for labelling but also other legislation and regulatory measures on dangerous  substances;\n(ii)  the classification in each category of danger is shown in separate boxes. Each box includes,  in general, a description of the category of danger and a qualifying risk phrase(s). However in  some cases (i.  e. substances classified as flammable, sensitizing and some substances classified  as dangerous for the environment) only the risk phrase(s) appears as this gives sufficient  information;\n(iii)  the description of the categories of danger is shown below:\nExplosive: E\nOxidizing: O\nExtremely Flammable: F+\nHighly Flammable: F\nFlammable: R10\nVery Toxic: T+\nToxic: T\nHarmful: Xn\nCorrosive: C\nIrritant: Xi\nSensitizing: R42 and/or R43\nCarcinogenic: Carc. Cat.  (1)\nMutagenic: Mut. Cat.  (1)\nReproductive toxin: Repr. Cat.  (1)\nDangerous for the Environment: N or R52, R53, R59;\n(iv)  additional risk phrases which have been assigned to describe other properties (see sections  2.2.6 and 3.2.8 of the labelling guide) are shown in separate boxes;\n(b)  the label, including:\n(i)  the symbol(s), if allocated, and indications of danger assigned to the substance in accordance  with Annex II (see Article 23 (2) (c));\n(ii)  the risk phrases, denoted as a series of numbers preceded by the letter R indicating the  nature of the special risks, in accordance with Annex III (see Article 23 (2) (d)). The numbers are  separated by either:\na dash (-) to denote separate statements concerning special risks (R); or an oblique stroke (/) to denote a combined statement, in a single sentence, of the special risks as  set out in Annex III;\n(iii)  the safety phrases denoted as a series of numbers preceded by the letter S indicating the  recommended safety precautions, in accordance with Annex IV (see Article 23 (2) (e)). Again the  numbers are separated by either a dash or an oblique stroke, the significance of which is as in  (ii) above, except that the combined statements of recommended safety precautions are set out in  Annex IV. The safety phrases shown apply only to substances; for preparations, phrases are selected  according to the usual rules.\nNote that for certain dangerous substances and preparations sold to the general public certain  S-phrases are mandatory.\nS  1, S  2 and S  45 are obligatory for all very toxic, toxic and corrosive substances and  preparations sold to the general public.\nTABLA A - TABEL A - TABELLE A - \u00d0\u00c9\u00cd\u00c1\u00ca\u00c1\u00d3 \u00c1 - TABLE A - TABLEAU A - TABELLA A - TABEL A -  TABELA A\nLista de los elementos qu\u00edmicos clasificados por su n\u00famero at\u00f3mico  (Z)\nListe over  grundstoffer, ordnet efter deres atomvaegt  (Z)\nListe der chemischen Elemente, geordnet nach der  Ordnungszahl  (Z)\n\u00ca\u00e1\u00f4UE\u00eb\u00ef\u00e3\u00ef\u00f2 \u00f7\u00e7\u00ec\u00e9\u00ea\u00fe\u00ed \u00f3\u00f4\u00ef\u00e9\u00f7aass\u00f9\u00ed \u00f4\u00e1\u00ee\u00e9\u00ed\u00ef\u00ec\u00e7\u00ec\u00dd\u00ed\u00f9\u00ed \u00f3\u00fd\u00ecoe\u00f9\u00ed\u00e1 \u00ecaa \u00f4\u00ef\u00ed \u00e1\u00f4\u00ef\u00ec\u00e9\u00eaue \u00f4\u00ef\u00f5\u00f2 \u00e1\u00f1\u00e9\u00e8\u00ecue   (AE)\nList of chemical elements listed according to their atomic number  (Z)\nListe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments  chimiques class\u00e9s selon leur num\u00e9ro atomique  (Z)\nElenco degli elementi chimici ordinati secondo  il loro numero atomico  (Z)\nLijst van chemische elementen, gerangschikt naar atoomgewicht  (Z)\nLista dos elementos qu\u00edmicos ordenados segundo o seu n\u00famero at\u00f3mico  (Z)\n>TABLE>\nTABEL B - TABELA B\nClasificaci\u00f3n especial para las sustancias org\u00e1nicas\nSaerlig inddeling af  organiske stoffer\nSpezielle Anordnung fuer die organischen Stoffe\nAA\u00e9ae\u00e9\u00ea\u00de \u00f4\u00e1\u00ee\u00e9\u00edue\u00ec\u00e7\u00f3\u00e7 \u00f4\u00f9\u00ed  \u00ef\u00f1\u00e3\u00e1\u00ed\u00e9\u00ea\u00fe\u00ed \u00ef\u00f5\u00f3\u00e9\u00fe\u00ed\nSpecial classification for organic substances\nClassification particuli\u00e8re aux  substances organiques\nClassificazione speciale per le sostanze organiche\nSpeciale indeling voor  de organische stoffen\nClassifica\u00e7\u00e3o especial para as subst\u00e2ncias org\u00e2nicas\n>TABLE>\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>"}
