Toltrazuril is also included in Annex III to that Regulation for bovine species for muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals from which milk is produced for human consumption, awaiting completion of scientific studies. Those studies have now been completed and toltrazuril should therefore be extended in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 to include bovines. The entry should also be extended to all mammalian food-producing species for muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals from which milk is produced for human consumption and to poultry for muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney excluding animals from which eggs are produced for human consumption.\n(3) The substance diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is included in Annex II for bovine and porcine species. The entry for diethylene glycol monoethyl ether should be extended to include all ruminants.\n(4) The substance polysorbate 80 is included in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for all food-producing species. That entry should be replaced by the general name polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, covering both polysorbate 80 and polysorbate 81 for all food-producing species.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products\u00a0(2) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 8 April 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.
