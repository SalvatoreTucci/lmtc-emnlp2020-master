The additional duties referred to in Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 shall be applied to molasses falling within CN codes 1703 10 00 and 1703 90 00.\n2. For the purposes of this Regulation, representative prices for molasses on the world market or on the Community import market as referred to in Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 shall mean the cif prices for those products established and fixed by the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.\nThese prices shall normally be fixed every week in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81. They shall be applicable until a subsequent fixing enters into force.\n3. When the Commission is unable to establish a representative price specific to beet molasses falling within CN code 1703 90 00 for a particular week because of lack of information on the purchase possibilities for this type of molasses, the specific representative price previously in force shall continue to apply.\nHowever, this representative price shall not apply for a period of more than four weeks. After that, the representative price for beet molasses falling within CN code 1703 90 00 shall be established on the basis of the representative price in force for cane molasses under CN code 1703 10 00 plus a flat rate of ECU 0,30 per 100 kilograms, taking account of the trigger price for beet molasses.", "For 100 kilograms of molasses of the standard quality referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the trigger price referred to in Article 15 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 shall be equivalent to:\n(a) ECU 7,90 for molasses falling within CN code 1703 10 00;\n(b) ECU 8,20 for molasses falling within CN code 1703 90 00.", "1.

This amount shall be fixed at the same time as the representative prices referred to in Article 1 (2).\nHowever, where there is a risk that suspension of import duties may have adverse effects on the Community market in molasses, provision may be made for not applying that suspension for a specific period in accordance with the same procedure.", "1.
