Method of using standard gross margins (base period \"1980\")    (1) The SGMs set out in C are used in the context of the Community typology for agricultural holdings to determine the type of farming and the size class appropriate to each holding considered.\n(2) The SGMs which are applied to each holding are those for the region in which the holding is situated.\n(3) The SGMs relating to crops are used to multiply the appropriate crop area expressed in hectares.\n(4) The application of the SGMs for fodder crops (D/12 : forage roots and tubers, D/18 : forage plants, F/01 : pasture and meadow and F/02 : rough grazings) is as follows:      (a) The SGMs of fodder crops are normally zero, the variable costs of fodder being deducted when calculating the SGMs of grazing livestock.\n(b) If there are no grazing livestock on the holding, fodder crops are treated in the same way as other crops. The appropriate SGM given under C is applied.\nThis provision applies also in the case of Dutch holdings when the ratio between the SGM for fodder crops and the SGM for grazing livestock (J/01 to J/10) is higher than 3 and, in the case of French holdings, higher than 1.\n(c)  >PIC FILE= \"T0026452\">\n(d) For these two countries, the existence of a fodder surplus, or of a fodder deficit in the case of Danish holdings, is determined as follows:\nThe relationship between grazing livestock and fodder crops is established by weighting the numbers of livestock on each holding according to the weights set out in table 1 below and the areas of fodder crops by the weights set out in table 2 below.\nThe resulting weighted grazing livestock figure is then divided by the weighted figure for the fodder crops ; the ratio (R) derived from this calculation is then compared with a lower threshold (3) and, in the case of Danish holdings, with an upper threshold (4). If R is above the lower threshold and, for Denmark, below the upper threshold, the situation is considered \"normal\" and fodder crops are not taken into account when calculating the standard gross margin of the holding. If, on the other hand, R is below the lower threshold or, for Denmark, is above the upper threshold, there is a surplus or deficit of fodder and the following procedures are applied:  - In the case of a surplus of fodder, only a part of the SGM for all fodder crops is taken into account. This part (x) is calculated according to the following formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0025836\">\nwhere : a = 0,5 in Denmark and 2,5 (national average) in Belgium.\nThe result is allocated to the different types of farming as indicated in Annex II (B) and added to the SGMs for the other enterprises in order to determine the SGMs of the holding.\nIn this it is assumed that fodder crops have been used by the holding's livestock in the following order of priority:\nF/01 : pasture and meadow, F/02 : rough grazings, D/18a : temporary grass, D/18b : other fodder plants and D/12 : forage roots and tubers.\nExample (Denmark) : If R is 0,4, the part to be taken into account is: >PIC FILE= \"T0025924\">\nIf the SGM for fodder crops on the holding is : D/12 = 500, D/18 = 6 000, F/01 + F/02 = 3 500 (total = 10 000), then 1/5 of 10 000, i.e. 2 000, is added to the SGM of the holding according to the following division : 500 for D/12 then the balance, i.e. 1 500 for D/18.  >PIC FILE= \"T0025925\">\n(3) Lower threshold = 0,5. (4) Upper threshold = 1,7.   - In the case of Danish holdings with a fodder deficit the SGM for each category of grazing livestock on such holdings is reduced according to the following formula: >PIC FILE= \"T0025837\">\nFor category J/07 (dairy cows), the normal SGM being 634 and the SGM from table 3 being 416, the SGM to be applied in the case of this holding for this category of livestock is:\n634 - 0,43 (634 - 416) = 540\n(5) The SGMs relating to livestock are used to multiply the appropriate number of animals, expressed in terms of heads (for poultry (J 14, J/15, J/16) in terms of 100 head). Piglets (J/11) are taken into account only when no breeding sows (J/12) are on the holding.\n(6) The SGMs given in table 3 below apply to grazing livestock on Danish and French holdings which do not produce fodder (D/12 + D/18 + F/01 + F/02 = 0) (1).\n(7) When for a given holding the area of each crop on the one hand and the number of heads for each category of livestock on the other hand have been converted into SGMs using the procedure set out above, two operations allow the holding to be classified, i.e.:      - the addition of the SGM for each enterprise in order to obtain the total SGMs of the holding, this criterion being used to determine its size,\n- the division of each of the SGMs for the different principal and/or particular types by the total SGMs of the holding in order to determine its type of farming.  (1) This provision applies also to French holdings where the ratio between the SGM for fodder and the SGM for grazing livestock (J/01 to J/10) is below 0,1.\nTABLE 1 WEIGHTING FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRAZING LIVESTOCK\n>PIC FILE= \"T0025838\">\nTABLE 2 WEIGHTING FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF FODDER CROPS\n>PIC FILE= \"T0025926\">\nTABLE 3 STANDARD GROSS MARGINS FOR GRAZING LIVESTOCK TO BE APPLIED WHEN NO FODDER IS GROWN ON THE HOLDING\n>PIC FILE= \"T0025927\">\nPART 2\nThe following shall be added to Annex II (C) to Commission Decision 78/463/EEC:\n\"2.
