That additive was notified as an existing product in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Since all the information required under that provision was submitted, that additive was entered into the Community Register of Feed Additives.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the holder of the authorisation and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.

The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(4) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the trade name Actisaf, it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisations.\n(5) Regulations (EC) No 1447/2006, (EC) No 186/2007, (EC) No 188/2007 and (EC) No 209/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1447/2006, in column 3, the trade name \u2018Biosaf Sc 47\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Actisaf\u2019.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 186/2007, in column 3, the trade name \u2018Biosaf Sc 47\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Actisaf\u2019.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 188/2007, in column 3, the trade name \u2018Biosaf Sc 47\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Actisaf\u2019.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 209/2008, in column 3, the trade name \u2018Biosaf Sc 47\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Actisaf\u2019.", "Existing stocks which are in conformity with the provisions applying before the date of entry into force of this Regulation may continue to be placed on the market and used until six months after that date.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 September 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 271, 30.9.2006, p. 28.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 63, 1.3.2007, p. 6.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 57, 24.2.2007, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 63, 7.3.2008, p. 3."}
