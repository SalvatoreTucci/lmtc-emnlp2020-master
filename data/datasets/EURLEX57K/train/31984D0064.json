Commission Decision of 27 January 1984 authorizing Greece to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of cigarettes\n", "header": "COMMISSION  DECISION\nof 27 January 1984\nauthorizing Greece to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of cigarettes\n(84/64/EEC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN\nCOMMUNITIES", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Article 130 thereof,\nWhereas, by Decisions 83/41/EEC (1) and 83/94/EEC (2), the Commission authorized Greece to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of certain products;\nWhereas, by letter of 30 December 1983, the Greek Government applied to the Commission for authorization to adopt, pursuant to Article 130 of the Act of Accession of Greece, additional protective measures in certain sectors;\nWhereas the Greek authorities have provided the Commission with information enabling the latter to establish that serious difficulties are persisting in certain sectors which were the subject of the protective measures referred to in the abovementioned Decisions;\nWhereas, by Decision 84/38/EEC (3), Greece was authorized by the Commission to adopt additional protective measures in certain sectors, by continuing to limit in the sectors concerned imports of products originating in or coming from the other Member States and to monitor imports of products from non-member countries, for a further period of 10 months;\nWhereas the Greek authorities had provided information enabling the Commission to establish that serious difficulties were persisting and that it was necessary to continue limiting imports in the cigarette sector in order to enable the restructuring process to continue;\nWhereas on 11 January 1984 the Commission did not, however, have sufficient data to determine the limits to be applied in this sector for the period in question; whereas the Commission nevertheless stated that it would take a decision to that effect by 1 February 1984;\nWhereas, in order to determine these limits, the Commission authorized Greece, by Decision 84/38/EEC, to monitor imports of cigarettes from all countries;\nWhereas the Commission is now in possession of sufficient data to enable it to determine the limits that should be applied in this sector;\nWhereas imports of cigarettes originating in or coming from the Member States can be estimated at approximately 1 250 tonnes in 1983;\nWhereas the shift in demand in the cigarette sector towards American-type cigarettes requires not only an improvement in product quality, which is being achieved with the cooperation of foreign firms, but also a reorganization of agricultural production, which traditionally concentrated an oriental tobacco, a type currently less adapted to consumer tastes;\nWhereas the volume of imports in this sector constitutes a source of difficulties that are particularly serious since the employment situation in this sector continues to give grounds for concern;\nWhereas the sector in question still presents certain structural deficiencies such that an immediate return to a liberalized system could jeopardize the rationalization process that has been initiated;\nWhereas it appears appropriate to limit imports of cigarettes originating in or coming from the Member States for a further period of 10 months in order to continue the process of improving and restoring the balance of the situation in this sector with a view to adjusting to Community competition;\nWhereas these measures to limit imports must be accompanied by a system for monitoring imports of cigarettes coming from non-member countries;\nWhereas the provisions adopted must under no circumstances result in imports in this sector being limited to a level below that of imports actually carried out during the corresponding period in 1983;\nWhereas, should the quantities representing the limits fixed by the Commission in the abovementioned Decisions not have been used up, the Greek authorities must issue import documents in respect of the quantities unused in addition to the amounts covered by this Decision;\nWhereas, to achieve an equitable distribution of the authorized quantities both among the Member States and among the operators concerned, Greece must respect existing patterns of trade;\nWhereas the proper application of the provisions of this Decision requires the establishment of highly specific implementation and management rules;\nWhereas the Commission should keep a permanent check on the data relating to the sector in question and reserves the right to amend upwards the quantities given herein, and to amend or repeal this Decision;\nWhereas, in the light of the examination that the Commission has conducted of the economic difficulties in the sector concerned, the limits adopted constitute measures which, while enabling the desired result to be obtained, disturb the functioning of the common market as little as possible,", "main_body": ["Greece is hereby authorized under the conditions specified below, to limit or monitor imports of cigarettes until
