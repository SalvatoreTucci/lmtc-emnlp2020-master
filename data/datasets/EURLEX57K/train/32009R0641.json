The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the Community and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.\n(4) Circulators consume much of the energy used in heating systems in buildings. Furthermore, most standard circulators operate continuously, regardless of heating needs. Circulators are therefore one of the priority products for which ecodesign requirements should be established.\n(5) The environmental aspect of circulators that is identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation is electricity consumption in the use phase.\n(6) The preparatory study shows that approximately 14 million circulators are placed on the Community market annually and that their most significant environmental impact out of all life-cycle phases is the use phase energy consumption amounting to 50 TWh in 2005, corresponding to 23 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. If no specific measures are taken, electricity consumption is predicted to increase to 55 TWh by 2020. The preparatory study shows that use phase electricity consumption can be significantly improved.\n(7) The preparatory study shows that requirements regarding other ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1, of Directive 2005/32/EC are not necessary as power consumption of circulators in use phase is by far the most important environmental aspect.\n(8) Circulators should be made more efficient by applying existing non-proprietary cost-effective technologies that can reduce the total combined costs of purchasing and operating circulators.\n(9) Ecodesign requirements should harmonise electricity consumption requirements for circulators throughout the Community, thus contributing to the functioning of the internal market and to improving the environmental performance of these products.\n(10) To increase the re-use and recycling of circulators, manufacturers should provide information on the assembly and dismantling of circulators.\n(11) The ecodesign requirements should not have a negative impact on the functionality of circulators and should not negatively affect health, safety or the environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing electricity consumption during the use phase should more than offset any additional environmental impacts during the production phase.\n(12) The ecodesign requirements should be introduced gradually in order to provide a sufficient timeframe for manufacturers to re-design products subject to this Regulation as appropriate. The timing for the introduction of these requirements should be such as to avoid negative impacts on the functionalities of circulators on the market, and to take into account cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring timely achievement of the objectives of the Regulation.\n(13) Conformity assessment and measurements of the relevant product parameters should be performed using reliable, accurate and reproducible measurement methods, which take into account the generally recognised state of the art measurement methods including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies, as listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services\u00a0(2).\n(14) This Regulation should quickly ensure the placing on the market of technologies that reduce the life-cycle environmental impact of circulators, leading to estimated electricity savings of 23 TWh by 2020, corresponding to 11 Mt of CO2 equivalent, compared with the situation, where no action is taken.\n(15) In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2005/32/EC, this Regulation should specify the applicable conformity assessment procedures.\n(16) In order to facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers should provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(17) In addition to the legally binding requirements laid down in this Regulation, indicative benchmarks for best available technologies should be identified to ensure wide availability and easy accessibility of information on the life-cycle environmental performance of circulators.\n(18) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2005/32/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation establishes ecodesign requirements for the placing on the market of glandless standalone circulators and glandless circulators integrated in products.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation shall not apply to:\n(a) drinking water circulators, except as regards information requirements of Annex I, point 2(4);\n(b) circulators integrated in products and placed on the market not later than 1 January 2020 as replacement for identical circulators integrated in products and placed on the market no later than 1 August 2015.

Where a circulator has more than one setting of head and flow, measure the circulator at the maximum setting.\n2. Find the point where \nQ \u0387 H\n is maximum and define the flow and head at this point as: Q100\u00a0%\n and H100\u00a0%\n.\n3. Calculate the hydraulic power Phyd\n at this point.\n4. Calculate the reference power as:\n5. Define the reference control curve as the straight line between the points:\n6. Select a setting of the circulator ensuring that the circulator on the selected curve reaches \nQ \u0387 H\n = max point.\n7. Measure P1\n and H at the flows:\n8. Calculate at these flows\n9. Using PL\n and this load profile:\nFlow Time\n100 6\n75 15\n50 35\n25 44\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0CXX\u00a0% means a scaling factor that ensures that at the time of defining the scaling factor only XX\u00a0% of circulators of a certain type have an EEI \u2264 0,20.\nANNEX III\nVERIFICATION PROCEDURE\nFor the purposes of checking conformity with the requirements laid down in Annex I, the authorities of the Member States shall use the measurement and calculation procedure set out in Annex II.\nMember States authorities shall test a single circulator. If the energy efficiency index exceeds the values declared by the manufacturer by more than 7\u00a0%, the measurements shall be made on three more circulators. The model shall be considered to comply if the arithmetical mean of the measured values for the latter three circulators do not exceed the values declared by the manufacturer by more than 7\u00a0%.\nOtherwise, the model shall be considered not to comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\nIn addition to the procedure set out in this Annex, Member States authorities shall use reliable, accurate and reproducible measurement methods, which take into account the generally recognised state of the art, including methods set out in documents the reference numbers of which have been published for that purpose in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nANNEX IV\nINDICATIVE BENCHMARKS\nAt the time of the adoption of this Regulation, the benchmark for the best available technology on the market for circulators is EEI \u2264 0,20."}
