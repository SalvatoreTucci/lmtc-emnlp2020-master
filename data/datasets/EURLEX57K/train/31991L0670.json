This definition also includes ratings associated with the document;\n(b) rating means a statement entered on a licence, or in a separate document, setting forth special  conditions, privileges or limitations pertaining to such licence;\n(c) acceptance of licences means any act of recognition or validation by a Member State of a  licence issued by another Member State together with the privileges and certificates pertaining  thereto. The acceptance, which may be effected through the issue by the Member State of a licence  of its own, shall not extend beyond the period of validity of the original licence;\n(d) recognition means the permission to use on an aircraft registered in one Member State a licence  issued in another Member State, in accordance with the privileges pertaining thereto;\n(e) validation means the express declaration by a Member State that a licence issued by another  Member State can be used as one of its own;\n(f) cockpit personnel means personnel holding a licence and charged with duties essential to the  operation of an aircraft during flight time.

This recognition shall be limited to the exercise of  the privileges of the holder of a private pilot's licence and of associated aircraft ratings under  visual flight rules (VFR) by day only in an aircraft certificated for single-pilot operations.", "1.  Article 3 (1) shall apply where a licence issued by a Member State and presented to  another Member State for acceptance is based on requirements which are equivalent to those of the  host Member State. In order to enable the competent authorities to assess the equivalence of  licences issued by other Member States, the Commission shall make, and forward to all the Member  States before 1 January 1992, a comparison of the requirements applied in each Member State for  issuing licences for the same functions.\n2. (a) Any Member State may ask the Commission for an opinion on the equivalence of a licence,  presented to it for acceptance, within three weeks of receiving the request.\n(b) The Commission must deliver an opinion within two months. The Member State concerned shall then  have a month to reply to the applicant.\n(c) If a Member State does not ask the Commission for an opinion, it shall be bound to reply to the  applicant within three months.\n(d) The periods referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above shall start to run when all the necessary  information is available.\n3.  If, after the examination of a licence by the Member State to which it has been presented for  acceptance, reasonable doubts remain as to the equivalence of the licence concerned, that Member  State may, notwithstanding the principles laid down in Article 3 (1), consider that additional  requirements and/or tests are necessary to enable the licence to be accepted. The licence holder,  the Member State which issued the licence and the Commission shall be informed thereof in writing.  The opportunity to take an additional test shall be given to the licence holder by the host Member  State to which the licence is submitted for approval as soon as possible, and in any event without  discrimination on grounds of nationality.\n4.  Where the applicant has met the additional requirements and/or has passed the required test(s)  as laid down in paragraph 3 the Member State concerned shall forthwith accept the licence in  question.\n5.  Notwithstanding the above, with respect to pilot's licences and notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to  4, a Member State shall accept any licence issued in accordance with the requirements of Annex 1 to  the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation if the bearer satisfies the special  validation requirements laid down in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall ensure that nationals of other Member States are admitted to public  and private training establishments and to licensing examinations and procedures on the same basis  as applies to their own nationals.", "When a Member State issues, for reasons of equivalence, a licence on the basis of a  licence issued by a third country together with the privileges and certificates pertaining thereto,  this shall be recorded in the licence.

After consulting the Commission, Member States shall bring into force the laws,  regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 June  1992.
