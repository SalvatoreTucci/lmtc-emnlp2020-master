In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the issuance of euro coins.\n(3) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro\u00a0(5), coins denominated in euro and cent and complying with the denominations and technical specifications laid down by the Council have the status of legal tender in all Member States whose currency is the euro. Denominations and technical specifications of euro coins are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a0975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation\u00a0(6).\n(4) Member States whose currency is the euro should also be able to issue 2-euro commemorative coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and per issuing Member State for the number of issues of such coins. It is necessary to establish certain volume limits for commemorative euro coins in order to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the total number of the 2-euro coins in circulation. Such volume limits should, however, allow for the issuance of a sufficient volume of coins to ensure that commemorative euro coins can circulate effectively.\n(5) Member States whose currency is the euro should also be able to issue euro collector coins, which are not intended for circulation and which should be readily distinguishable from circulation coins. Euro collector coins should have the status of legal tender only in the Member State of issuance and should not be issued with a view to their entry into circulation.\n(6) It is appropriate that issuances of euro collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank, but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue.\n(7) The use of different denominations of euro coins and euro banknotes, as currently devised, should be periodically and carefully examined by the competent institutions against the criteria of cost and public acceptability. In particular, the Commission should conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1- and 2-cent coins.\n(8) In order to avoid that fit euro circulation coins are destroyed by one Member State while there may be a need of such coins in another, Member States should consult each other prior to the destruction of such coins,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018circulation coins\u2019 means euro coins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications of which are laid down in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0975/98;\n(2) \u2018commemorative coins\u2019 means circulation coins, which are intended to commemorate a specific subject as specified in Article 1h of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0975/98;\n(3) \u2018collector coins\u2019 means euro coins intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.", "Types of euro coin\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1- and 2-cent coins.
