Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus \"Fully automatic ultrasonic carcase grading\" (Autofom).\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 16 ultrasonic transducers, operating at 2 MHz (SFK Technology, K2KG - 67080) with a distance of 25 mm between each transducer.\nThe ultrasonic data cover three major parts of the carcases and comprise fat thicknesses and muscle depth. The remaining parameters are related to the above parameters.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central data-processing unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 57,5151291 + 0,8717916 T01 + 0,7625082 T02 + 1,3110994 T03\nwhere:\n^y = the estimated lean meat in the carcase\nT01, T02 and T03 = principal component variables, calculated on the basis of 127 individual measuring points.\n4. The description of the measurement points and the description of the statistical method are laid down in the German Protocol, Part II, submitted to the Commission under the terms of Article 3 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms.`"}
