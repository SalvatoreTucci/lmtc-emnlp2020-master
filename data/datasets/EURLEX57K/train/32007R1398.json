The Interim Agreement on trade and trade related matters will enter into force on 1 January 2008. The Interim Agreement will allow the trade provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to apply provisionally pending its ratification. Therefore, the Republic of Montenegro should be removed from the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 from the date of implementation of the Interim Agreement.\n(2) After the removal of all components of the former Yugoslavia from the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 517/94, Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999\u00a0(2) is the only territory in the region subject to textile quotas. Therefore and in view of the lack of textile industry, it is considered appropriate that Kosovo is also excluded from the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 in order to avoid any discrimination against this territory.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee established by Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, III B and VI to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 are replaced as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2007.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 67, 10.3.1994, p. 1.
