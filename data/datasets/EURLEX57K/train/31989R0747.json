If, between the date on which an application is lodged for an export licence with advance fixing of the refund and the date on which the product is exported there is a change in the intervention price for white sugar expressed in ecus in respect of non-deficit areas the export refund in question shall be adjusted in accordance with the conditions set out below.\n2.
