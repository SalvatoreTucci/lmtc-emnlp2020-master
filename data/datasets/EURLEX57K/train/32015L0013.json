The revised EN 14154 standard reflects the international standard. It is more exigent in relation to the flowrate range than the specific requirements set out in Annex III to Directive 2014/32/EU and results in more precise measurements.\n(4) Prior to the introduction of the flowrate range Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a010 by means of Directive 2004/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) on measuring instruments, the international OIML standard which already contained a requirement for the flowrate range of Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a040 was applied in all Member States. As a result of the transitional provisions provided for in Article 50(2) of Directive 2014/32/EU, most of the water meters currently placed on the market are already in conformity with the requirement of Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a040.\n(5) Water meters with the flowrate range Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a010 may be significantly cheaper than those meeting the requirements of the standard EN 14154 (Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a040). Directive 2014/32/EU, in point 10 of Annex III thereto, gives discretion to the utility or the person legally designated for installing the water meter to determine, inter alia, what level of flowrate range is appropriate for the accurate measurement of consumption that is foreseen or foreseeable\u00a0(3). Therefore, water meters not conforming to the standard EN 14154 for flowrate range but in line with the requirements set out in Annex III to Directive 2014/32/EU may be installed. This may, however, increase the possibility of customers having errors in bills resulting from the less precise measurement of the meter.\n(6) The flowrate range of Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a040 represents the state of the art embodied in the current international standard and manufacturing practice, as well as the minimum quality available at present on the Union market. It provides for more precise measurements thereby ensuring a higher level of protection of consumers. Given that the flowrate range of Q3/Q1 \u2265\u00a040 has for many years been and still is the minimum being installed by the market, compliance does not involve additional costs for users.\n(7) Directive 2014/32/EU should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Annex III to Directive 2014/32/EU, point 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.
