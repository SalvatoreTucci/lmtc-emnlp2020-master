The object of this Directive, drawn up pursuant to Article 2 (2)  of Directive 75/442/EEC, is to approximate the laws of the Member States on the controlled  management of hazardous waste.\n2.  Subject ot this Directive, Directive 75/442/EEC shall apply to hazardous waste.\n3.  The definition of 'waste` and of the other terms used in this Directive shall be those in  Directive 75/442/EEC.\n4.  For the purpose of this Directive 'hazardous waste` means:\n- wastes featuring on a list to be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article  18 of Directive 75/442/EEC on the basis of Annexes I and II to this Directive, not later than six  months before the date of implementation of this Directive. These wastes must have one or more of  the properties listed in Annex III. The list shall take into account the origin and composition of  the waste and, where necessary, limit values of concentration. This list shall be periodically  reviewed and if necessary by the same procedure,\n- any other waste which is considered by a Member State to display any of the properties listed in  Annex III. Such cases shall be notified to the Commission and reviewed in accordance with the  procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC with a view to adaptation of the list.\n5.  Domestic waste shall be exempted from the provisions of this Directive. The Council shall  establish, upon a proposal from the Commission, specific rules taking into consideration the  particular nature of domestic waste not later than the end of 1992.", "1.  Member States shall take the necessary measures to require that on every site where  tipping (discharge) of hazardous waste takes place the waste is recorded and identified.\n2.  Member States shall take the necessary measures to require that establishment and undertaking  which dispose of, recover, collect or transport hazardous waste do not mix different categories of  hazardous waste or mix hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste.\n3.  By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the mixing of hazardous waste with other hazardous waste  or with other waste, substances or materials may be permitted only where the conditions laid down  in Article 4 of Directive 75/442/EEC are complied with and in particular for the purpose of  improving safety during disposal or recovery. Such an operation shall be subject to the permit  requirement imposed in Articles 9, 10 and 11 of Directive 75/442/EEC.\n4.  Where waste is already mixed with other waste, substances or materials, separation must be  effected, where technically and economically feasible, and where necessary in order to comply with  Article 4 of Directive 75/442/EEC.", "1.  The derogation referred to in Article 11 (1) (a) of Directive 75/442/EEC from the  permit requirement for establishments or undertakings which carry out their own waste disposal  shall not apply to hazardous waste covered by this Directive.\n2.  In accordance with Article 11 (1) (b) of Directive 75/442/EEC, a Member State may waive Article  10 of that Directive for establishments or undertakings which recover waste covered by this  Directive:\n- if the Member State adopts general rules listing the type and quantity of waste and laying down  specific conditions (limit values for the content of hazardous substances in the waste, emission  limit values, type of activity) and other necessary requirements for carrying out different forms  of recovery, and - if the types or quantities of waste and methods of recovery are such that the conditions laid  down in Article 4 of Directive 75/442/EEC are complied with.\n3.  The establishments or undertankings referred to in paragraph 2 shall be registered with the  competent authorities.\n4.  If a Member State intends to make use of the provisions of paragraph 2, the rules referred to  in that paragraph shall be sent to the Commission not later than three months prior to their coming  into force. The Commission shall consult the Member States. In the light of these consultations the  Commission shall propose that the rules be finally agreed upon in accordance with the procedure  laid down in Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC.", "1.  Article 13 of Directive 75/442/EEC shall also apply to producers of hazardous  waste.\n2.  Article 14 of Directive 75/442/EEC shall also apply to producers of hazardous waste and to all  establishments and undertakings transporting hazardous waste.\n3.  The records referred to in Article 14 of Directive 75/442/EEC must be preserved for at least  three years except in the case of establishments and undertakings transporting hazardous waste  which must keep such records for at least 12 months. Documentary evidence that the management  operations have been carried out must be supplied at the request of the competent authorities or of  a previous holder.", "1.  Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, in the course of  collection, transport and temporary storage, waste is properly packaged and labelled in accordance  with the international and Community standards in force.\n2.  In the case of hazardous waste, inspections concerning collection and transport operations made  on the basis of Article 13 of Directive 75/442/EEC shall cover more particularly the origin and  destination of such waste.\n3.  Where hazardous waste is transferred, it shall be accompanied by an identification form  containing the details specified in Section A of Annex I to Council Directive 84/631/EEC of 6  December 1984 on the supervision and control within the European Community of the transfrontier  shipment of hazardous waste (1), as last amended by Directive 86/279/EEC (2).", "1.

They shall forthwith  inform the Comission thereof.\n2.  When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or  shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods  of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.\n3.  Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national  law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.", "1\nDirective 78/319/EEC is hereby repealed with effect from 12 December 1993.", "2\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 December 1991.\nFor the CouncilThe PresidentJ.G.M.

Attribution of the hazard properties 'toxic` (and 'very toxic`),  'harmful`, 'corrosive` and 'irritant` is made on the basis of the criteria laid down by Annex VI,  part I A and part II B, of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 of the approximation of  laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and  labelling of dangerous substances (1), in the version as amended by Council Directive 79/831/EEC  (2).\n2. With regard to attribution of the properties 'carcinogenic`, 'teratogenic` and 'mutagenic`, and  reflecting the most recent findings, additional criteria are contained in the Guide to the  classification and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations of Annex VI (part II D) to  Directive 67/548/EEC in the version as amended by Commission Directive 83/467/EEC (1).\nTest methods\nThe test methods serve to give specific meaning to the definitions  given in Annex III.\nThe methods to be used are those described in Annex V to Directive 67/548/EEC, in the version as  amended by Commission Directive 84/449/EEC (2), or by subsequent Commission Directives adapting  Directive 67/548/EEC to technical progress. These methods are themselves based on the work and  recommendations of the competent international bodies, in particular the OECD.\n(1)OJ N\u00b0 L 196, 16. 8. 1967, p. 1.\n(2)OJ N\u00b0 L 259, 15. 10. 1979, p. 10.\n(1)OJ N\u00b0 L 257, 16. 9. 1983, p. 1.\n(2)OJ N\u00b0 L 251, 19. 9. 1984, p. 1."}
