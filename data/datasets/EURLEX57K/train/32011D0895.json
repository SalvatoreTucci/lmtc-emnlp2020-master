The difference between the taxation of locally produced products and the taxation of other products may not exceed 5, 15 or 25\u00a0%, depending on the product.\n(2) It is justified to extend the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC for two years, since the basic elements justifying the authorisation provided under that Decision have remained unchanged. In this regard, the report from the Commission to the Council of 28 August 2008 on the application of the special arrangements concerning the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands confirmed that the AIEM tax was functioning in a satisfactory manner and without the need for any amendments to Decision 2002/546/EC.\n(3) Moreover, the report received by the Commission from the Spanish authorities confirms that the handicaps that justified the authorisation of total exemptions and partial reductions of the AIEM tax to a list of products produced locally in the Canary Islands are still valid.\n(4) Decision 2002/546/EC should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In the first sentence of Article 1(1) of Decision 2002/546/EC, the date \u201831 December 2011\u2019 is replaced by that of \u201831 December 2013\u2019.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
