whereas these criteria are to be appropriately weighted in the allocation of resources;\nWhereas Article 12 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 stipulates that for the period 1994 to 1999, 9 % of the commitment appropriations from the Structural Funds shall be devoted to funding assistance undertaken on the initiative of the Commission in  accordance with Article 5 (5) of that Regulation;\nWhereas Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (5), stipulates that a limited part of the appropriations available for Community initiatives under Objectives 1, 2 and 5 (b) may cover areas other  than those referred to in Articles 8, 9 and 11a of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;\nWhereas such appropriations may not have the effect of reducing the amounts allocated under Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 to the regions eligible under Objective 1;\nWhereas it is therefore appropriate to set aside less than 9 % of Objective 1 resources for Community initiatives;\nWhereas, therefore, the indicative allocation of resources by Member State in the Objective 1 Community support frameworks, expressed in 1994 prices, should amount to ECU 93,81 billion, comprising ECU 59,88 billion for the four Member States covered by  the cohesion financial instrument and ECU 33,93 billion for the other regions eligible under Objective 1,", "main_body": ["The indicative allocation between Member States pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 12 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 in respect of the resources to be devoted to the Community support frameworks for Objective 1 as defined in  the said Regulation shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 October 1993.\nFor the Commission\nBruce MILLAN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 185, 15. 7. 1988, p. 9.\n(2) OJ No L 193, 31. 7. 1993, p. 5.\n(3) OJ No L 79, 1. 4. 1993, p. 74.\n(4) OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1988, p. 1.\n(5) OJ No L 193, 31. 7. 1993, p. 20.\nANNEX\nINDICATIVE ALLOCATION BETWEEN MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMITMENT APPROPRIATIONS OF THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS AND THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT FOR FISHERIES GUIDANCE (FIFG) IN RESPECT OF THE OBJECTIVE 1 COMMUNITY SUPPORT FRAMEWORKS   1994 to 1999  (in ECU billion, at 1994 prices)\n\"\" ID=\"01\">Greece> ID=\"02\">13,98\"> ID=\"01\">Spain> ID=\"02\">26,30\"> ID=\"01\">Ireland> ID=\"02\">5,62\"> ID=\"01\">Portugal> ID=\"02\">13,98 \"> ID=\"01\">Total > ID=\"02\">59,88 \">\n\"\" ID=\"01\">Belgium> ID=\"02\">0,73\"> ID=\"01\">Germany> ID=\"02\">13,64\"> ID=\"01\">France> ID=\"02\">2,19\"> ID=\"01\">Italy> ID=\"02\">14,86\"> ID=\"01\">The Netherlands> ID=\"02\">0,15\"> ID=\"01\">United Kingdom> ID=\"02\">2,36 \"> ID=\"01\">Total > ID=\"02\">33,93  \">"}
