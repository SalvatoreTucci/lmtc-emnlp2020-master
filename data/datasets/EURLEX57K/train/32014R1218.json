It provides that consignments of ungulates are to be introduced into the Union only, if they comply with certain requirements and they are accompanied by the appropriate veterinary certificate, drawn up in accordance with the relevant model set out in that Regulation.\n(2) The model veterinary certificates for imports into the Union of domestic porcine animals for breeding and/or production, and for immediate slaughter are set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as respectively models \u2018POR-X\u2019 and \u2018POR-Y\u2019. Those models do not include guarantees for Trichinella.\n(3) The model veterinary certificate for imports into the Union of fresh meat of domestic porcine animals is set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as model \u2018POR\u2019. That model includes guarantees for Trichinella.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005\u00a0(5) lays down rules for the sampling of carcases of species susceptible to Trichinella infection and for the determination of the status of holdings keeping domestic swine.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EU) No 216/2014\u00a0(6) amending Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 grants derogation from testing provisions at slaughter to holdings which are officially recognised as applying controlled housing conditions. In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1114/2014\u00a0(7) lays down that a holding where domestic swine are kept, can only be recognised as applying controlled housing conditions if, inter alia, the food business operator introduces new domestic swine onto this holding only if they originate in and come from other holdings also officially recognised as applying controlled housing conditions.\n(6) The model veterinary certificates \u2018POR-X\u2019 and \u2018POR-Y\u2019 set out in Annex I and the model certificate \u2018POR\u2019 set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should be amended to reflect the requirements relating to imports of domestic porcine animals and fresh meat thereof laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005, as amended by Regulation (EU) No 216/2014. In particular, information on the official recognition of the holding of provenance of domestic swine should be respectively included or amended in the model certificates in order to enable Member States to apply the appropriate Trichinella testing regime at slaughter, not to jeopardize the status of the holding of destination of domestic swine for breeding and/or production and to ensure the safety of the fresh meat.\n(7) An official veterinarian should include supplementary guarantees and specific conditions in relation to controlled housing conditions as regards Trichinella in the model veterinary certificates \u2018POR-X\u2019, \u2018POR-Y\u2019 and \u2018POR\u2019.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) To avoid any disruption of imports into the Union of consignments of domestic porcine animals and of fresh meat thereof, the use of certificates issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 in their versions prior to the amendments being introduced by this Regulation should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) the following entry is added to Specific Conditions in
