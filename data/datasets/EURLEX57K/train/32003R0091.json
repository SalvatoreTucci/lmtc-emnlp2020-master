Such standards should be implemented in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of producing official statistics.\n(9) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(6) provides a reference framework for the provisions laid down by this Regulation.\n(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).\n(11) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities(8) has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of the said Decision,", "main_body": ["Objective\nThe objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the production of Community rail transport statistics.", "Scope\nThis Regulation shall cover all railways in the Community.
