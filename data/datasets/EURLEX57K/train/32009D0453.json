According to the complainant this withdrawal was prompted by changed circumstances.\n(9) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(10) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any consideration showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest.

However, no comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of sodium, in bulk, originating in the USA should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of sodium, in bulk, falling within CN code ex\u00a02805\u00a011\u00a000, originating in the United States of America, is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nCatherine ASHTON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a056, 6.3.1996, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0186, 23.7.2008, p.\u00a032.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0186, 23.7.2008, p.\u00a035.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See page 74 of this Official Journal."}
