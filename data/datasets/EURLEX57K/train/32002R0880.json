That Annex includes in particular items subject to control in the context of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Wassenaar Arrangement.\n(3) The political commitments made by the Member States in the context of the NSG or the Wassenaar Arrangement must be applied in strict compliance with the principles established by Community law, particularly the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. Both Treaties establish the principle of the free movement of goods within the Community, and dual-use items are subject to this principle.\n(4) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 constitutes an exception to the principle of the free movement within the Community of dual-use items. This exception arises from the political commitments made by the Member States and the sensitivity of the items concerned.\n(5) Since some of the items are less sensitive in terms of proliferation, control of their transfer within the Community under Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 does not seem justified.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
