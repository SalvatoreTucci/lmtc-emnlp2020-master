Furthermore, it is acknowledged that the principles of Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 of 28 June 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting(3), which obliges credit and other institutions to withdraw from circulation banknotes which they know or have sufficient reason to believe to be counterfeit, apply by analogy also to NCBs. Nevertheless, it is deemed necessary, for the purposes of clarity, to expressly mention in the context of this Decision that NCBs are obliged to withhold against acknowledgement of receipt all mutilated or damaged banknotes in connection with which they know or have sufficient reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, whether counterfeiting or some other criminal offence, such as theft or robbery. It should be clearly stated that the mutilated or damaged banknotes will be withheld as evidence and will be presented to the competent authorities to initiate or to support an ongoing criminal investigation. If the competent authorities do not decide otherwise, the banknotes which have been withheld as evidence will be returned to the applicant at the end of the investigation. The applicant may subsequently resubmit the banknotes to the NCB for exchange. Furthermore, it is appropriate to introduce an obligation for NCBs to withhold the presented banknotes, where they know or have sufficient reason to believe that the banknotes have been intentionally mutilated or damaged, in order to avoid the return of such banknotes into circulation or to prevent the applicant from presenting such banknotes to another NCB for exchange.\n(4) It is deemed necessary to introduce a fee in order to allow NCBs to receive compensation for the labour-intensive analysis they perform. Therefore, it is appropriate to replace the existing Article 3(2)(e) of Decision ECB/2001/7 with an autonomous provision containing the conditions for the imposition of the fee. It is acknowledged that a distinction should be made between members of the general public and professional banknote handlers which have damaged euro banknotes by using anti-theft devices, and that only the latter should be charged, considering that the fee is deemed to be an appropriate means to encourage the proper handling of anti-theft devices by all professional banknote handlers.\n(5) A minimum number of euro banknotes, the exchange of which is not subject to a fee, should be determined in order to avoid insignificant charges for the exchange of only a few euro banknotes. In addition, euro banknotes which have been mutilated or damaged in bulk due to the use of anti-theft devices should be presented for exchange in sets of not less than 100 banknotes,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Article 3", "of Decision ECB/2001/7 is replaced by the following: \"Article 3\nExchange of mutilated or damaged euro banknotes\n1.

Where NCBs know or have sufficient reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed or that the banknotes have been intentionally mutilated or damaged, they shall refuse to exchange them.\nWhere NCBs know or have sufficient reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, they shall withhold against acknowledgement of receipt the mutilated or damaged banknotes as evidence to be presented to the competent authorities to initiate or to support an ongoing criminal investigation. Unless otherwise decided by the competent authorities, the banknotes shall be returned to the applicant at the end of the investigation and shall thereafter qualify for exchange.
