Melamine is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of amino resins and plastics and is used as a monomer and as an additive for plastics. High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.\n(3) To counter the risk for health that may result from exposure to the melamine content of feed and food products, Commission Decision 2008/798/EC imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC, provides for a prohibition to import into the Community products containing milk or milk products, intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children, and requires Member States to perform systematic checks at import on other feed and food containing milk or milk products. That Decision also requires Member States to withdraw from the market any such product found to contain melamine in excess of 2,5 mg/kg product.\n(4) According to information made available by the Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food, high level of melamine have been found recently also in products containing soya or soya products imported from China. Melamine has also been found in ammonium bicarbonate, used in food industry as raising agent. It is therefore appropriate to extend the measures laid down in Commission Decision 2008/798/EC also to those products.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/798/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
