whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possibility of reintroducing customs duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;\nWhereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly rapid cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which must in particular be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings;\nWhereas the arrangements applicable to imports of textile products from the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are governed by the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 (4);\nWhereas the agreement on 'wines and spirits` envisaged by the Europe Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Slovenia has yet to be concluded and whereas certain concessions should be granted on an autonomous and transitional basis pending conclusion of the aforementioned agreement;\nWhereas it is appropriate, in view of the current difficult market situation, to limit the previous concessions for 'baby beef`, without prejudice to future bilateral negotiations with the countries concerned;\nWhereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said tariff quotas and to ensure uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;\nWhereas the decision for the opening of tariff quotas should be taken by the Community in the execution of its international obligations; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States;\nWhereas, for the sake of rationalization and simplification, it is appropriate to provide that the Commission may, having consulted the Customs Code Committee, and without prejudice to the specific procedures provided for in Article 10 of this Regulation, make any necessary changes and technical amendments necessary to this Regulation;\nWhereas the import arrangements are renewed on the basis of the conditions established by the Council in relation to the development of the relations between the Community and each of the countries concerned, including the regional approach; whereas it is appropriate, therefore, to limit the duration of these arrangements to one year in order to permit a regular review of compliance, without prejudice to the possibility of modifying the geographical coverage of this Regulation at any other time,", "main_body": ["1.
