Because of this provision, the production of certain producers who are members of a producer organisation which has its head office in another Member State, or the production of producer organisations belonging to an association of producer organisations which has its head office in another Member State counts against the processing threshold of the Member State in which the producer organisation or association of producer organisations has its head office. Experience indicates that this offset should be made against the threshold of the Member State where the raw material is produced.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1535/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Processed Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1535/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the first subparagraph of Article 23(1) is replaced by the following:\n2. in the first subparagraph of Article 24, point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(b) the quantity covered by the aid application whereby that quantity, broken down by contract and, if appropriate, by the aid level applicable in the Member State where the raw material is produced, may not exceed the quantity accepted for processing, after deduction of any reduction rates applied;\u2019\n3. the following subparagraph is added after the first subparagraph of Article 27(1):", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the 2006/07 marketing year.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29.
