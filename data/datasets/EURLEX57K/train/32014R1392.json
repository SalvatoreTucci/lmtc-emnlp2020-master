Those Member States have submitted joint recommendations\u00a0(2) to the Commission after consultation of the Mediterranean Sea Advisory Council. Scientific contribution was obtained from relevant scientific bodies. In line with Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 only those measures in the joint recommendations which comply with Article 15(6) of that Regulation should be included in this Regulation.\n(4) As regards the Mediterranean Sea, Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 establishes a landing obligation for all catches of species which are subject to catch limits and also for catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes as defined in Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006\u00a0(3). According to Article 15(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the landing obligation should apply in small pelagic fisheries, large pelagic fisheries and fisheries for industrial purposes at the latest from 1 January 2015.\n(5) In accordance with the joint recommendation, the discard plan should cover all catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 caught in small pelagic fisheries using pelagic mid-water trawl and/or purse seines in the Mediterranean Sea (i.e. fisheries for anchovy, sardine, mackerel and horse mackerel) from 1 January 2015.\n(6) To avoid disproportionate costs of handling unwanted catches and in accordance with Article 15(5)(c)(ii) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is appropriate to establish a de minimis exemption from the landing obligation in terms of percentage of the total annual catches of species subject to the landing obligation in small pelagic fisheries. The joint recommendations submitted by the concerned Member States support the case for the de minimis exemption, due to the increased costs entailed in the management of unwanted catches, both on board (sorting and boxing, storage and conservation) and on land (transport and storage, conservation, marketing and processing or destruction as special waste), compared to the limited and sometimes inexistent economic profit that could be derived from those unwanted catches. The evidence provided by the Member States was reviewed by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) which concluded that the joint recommendations contained reasoned arguments related to the increase of costs in handling unwanted catches, supported in some cases with a qualitative assessment of the costs\u00a0(4). In light of the above and in the absence of differing scientific information, it is appropriate to establish the de minimis exemption in accordance with the percentage levels proposed in the joint recommendations and at levels not exceeding those allowed under Article 15(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013\n(7) In accordance with the joint recommendations and taking into account the time- frame set out in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2015. In accordance with Article 15(6) of that Regulation, it should apply for no more than 3 years,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation specifies the details for implementing the landing obligation, as provided for in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, from 1 January 2015 in the Mediterranean Sea, to all catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic fisheries set out in the Annex.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018minimum size\u2019 means the minimum size of marine organisms as established in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006.\n(b) \u2018GFCM Geographical Sub-Area\u2019 means General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Geographical Sub-Area as defined in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5);\n(c) \u2018Western Mediterranean Sea\u2019 means GFCM Geographical Sub-Areas 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.1, 11.2, 12;\n(d) \u2018Northern Adriatic Sea\u2019 means GFCM Geographical Sub-Area 17;\n(e) \u2018Southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea\u2019 means GFCM Geographical Sub-Areas 18, 19 and 20;\n(f) \u2018Malta Island and South of Sicily\u2019 means GFCM Geographical Sub-Areas 15 and 16;\n(g) \u2018Aegean Sea and Crete Island\u2019 means GFCM Geographical Sub-Area 22 and 23.", "De minimis exemption\nBy way of derogation from Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the following quantities may be discarded:\n(a) in the western Mediterranean Sea, up to 5 % of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic mid-water trawl and purse seines fisheries set out in point 1 of the Annex;\n(b) in the northern Adriatic Sea, up to 5 % of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic mid-water trawl and purse seines fisheries set out in point 2 of the Annex;\n(c) in the southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea:\n(i) up to 3 % of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic purse seines fisheries; and\n(ii) up to 7 % in 2015 and 2016 and up to 6 % in 2017 of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic mid-water trawl fisheries, set out in point 3 of the Annex;\n(d) in the Malta Island and South of Sicily:\n(i) up to 3 % of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic purse seines fisheries; and\n(ii) up to 7 % in 2015 and 2016 and up to 6 % in 2017 of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic mid-water trawl fisheries, set out in point 4 of the Annex;\n(e) in the Aegean Sea and Crete Island, up to 3 % of the total annual catches of species subject to minimum sizes in the small pelagic purse seines fisheries set out in point 5 of the Annex.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2017.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Treaties."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 28.12.2013, p.\u00a022.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Discard management plan for Western Mediterranean Sea (GSAs 1-12 except for GSAs 3 and 4): joint recommendation agreed by fisheries directors of France, Spain and Italy\u2019, transmitted on 2 July 2014; \u2018Discard management plan in North Adriatic Sea (GSA 17): joint recommendation by Croatia, Italy and Slovenia\u2019, transmitted on 25 June 2014; \u2018Greek discard plan for pelagic fisheries in Aegean Sea and Crete island (GSAs 22 and 23)\u2019, transmitted on 30 June 2014; \u2018Joint recommendation to the European Commission for a specific discard plan for pelagic fisheries in Southern Adriatic Sea, Western and Eastern Ionian Seas (GSAs 18-19-20)\u2019, transmitted by Greece and Italy on 25 June 2014; \u2018Discard management plan for Malta and the South of Sicily (GSAs 15-16): joint recommendation agreed by Italy and Malta\u2019, transmitted on 19 June 2014.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 of 21 December 2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0409, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a011).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a046th Plenary meeting report of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (PLEN-14-02), 7-11 July 2014, Copenhagen.
