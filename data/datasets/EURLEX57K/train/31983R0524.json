It is composed mainly of:\n- a lifting system consisting of two platforms each supported by a scissor lift and operated by hydraulic cylinders. The surface of the platforms is fitted with a belt conveyor and with powered rollers enabling longitudinal and transverse container and pallet transfer,\n- a control platform,\n- an internal combustion engine used for operating both the handling system and the propulsion system,\n- a gearbox,\n- brakes,\n- stabilizers which function during handling operations;\nWhereas the Common Customs Tariff annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 (2), as last amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3000/82 (3), classifies 'works trucks, mechanically propelled, of the types used in airports for short-distance transport or handling of goods' under heading No 87.07 and 'lifting, handling, loading or unloading machinery' under heading No 84.22;\nWhereas these two headings merit consideration for the classification of the abovementioned vehicle;\nWhereas the vehicle in question is not used, even over short distances, for the transport of containers or other goods; whereas it is placed, unloaded, next to the aircraft and used for handling containers and pallets during the loading and unloading of aircraft;\nWhereas, consequently, this is not a works truck fitted with lifting equipment but a self-propelled lifting machine for loading and unloading;\nWhereas, therefore, the machine in question must be classified under subheading 84.22 B IV of the Common Customs Tariff;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature,", "main_body": ["A self-propelled container and pallet loader, used in airports for loading and unloading aircraft, composed mainly of:\n- a lifting system consisting of two platforms each supported by a scissor lift and operated by hydraulic cylinders.
