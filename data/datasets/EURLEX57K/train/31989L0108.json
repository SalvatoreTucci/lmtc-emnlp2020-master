whereas they may create unequal conditions of competition and therefore have a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the  common market;\nWhereas it is therefore necessary to approximate these laws;\nWhereas to that end the Community rules must be given the widest possible scope, extending to all quick-frozen foodstuffs intended for human consumption and including not only products intended for supply without further processing to the ultimate  consumer and to restaurants, hospitals, canteens and to other similar mass caterers, but; also products having to be further processed or prepared;\nWhereas, however, these rules need not apply to products not offered for sale as quick-frozen foodstuffs;\nWhereas it is in any case appropriate to lay down the general principles which any quick-frozen foodstuffs must satisfy;\nWhereas at a later stage special provisions over and above the general principles may, where necessary, be adopted for certain categories of quick-frozen foodstuffs,in accordance with the procedure applicable to each of these categories;\nWhereas the purpose of quick-freezing is to preserve the intrinsic characteristics of foodstuffs by a process of rapid freezing; whereas it is necessary to attain a temperature of -18 \u00b0C or lower at all points in the product;\nWhereas at -18 \u00b0C all microbiological activity likely to impair the quality of a foodstuff is suspended; whereas it is therefore necessary to maintain at least that temperature, subject to a certain technically inevitable tolerance, during the storage  and distribution of quick-frozen foodstuffs before their sale to the ultimate consumer;\nWhereas for technical reasons certain temperature increases are inevitable and may therefore be tolerated provided they do not harm the quality of the products, which may be ensured by complying with good storage and distribution practice, taking  account in particular of the proper level of stock rotation;\nWhereas the performance of certain technical equipment at present in use for the local distribution of quick-frozen foodstuffs is not capable of ensuring in every case full compliance with the temperature limits imposed in this Directive, and it is  therefore necessary to provide for a transitional system allowing for existing material to be used for its normal lifetime;\nWhereas this Directive need merely state the objectives to be attained as regards both the equipment used for the quick-freezing process and the temperatures to be observed in the storage, handling, transport and distribution installations and  equipment;\nWhereas it is incumbent upon Member States to ensure by means of official checks that the equipment used is capable of meeting these objectives;\nWhereas such checks render superfluous any system of official certification for trade purposes;\nWhereas it is desirable to provide for the possibility of using cryogenic fluids in direct contact with quick-frozen foodstuffs: whereas therefore these fluids must be sufficiently inert not to impart to the foodstuffs any constituents in quantities  liable to constitute a hazard to human health, or to.\ngive rise to an unacceptable change in the composition of foodstuffs, or to impair their organoleptic characteristics;\nWhereas in order to attain this objective it is necessary to adopt a list of these substances and to lay down criteria for their purity and conditions for their use;\nWhereas quick-frozen foodstuffs intended for the ultimate consumer and for restaurants, hospitals, canteens and other similar mass caterers are subject, as far as their labelling is concerned, to the rules laid down by Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18  December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (3), as last amended by Directive 86/197/EEC (4);

This Directive shall apply to quick-frozen foods intended for human consumption, hereinafter referred to as 'quick-frozen foodstuffs'.\n2. For the purposes of this Directive 'quick-frozen foodstuffs' means foodstuffs\n- which have undergone a suitable freezing process known as 'quick-freezing' whereby the zone of maximum crystallization is crossed as rapidly as possible, depending on the type of product, and the resulting temperature of the product (after thermal  stabilization) is continuously maintained at a level of -18 \u00b0C or lower at all points, and\n- which are marketed in such a way as to indicate that they possess this characteristic.\nFor the purposes of this Directive, ice-cream and other edible ices shall not be regarded as quick-frozen foodstuffs.\n3. This Directive shall apply without prejudice to Community provisions relating to:\n(a) the common organization of markets in the agricultural and fisheries sectors;\n(b) veterinary hygiene.", "Only the products defined in Article 1 (2) may bear the names provided for in Articles 8 and 9.", "1. Raw materials used in the manufacture of quick-frozen foodstuffs must be of sound, genuine and merchantable quality and be of the required degree of freshness\n2.
