The purpose was to make provision for the situation where those imports also become subject to the payment of a safeguard duty, as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1694/2002 of 27 September 2002 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products(4).\n(2) In such circumstances, and where the anti-dumping duty is less than, or equal to, the amount of the safeguard duty, it was considered appropriate that no anti-dumping duty should be payable. Where the anti-dumping duty is greater than the amount of the safeguard duty, it was considered appropriate that only that part of the anti-dumping duty which is in excess of the amount of the safeguard should be payable.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 584/96 and (EC) No 763/2000 were prolonged by Council Regulation (EC) No 964/2003(5). However, no provision similar to the one described in recital 2 hereto was made by Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 for the situation where imports also become subject to the payment of a safeguard duty.\n(4) Consequently, Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 should be amended so as to make provision for the situation where imports also become subject to the payment of a safeguard duty, in the same way as the amendments introduced into Council Regulations (EC) No 584/96 and (EC) No 763/2000 by Regulation (EC) No 778/2003.\n(5) This Regulation should apply retroactively from the date of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 964/2003,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) in Article 1, the following paragraph shall be inserted:\n\"2a Notwithstanding paragraph 2, where imports of the product concerned from Thailand are subject to payment of a safeguard additional duty pursuant to Article 1(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1694/2002(6), the rate of anti-dumping duty applicable to the free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows:\n>TABLE>\";\n(b) in Article 3, the first paragraph shall be numbered \"1\" and the following paragraph shall be inserted:\n\"2.
