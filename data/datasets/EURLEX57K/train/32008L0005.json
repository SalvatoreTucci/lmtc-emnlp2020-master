In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) In order to ensure that consumers receive adequate information, it is necessary to provide for compulsory indication, for certain foodstuffs, of other particulars in addition to those provided for in Article 3 of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(3) Packaging gases used in packaging certain foodstuffs should not be regarded as ingredients for the purposes of Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/13/EC and therefore should not be included in the list of ingredients on the label.\n(4) However, consumers should be informed of the use of such gases inasmuch as this information enables them to understand why the foodstuff they have purchased has a longer shelf life than similar products packaged differently.\n(5) With a view to providing adequate consumer information, the labelling of foodstuffs which contain sweeteners should bear details to that effect.\n(6) Moreover, warnings should also be given on the labelling of foodstuffs containing certain categories of sweetener.\n(7) Furthermore, it is necessary to provide labelling which gives the consumers clear information on the presence of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in confectionery and beverages. In the case of high contents of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in those products, the consumers, and in particular those suffering from hypertension, should in addition be informed that excessive intake should be avoided. To ensure a good understanding of such information by the consumers, the well known term \u2018liquorice\u2019 should be preferably used.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in conformity with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(9) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,", "main_body": ["Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 3 of Directive 2000/13/EC, the labelling of the foodstuffs listed in Annex I to this Directive shall include additional particulars, as set out in that Annex.", "Directive 94/54/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 January 2008.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29.
