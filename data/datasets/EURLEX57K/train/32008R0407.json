Pending the completion of the procedures necessary for its entry into force, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part was signed and concluded and entered into force on 1 January 2008\u00a0(2).\n(3) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement establish a contractual trade regime between the Community and Montenegro. The bilateral trade concessions on the Community side are equivalent to the concessions applicable within the unilateral autonomous trade measures under Regulation (EC) No\u00a02007/2000.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 to take into account these developments. In particular it is appropriate to remove Montenegro from the list of beneficiaries of the tariff concessions granted for the same products under the contractual regime. In addition, it is necessary to adjust the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas have been granted under the contractual regimes.\n(5) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1398/2007\u00a0(3), Montenegro and Kosovo\u00a0(4) have been removed from the scope of application of the Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules\u00a0(5); Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 has therefore become obsolete and should be deleted.\n(6) Montenegro will remain beneficiary of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 insofar as that Regulation provides for concessions which are more favourable than the concessions existing under the contractual regime.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
