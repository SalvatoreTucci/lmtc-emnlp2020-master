For the purpose of this Regulation the products in question should be in a bulk pack. In addition, it is necessary to limit the scope of footnote 13 to section 9 in relation to skimmed milk powder by setting a maximum limit for non-lactic additions to ensure that offers are made for a standard product.\n(3) In order to achieve an efficient administration of Community funds, to take better account of changing export possibilities for the products concerned and to increase transparency and the opportunity for operators to participate in the export scheme, refunds for those products should be fixed by a tender procedure, as was already provided for in Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68\u00a0(3).\n(4) The destinations for which refunds may be fixed are indicated in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1523/2003 of 28 August 2003 fixing the export refund on milk and milk products\u00a0(4).\n(5) To ensure equal treatment for all interested parties, all Commission decisions relating to the tender should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(6) In order to reduce the administrative burden on operators and national administrations the tendering procedure should be incorporated in the export licence application procedure and the tender security should also constitute the licence security. Tenders should contain the data needed to assess them, and communications between Member States and the Commission should be provided for. In view of the sensitivity of the data concerned, tenders should not be examined in public.\n(7) A tendering security should ensure that the accepted quantities are exported pursuant to the licence issued under the invitation to tender. The security should accordingly be forfeited where quantities are not exported. Therefore provisions should be adopted for the lodging, the release and the forfeiting of the tendering security in addition to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(5).\n(8) A maximum export refund should be fixed. However, situations may arise on the market in which economic or other aspects urge that none of the tenders received be accepted.\n(9) Detailed rules should be laid down to ensure that tenderers are notified of the outcome of the invitation to tender and that the necessary licences are issued for the export of the quantities allocated.\n(10) By way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6), the rights deriving from licences should be confined to the successful tenderers to avoid speculation.\n(11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products\u00a0(7), applies to all export licences and export refunds in the dairy sector. To the extent necessary derogations from this Regulation should be provided. They should concern the refund amount applicable, the provision relating to applications lodged on Thursdays and the product code of the nomenclature for refunds indicated in licences. In addition, as licences issued in the context of the tender are for specific products, the provisions in relation to the use of a licence for another product should not be applicable. To ensure all licences have the same validity period the closing date for the submission of tenders should be taken as the commencement date.\n(12) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation provides for a tender procedure for fixing export refunds on the following milk products, listed in section 9 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87, of Community origin:\n(a) skimmed milk powder in bags of at least 25 kilograms net weight and containing no more than 0,5\u00a0% by weight of added non-lactic matter falling under product code ex\u00a0ex040210199000;\n(b) natural butter in blocks of at least 20 kilograms net weight falling under product codes ex\u00a0ex040510199500 and ex\u00a0ex040510199700;\n(c) butteroil in containers of at least 190 kilograms net weight falling under product code ex\u00a0ex040590109000.", "Tendering procedure\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The standing invitation to tender shall be opened in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 42(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 guaranteeing equality of access for all persons established in the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The standing invitation to tender shall contain the following:\n(a) the tendering periods;\n(b) opening and closing time between which tenders may be submitted;\n(c) the minimum quantity each tender must provide for;\n(d) the amount of the tendering security; and\n(e) the address of the competent authorities of the Member States to which tenders shall be submitted.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall inform operators by the means which they consider the most appropriate as regards the application of the tendering procedure.", "Submission of tenders\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Written tenders shall be submitted to the competent authority of a Member State in conjunction with and using the application form for an export licence as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.
