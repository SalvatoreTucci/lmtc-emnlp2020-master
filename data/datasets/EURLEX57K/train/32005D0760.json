There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live birds other than poultry.\n(2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in imported birds in quarantine in a Member State, it appears therefore appropriate to suspend imports of these birds from certain areas at risk and to use for the definition of the areas a reference to the relevant Regional Commissions of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n(3) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (1) to Directive 90/425/EEC\u00a0(3) provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States.
