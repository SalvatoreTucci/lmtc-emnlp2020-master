whereas vaccination against swine fever has not been authorized for at least the preceding 12 months; whereas the holdings concerned contain no pigs which have been vaccinated against swine fever; whereas consequently these parts of the territory fulfil the requirements for being recognized as officially swine fever free for the purpose of intra-Community trade in fresh meat;\nWhereas, within the framework of an eradication plan, the Commission, by Decision 88/17/EEC (7), has recognized certain regions in France as being officially swine fever free;\nWhereas, within the framework of an eradication plan, the Commision, by Decision 88/153/EEC (8), has recognized certain regions in the Netherlands as being officially swine fever free;\nWhereas there are certain parts of the Netherlands in which no pigs have been vaccinated during the previous 12 months; whereas these parts may also be recognized as officially swine fever free in accordance with Directive 87/489/EEC;\nWhereas Directive 87/489/EEC must be transported into national legislation no later than 31 December 1988; whereas it is necessary to take this situation into consideration in respect of the implications for Member States of the fact that those parts of the Netherlands concerned have been recognized as officially swine fever free;\nWhereas in a certain part of the Netherlands swine fever has not been detected for more than one year; whereas, consequently, this part of the territory fulfils the requirements for being recognized as swine fever free for the purpose of intra-Community trade in fresh meat;\nWhereas a Commission Decision has already established the terminology to be used to define regions when notifying outbreaks of swine fever;
