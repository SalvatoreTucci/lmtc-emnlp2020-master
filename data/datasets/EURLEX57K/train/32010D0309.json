Modern technologies allow the exchange of expert opinions in virtual meetings using audio or video devices or online applications. The use of these tools would allow wider participation of experts in the activities of the Scientific Committees while minimising the environmental impact and costs and reduce expert time needed for travelling.\n(4) In the case of participation from a distance by electronic means, the amount of the indemnity should be related to the duration of the meeting (short attendance, full day or only morning or afternoon meeting).\n(5) It is therefore necessary to adjust the rules for the payment of participation indemnities to members, advisors and external experts.
