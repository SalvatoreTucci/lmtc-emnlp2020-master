It provides that imports of equidae into the Community are only authorised from third countries or parts of the territory thereof, which have been free from glanders for a period of at least six months.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species\u00a0(3) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(3) Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and glanders do occur in parts of the territory of Brazil and therefore imports of equidae, and as a consequence of their semen, ova and embryos, are only allowed from the disease free parts of the territory of that country described as \u2018BR-1\u2019 in column 4 of Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC. The State of S\u00e3o Paulo is included in that list.\n(4) In September 2008, Brazil notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the confirmation of a case of glanders in a horse in the suburbs of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. Since that State is no longer free from glanders, it should be deleted from the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.\n(5) However, in the light of the information and guarantees provided by Brazil, it is possible to allow for a limited period of time from a part of the territory of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 93/195/EEC of 2 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export\u00a0(4).\n(6) In addition, the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should take account of the separation of the customs territories of Montenegro and Serbia and those two third countries should be listed separately, thus allowing the importation of live equidae, their semen, ova and embryos from both Montenegro and Serbia under the same additional conditions as specified at present for \u2018Serbia and Montenegro\u2019 in that Annex.\n(7) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the entry for Brazil is replaced by the following:\n\u2018BR Brazil BR-0 Whole country  \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nBR-1 The States of: D X X X X X X X X X\nBR-2 Sociedade Hipica Paulista, the airport Viracopos and the auto route between the two premises in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo D \u2014 X \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Valid until 15.11.2008\u2019\n2. the following entry for Montenegro is inserted between the entry for Morocco and the entry for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia:\n\u2018ME Montenegro ME-0 Whole country B X X X X X X X X X\u2019\n3. the following entry for Serbia is inserted between the entry for Qatar and the entry for Russia:\n\u2018RS Serbia RS-0 Whole country B X X X X X X X X X\u2019\n4. the entry for Serbia and Montenegro is deleted.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 42.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 14.9.1992, p. 54.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 11.3.2004, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 86, 6.4.1993, p. 1."}
