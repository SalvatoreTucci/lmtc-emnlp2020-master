For certain other third countries the information available at Union level was not sufficient to include those third countries in that Decision. Therefore, the Commission adopted Commission Decision 2008/989/EC\u00a0(3).\n(2) In order to prevent trade patterns from being disrupted after 31 December 2014, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of Decision 2008/989/EC pending an adaptation of Decision 2008/971/EC.\n(3) Pending a future amendment of Decision 2008/971/EC, it is also appropriate to temporarily authorise Member States to take decisions in respect of forest reproductive material of the category \u2018tested\u2019 produced in the third countries already listed in Decision 2008/971/EC.\n(4) The information communicated by Member States shows that forest reproductive material originating in New Zealand is not accompanied by a master certificate or an official certificate issued by that country. New Zealand should, therefore, be deleted from the list of countries in relation with which Member States are authorised to take decisions as regards the equivalence of the guarantees afforded by forest reproductive material.\n(5) Therefore, Decision 2008/989/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/989/EC is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 3 is replaced by the following:\n(2) The Annex is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a011, 15.1.2000, p.\u00a017.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Decision 2008/971/EC of 16 December 2008 on the equivalence of forest reproductive material produced in third countries (OJ L\u00a0345, 23.12.2008, p.\u00a083).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2008/989/EC of 23 December 2008 authorising Member States, in accordance with Council Directive 1999/105/EC, to take decisions on the equivalence of the guarantees afforded by forest reproductive material to be imported from certain third countries (OJ L\u00a0352, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a055).\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Decision 2008/989/EC is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX\nCountry of origin Species Category Type of basic material\nBelarus Picea abies Karst.
