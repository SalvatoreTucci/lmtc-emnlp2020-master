Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by use of the manual method (ZP).\n2. This method may be implemented using a ruler, with the grading determined on the basis of the prediction equation. It is based on the manual measurement on the midline of the split carcase of the thickness of the fat and of the thickness of the muscle.\n3. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of the visible fat on the midline of the split carcase, measured in the point G \u2014 thinnest part over the gluteus medius muscle (in millimetres),\nx2 = the thickness of the visible muscle on the midline of the split carcase, measured in point M \u2014 distance between the cranial edge of the gluteus medius muscle and the dorsal edge of the vertebral canal (in millimetres).\nPART 2\nIntrascope (Optical Probe)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cIntrascope (Optical Probe)\u201d produced by SFK, Denmark.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 millimetres (and of 19 millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an operating distance of between 8 and 50 millimetres.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx = the thickness of back-fat in millimetres, measured on left side of carcase behind the last rib 6 cm of the midline of the carcase.\nPART 3\nPG 200 (Pork Grader)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cPG 200 (Pork Grader)\u201d produced by SFK, Denmark.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with 1. manual measuring device, which has an operating distance of between 9 and 150 millimetres, and 2. linked computing system which records data and calculates lean meat content of carcase.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of back-fat in millimetres, measured on left side of carcase behind the last rib 7 cm of the midline of the carcase,\nx2 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres measured on left side of carcase behind the last rib 7 cm off the midline of the carcase."}
