This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of rye held by the German intervention agency available on the internal market, which had earlier been destined for export under Commission Regulation (EC) No 864/2003(5), with a view to its use on the internal market in animal feed, and to repeal that Regulation.\n(5) In order to ensure that the rye really is processed, the procedure should be specially monitored and the successful tenderer should provide a security, to be released on conditions to be laid down.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96(7), lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use of products from intervention.\n(7) In order to ensure sound management of the quantities awarded, provision should be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum sale price.\n(8) When the German intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(9) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(10) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["1.

In the event that tenders are submitted for the same lot and for a quantity larger than that available, the Commission may fix this price separately for each lot.\nWhere tenders are made at the minimum selling price, the Commission may fix an award coefficient for the quantities offered at the same time as it fixes the minimum selling price.\nThe Commission shall decide in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1766/92.", "1.
