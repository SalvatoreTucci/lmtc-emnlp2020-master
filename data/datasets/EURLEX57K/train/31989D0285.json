SOLBES\nMEASURES TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE OF CONTAINERS WITH THE STANDARDS FOR TRANSPORT OF GOODS UNDER CUSTOMS SEALS\nRESOLUTION No 46\nAdopted on 20 November 1987\nby the Group of Experts on Customs Questions Affecting Transport\nTHE GROUP OF EXPERTS ON CUSTOMS QUESTIONS AFFECTING TRANSPORT,\nBearing in mind the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention (1975)) and Annex 7 thereto,\nConsidering the need for continued compliance of containers with the standards for transport of goods under customs seals;\nRECOMMENDS to the contracting parties to the TIR Convention (1975) the following measures to ensure the continued compliance of containers with the standards for transport of goods under customs seal (Articles 13 and 14 and Annex 7 of the TIR Convention (1975)):\n1. When a container has a serious defect and consequently no longer complies with the standards under which it was approved for transport under customs seal, the customs should notify the party responsible for the container and afford him the opportunity to restore the container to the condition which had justified its approval if this can be accomplished expeditiously. After the appropriate repairs to the container, it can continue its trip under customs seal. If the container is not properly repaired or if the party concerned prefers to have the container repaired in another country where the approval of the container was given, the customs should either:\n(a) refuse sealing and transport approval if sealing is considered necessary; or\n(b) remove the container from circulation and have the contents transhipped to another means of transport; or\n(c) allow the container to go forward under appropriate procedures which do not involve any risk of smuggling or loss or damage to the container's contents, the defect being annotated on transit documents.\n2. When the customs causes the approval plate to be removed or when a serious defect is discovered in a series of containers which renders them no longer in compliance with the standards under which they were approved for tansport under customs seal, the approval authority or, where appropriate, the customs administration responsible for the approval should be notified accordingly. The original certifying authority should be invited to participate in the recertification process when it is conducted outside the territory of that contracting party.\nNote:\nA container shall be considered to have a serious defect if:\n(a) goods can be removed from, or introduced into, the sealed part of the container without leaving obvious traces of tampering or without breaking the customs seal;\n(b) customs seals cannot be simply and effectively affixed to the container;\n(c) it contains concealed spaces where goods may be hidden;\n(d) spaces capable of holding goods are not readily accessible for customs inspection.\nREQUESTS the contracting parties to notify the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, if possible by 1 July 1988, whether they accept this resolution;\nREQUESTS the Executive Secretary to circulate the replies received from governments."}
