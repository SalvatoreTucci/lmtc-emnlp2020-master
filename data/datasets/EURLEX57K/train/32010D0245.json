Regarding TSI noise, the wagons in question have to use, in combination with composite brake blocks, also louder cast iron blocks in order to achieve required braking performances. Therefore until more silent technology is in place the limits for pass-by noise (section 4.2.1.1 of the TSI) cannot be met.\n(5) The overall economical impact of application of the two TSIs, and more specifically of sections 4.2.3.1 and 4.2.3.4 of TSI freight wagons, to the wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company is estimated to almost EUR\u00a0204 million. This amount together with other requirements that would need to be applied to comply with the TSIs would not only heavily compromise the economical viability of the project but also seriously delay or bring to a halt its implementation.\n(6) The derogation is granted for a limited period of time that should be used by France to accelerate the development of innovative solutions promoted by the harmonised specifications and compliant with the TSIs in question.\n(7) The provisions of this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC,", "main_body": ["The partial derogation from TSI noise and TSI freight wagons requested by France on 27\u00a0August 2009 for LOHR wagons type NA and AFA in accordance with Article 9(1)(d) of Directive 2008/57/EC is granted with the following limitations:\n(a) with regard to provisions of section 4.2.1.1 of the TSI noise, for as long as no technical solution to achieve compliance is available;\n(b) with regard to provisions of sections 4.2.2.1.2.2, 4.2.2.3.2.4, 4.2.2.3.2.5 (type NA only), 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.4, 4.2.4.1.2.8 of the TSI freight wagons, until the revised decision on TSI freight wagons enters into force.\nIn any case, this partial derogation is no longer valid for wagons of these two types placed into service later than 1 January 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 April 2010.\nFor the Commission\nSiim KALLAS\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 191, 18.7.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 8.2.2006, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 8.12.2006, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 164, 30.4.2004, p. 1."}
