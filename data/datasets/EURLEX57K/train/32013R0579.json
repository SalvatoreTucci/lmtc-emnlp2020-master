As the berries do not undergo any treatment that impairs the skin, the raisins therefore have a skin of medium thickness.\nChemical characteristics\nThe degree of moisture must be less than 35\u00a0%. The sugar content must be greater than 50\u00a0% w/w.\n\u2014 Acidity: between 1.2 and 1.7\u00a0% in tartaric acid.\n\u2014 pH: between 3.5 and 4.5.\n\u2014 Water-soluble solids: greater than 65\u00a0\u00b0 Brix.\nOrganoleptic characteristics\n\u2014 The raisins retain the characteristic muscat flavour of the grapes from which they are produced: In the OIV Descriptor List the characteristic \u2018particular flavour\u2019 is graded as follows: 1\u00a0= none, 2\u00a0= muscat, 3\u00a0= foxy, 4\u00a0= herbaceous, 5\u00a0= other flavour; Muscat of Alexandria is classed as 2 and it is this variety of Muscat that is the OIV reference for this grade.\n\u2014 The muscat flavour is enhanced by an intense retronasal aroma dominated by the following terpenols: a-terpineol (aromatic herbs), linalol (rose), geraniol (geranium) and b-citronelol (citrus).\n\u2014 The degree of acidity, as indicated above, helps to create a specific sweet-sour balance.\n\u2014 The medium size, degree of moisture and Brix value give the raisins an elastic, flexible quality; the pulp feels fleshy and juicy in the mouth, tactile sensations which are not at all like the dry, inelastic feel dried fruit often has.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\nTraditional \u2018Pasas de M\u00e1laga\u2019 are obtained by sun-drying the ripe fruit of the Muscat of Alexandria variety of Vitis vinifera L., also known as Moscatel Gordo or Moscatel de M\u00e1laga.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\nNot applicable.\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nProduction and packaging must take place in the geographical area defined in point 4.\nProduction begins with the harvesting of healthy grapes, which never takes place before the phenological stage of \u2018ripening\u2019 (Baggiolini, 1952), avoiding fruit that are not intact or have been damaged by disease or fallen to the ground before harvesting.\nThe next step is drying the grapes by directly exposing the bunches to the sun. They must not be dried artificially. The work is done manually: every day the farmer turns the bunches of grapes that are spread out to dry so that they dry evenly on both sides.\nOnce the bunches of grapes are dry, the berries are removed by work known as picado, performed by hand using scissors whose size and shape are specially adapted so as not to impair the quality of the fruit removed from the dried bunches, or by machine in factories.\nOnce the raisins are ready, off or on the bunch, the production process continues in the raisin factories, where the following tasks must be performed before the packaged raisins can be placed on the market:\n\u2014 Receipt and collection of the raisins delivered by the raisin farmers;\n\u2014 The raisins are removed from the bunch, if this has not already been done by the farmer;\n\u2014 They are classed by average size of fruit, measured as the number of raisins per 100\u00a0grams;\n\u2014 Preparation for packaging: i.e. the separation into units of fruit that has already been classed and stored. There must always be fewer than 80 fruits per 100\u00a0grams net;\n\u2014 Packaging: by hand or by machine. This is the final stage of production and it plays a crucial role in protecting the quality characteristics of the raisins over time, so only by isolating it from the environment in clean, well-sealed packaging is it possible to preserve the delicate moisture balance that is such an important characteristic of the product.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nNot applicable.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe packaging must bear the following information (on top of the Protected Designation of Origin):\n\u2014 the sales name of the product: the name \u2018Pasas de M\u00e1laga\u2019 must be prominently displayed, with the words \u2018Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen\u2019 (Designation of Origin) immediately below.\n\u2014 The net quantity, in kilograms (kg) or grams (g),\n\u2014 Date of minimum durability.\n\u2014 The name, trading name or designation of the producer or the packager and, in any event, their registered office address,\n\u2014 The batch.\nThe name under which the product is sold, the net quantity and the use-by date must appear in the same field of view.\nIn all cases, the compulsory indications must be easy to understand, prominently displayed and easily visible, clearly legible and indelible. They shall not in any way be hidden, obscured or interrupted by other written or pictorial matter.\nAll packaging must include a label bearing the PDO logo and the words \u2018Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida\u2019 and \u2018Pasas de M\u00e1laga\u2019, plus a unique code for each unit.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nLOCATION\nCOUNTRY: SPAIN\nAUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY: ANDALUC\u00cdA\nPROVINCE: M\u00c1LAGA\nThere are areas of vineyard all over the Province of Malaga, north, south, east and west. In two of these areas most of the grapes have traditionally been grown for raisin production. The most important of these is the district of Axarquia in the eastern part of the province, to the east of the capital. The other area is at the far western end of the Malaga coast. The defined geographical area comprises the following municipalities:\nMUNICIPALITIES:\nAXARQUIA\nAlcauc\u00edn Alfarnate Alfarnatejo Algarrobo\nAlm\u00e1char \u00c1rchez Arenas Benamargosa\nBenamocarra El Borge Canillas de Acietuno Canillas de Albaida\nColmenar Comares C\u00f3mpeta C\u00fatar\nFrigiliana Iznate Macharaviaya M\u00e1laga\nMoclinejo Nerja Periana Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria\nRiogordo Salares Sayalonga Sedella\nTorrox Total\u00e1n V\u00e9lez M\u00e1laga Vi\u00f1uela\nMANILVA AREA\nCasares Manilva Estepona\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThere have been references to the link between vine growing and the defined geographical area since ancient times, right down till the present day. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) mentioned the fact that there were vineyards in Malaga in his work the \u2018Natural History\u2019. During the Nasrid dynasty era (13th-15th centuries) agricultural production was encouraged, in particular grape growing for raisin production. Vine growing flourished until the end of the 19th century, when a combination of commercial factors and plant health problems, mainly phylloxera (Viteus vitifoliae, Fitch) caused the sector to collapse. As a result, today\u2019s vineyards are scattered all over the province. In two of these areas most of the grapes have traditionally been grown for raisin production. Both areas of production are in the southern part of the province, bordering on the Mediterranean sea, so they have a subtropical Mediterranean climate. The uneven terrain is also a general feature of the Province of Malaga. Although grapes grown for raisin production no longer occupy as much land as they did before phylloxera, they are still an important factor in the economy and the socio-cultural environment in a large section of the province. They are grown in more than 35 municipalities by over 1\u00a0800 farmers on 2\u00a0200\u00a0ha of land.\nThe qualities of \u2018Pasas de M\u00e1laga\u2019 are to a large extent determined by the natural environment. One of the characteristic features of the geographical area is its uneven terrain: the landscape is a succession of hills and river beds with gradients of over 30\u00a0%. The territory, with a high mountain range to the north and the Mediterranean sea in the south, is a succession of canyons and river beds which form a very particular landscape with steep slopes, so that the whole of Axarquia is like a hillside going down to the sea. In the Manilva area, where the vines are close to the sea, the relief is gentler than in Axarquia.\nThe soil is essentially slatey, poor, shallow and with poor water holding capacity. The climate is subtropical Mediterranean, with mild winters, dry summers, little rain and long hours of sunshine (average 2\u00a0974 hours over the past decade).\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe size of Pasas de M\u00e1laga is one of their most appreciated and distinguishing characteristics, they are considered large, and clearly superior to other products of their kind, such as sultanas, currants and California Thompson seedless.\nThe raisins retain the characteristic muscat flavour of the grapes from which they are produced, and it is this variety of Muscat that is the OIV reference for one of the grades of \u2018particular flavour\u2019.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe link between the geographical area and the specific quality of the product derives directly from the conditions in which the raisins are produced. The relief facilitates the natural exposure of the bunches to the sun for drying: this method of drying preserves the quality of the skin and enhances the muscat flavour by concentrating the aromas. The hot, dry weather at harvest time is good for ripening and the accumulation in the berries of the dry matter and sugars that are important for successful drying, in turn enabling the pulp to retain its characteristic juiciness and elasticity. The hours of sunshine mean that the bunches can be exposed to the sun for short periods, so that the raisin retains the berry\u2019s acidity.\nIt is because the growing conditions are difficult that over time Muscat of Alexandria has become the main variety cultivated, as it is the best adapted to this particular environment. The variety has the genetic potential for differentiating characteristics such as size of the fruit, quality of the skin, properties of the pulp, muscat aromas and a high degree of insoluble solids (fibre) that are mostly in the pips.\nThe difficult terrain has made raisin production an artisanal activity, where tasks such as harvesting, putting the bunches of grapes out to dry in the sun and turning them as they dry, and selecting the fruit are done manually, and great attention is paid to quality. The task of removing the grapes from the bunch (picado) is also done manually, which is why \u2018Pasas de M\u00e1laga\u2019 often have the peduncle attached.\nDrying is an ancient, natural way of preserving food, whereby deterioration is prevented by the removal of excess water. Only with experience and knowledge acquired over the years is it possible to achieve the delicate moisture balance that gives this product some of its best-known organoleptic characteristics, as described in this specification.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttp://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/portal/export/sites/default/comun/galerias/galeriaDescargas/cap/industrias-agroalimentarias/denominacion-deorigen/Pliegos/PliegoPasas.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
