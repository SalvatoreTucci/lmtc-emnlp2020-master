It provides that Member States are to prohibit trade in products not complying with the Directive with effect from 1 April 2004.\n(2) At the time of the adoption of Directive 2001/15/EC a number of chemical substances added for specific nutritional purposes in some foods for particular nutritional uses, which are marketed in some Member States, could not be included in the Annex to that Directive because they had not been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF).\n(3) Those chemical substances that have since been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food or by the European Food Safety Authority and have received a favourable scientific evaluation should be included in the Annex to Directive 2001/15/EC.\n(4) Since products containing those substances are on the market in certain Member States, it is necessary that this Directive be transposed before 1 April 2004, in order to avoid that the prohibition provided for in Directive 2001/15/EC becomes applicable to those substances for a limited period of time, which would cause an undue disruption of the market.\n(5) Directive 2001/15/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Directive 2001/15/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.
