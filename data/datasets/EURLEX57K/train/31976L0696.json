Variation on returning to zero\nVariation on returning to zero immediately after removal of a load which has remained on the machine for half an hour may not exceed half the verification scale interval.\nThe test must be carried out under practically stable conditions.\n6.2.1.2. Discontinuous (digital) indication or printing\nAn extra load, equivalent to 1.4 of a discontinuous (digital) scale interval, placed gently on the machine at equilibrium, with any test load, must increase the initial indication.

Tare devices\nTare devices on weighing machines with two platforms are prohibited.\nTare devices are allowed on machines with a single platform on the condition that they allow the public to see:    - whether they are in use (see item 12.6.3), and\n- whether their setting is altered.\n11.5.2.2.3.1.

Semi-automatic tare devices\nThese devices are authorized on the condition that:        - they can only be operated when the machine is in stable equilibrium,\n- the action of the tare devices does not permit a reduction of the value of the tare,\n- their effect can only be cancelled when there is no load on the load receptor.\nIn addition, the machines shall comply with one of the following two requirements:         1. the indication of the value of the tare appears on both sides of the machine for the duration of the weighing;\n2. the removal of the load from the load receptor, after operation of the tare device, has one of the following effects:          - the indication returns to zero and the effect of the tare device is cancelled,\n- the value of the tare with a \"minus\" sign is indicated,\n- all indications are blanked until the effect of the tare device is cancelled.\n11.5.2.2.3.3.
