Since the replacement of Directive 91/414/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this substance is deemed to have been approved under that Regulation and is listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances\u00a0(5).\n(2) In accordance with Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, presented to the Commission its view on the draft review report for ethylene\u00a0(6) on 16 December 2011. The Authority communicated its view on ethylene to the notifier. The Commission invited it to submit comments on the draft review report for ethylene. The draft review report and the view of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 1 February 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for ethylene.\n(3) It is confirmed that the active substance ethylene is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(4) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to amend the conditions of approval of ethylene. In particular, it is appropriate to modify the requested minimum purity level and to restrict the authorisations to indoor uses by professional users. Furthermore, when the Member States grant authorisations for plant protection products containing ethylene, they shall pay particular attention to the protection of operators, workers and bystanders and to the compliance of ethylene with the required specifications, irrespective of the form in which it is supplied to the user.\n(5) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) A reasonable period of time should be allowed before the application of this Regulation in order to allow Member States, the notifier and holders of authorisations for plant protection products containing ethylene to meet the requirements resulting from amendment to the conditions of the approval.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 February 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 March 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p. 89.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 379, 24.12.2004, p. 13.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority; Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ethylene.
