'inside information' shall mean information which has not been made public of a precise nature relating to one or several issuers of transferable securities or to one or several transferable securities, which, if it were made public, would be likely to have a significant effect on the price of the transferable security or securities in question;\n2.

Where the person referred to in paragraph 1 is a company or other type of legal person, the prohibition laid down in that paragraph shall apply to the natural persons who take part in the decision to carry out the transaction for the account of the legal person concerned.\n3.

The competent authorities in the Member States shall cooperate with each other whenever necessary for the purpose of carrying out their duties, making use of the powers mentioned in Article 8 (2). To this end, and notwithstanding Article 9, they shall exchange any information required for that purpose, including information relating to actions prohibited, under the options given to Member States by Article 5 and by the second sentence of Article 6, only by the Member State requesting cooperation. Information thus exchanged shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy to which the persons employed or formerly employed by the competent authorities receiving the information are subject.\n2. The competent authorities may refuse to act on a request for information:\n(a) where communication of the information might adversely affect the sovereignty, security or public policy of the State addressed;\n(b) where judicial proceedings have already been initiated in respect of the same actions and against the same persons before the authorities of the State addressed or where final judgment has already been passed on such persons for the same actions by the competent authorities of the State addressed.\n3. Without prejudice to the obligations to which they are subject in judicial proceedings under criminal law, the authorities which receive information pursuant to paragraph 1 may use it only for the exercise of their functions within the meaning of Article 8 (1) and in the context of administrative or judicial proceedings specifically relating to the exercise of those functions. However, where the competent authority communicating information consents thereto, the authority receiving the information may use it for other purposes or forward it to other States' competent authorities.", "1\nThe Community may, in conformity with the Treaty, conclude agreements with non-member countries on the matters governed by this Directive.", "2\nThe Contact Committee set up by Article 20 of Directive 79/279/EEC shall also have as its function:\n(a) to permit regular consultation on any practical problems which arise from the application of this Directive and on which exchanges of view are deemed useful;\n(b) to advise the Commission, if necessary, on any additions or amendments to be made to this Directive.", "3\nEach Member State shall determine the penalties to be applied for infringement of the measures taken pursuant to this Directive.
