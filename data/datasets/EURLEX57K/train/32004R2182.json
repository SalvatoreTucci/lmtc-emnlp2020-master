Euro coins, following their introduction in January 2002, circulate throughout the euro area as sole legal tender in metallic form.\n(3) Commission Recommendation 2002/664/EC of 19 August 2002 concerning medals and tokens similar to the euro coins\u00a0(4) recommended that certain visual characteristics should be avoided in the sale and production, stocking, importation and distribution, for sale or for other commercial purposes, of medals and tokens whose size is close to that of euro coins.\n(4) The Commission Communication of 23 July 1997 on the use of the euro symbol established the symbol \u2018\u20ac\u2019 and called upon all currency users to use the symbol for the description of monetary amounts denominated in euro.\n(5) The Commission communication of 22 October 2001 on copyright protection of the common face design of the euro coins\u00a0(5) defined the arrangements to be applied for the reproduction of the common face design of euro coins.\n(6) The visual characteristics of the euro coins were published by the Commission on 28 December 2001\u00a0(6).\n(7) Citizens may be led to believe that medals and tokens bearing the terms \u2018euro\u2019 or \u2018euro cent\u2019, the euro symbol, or a design similar to that which appears on the common face or on any of the national sides of the euro coins, have legal-tender status in any of the Member States that have adopted the euro, or in a participating third country.\n(8) There is an increasing risk that medals and tokens having a size and metal properties similar to euro coins may be unlawfully used in the place of euro coins.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate that medals and tokens having visual characteristics, size or metal properties which are similar to euro coins should not be sold, produced, imported or distributed for the purpose of sale or for other commercial purposes.\n(10) It is for each Member State to introduce applicable sanctions for infringements, with a view to achieving an equivalent protection of the euro against similar medals and tokens throughout the Community.", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018euro\u2019 means the legal currency of participating Member States as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 974/98 and of those participating third countries which have concluded an agreement with the Community on the introduction of the euro (hereinafter referred to as participating third countries);\n(b) \u2018euro symbol\u2019 means the symbol representing the euro \u2018\u20ac\u2019 as shown and described in Annex I;\n(c) \u2018medals and tokens\u2019 means those metallic objects, other than blanks intended for striking coins, which have the appearance and/or technical properties of a coin but are not issued under national or participating third country legislative provisions or other foreign legislative provisions, and which therefore are neither a legal means of payment nor legal tender;\n(d) \u2018gold\u2019, \u2018silver\u2019 and \u2018platinum\u2019 mean alloys containing gold, silver and platinum with a millesimal fineness in weight of at least 375, 500 and 850 respectively.
