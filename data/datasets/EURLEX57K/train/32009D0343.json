Decision 2007/131/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) For this reason, the Commission issued additional mandates pursuant to Decision No 676/2002/EC to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), to undertake further compatibility studies of ultra-wideband technology with radio-communication services.\n(4) In its reports submitted in response to these mandates, the CEPT advised the Commission to amend a number of technical aspects in Decision 2007/131/EC.\n(5) The additional studies by CEPT clarified the technical conditions under which specific mitigation techniques, notably detect and avoid (DAA) and low duty cycle (LDC), enable ultra-wide band equipment to be operated with higher transmission powers while offering equivalent protection comparable to the existing ultra-wide band generic limits.\n(6) The CEPT studies also demonstrated that ultra-wide band equipment may be used under more stringent conditions than the generic limits in automotive and railway vehicles. Such conditions may be relaxed as long as mitigation techniques, such as those mentioned above, are used in these vehicles.\n(7) Building material analysis (BMA) imaging systems can provide a host of innovative applications in detecting or taking images of pipes, wires and of other intra-wall structures in residential or commercial constructions. A common set of spectrum-access conditions for BMA equipment should assist those undertakings which want to provide related professional services using these applications across borders in the Community.\n(8) CEPT has advised the Commission that more relaxed conditions of use than the generic limits are to be feasible for BMA systems, given that their modes of operation, combined with their very low deployment densities and activity factors, further mitigate the possibility of harmful interference to radio-communication services.\n(9) The CEPT technical studies under the Commission mandates on BMA applications assume use in structures that are dense and thick enough to absorb most signals transmitted by the imaging system. These compatibility studies include, inter alia, the presumption that BMA equipment should cease transmission within ten seconds of the interruption of normal operation. Furthermore, although BMA devices may be sold as a consumer product, a maximum density of 6,7 BMA units/km2 are assumed to be used in the aggregate interference studies.\n(10) Pursuant to Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity\u00a0(3) (the R & TTE Directive), the Commission has given mandates (M/329 and M/407) to the European standardisation organisations to establish a set of harmonised standards covering ultra-wideband applications to be recognised under this Directive, and resulting in a presumption of conformity with its requirements. In response to mandates M/329 and M/407 from the EC, the ETSI has developed harmonised standard EN 302\u00a0065 on generic UWB equipment, harmonised standard EN 302\u00a0500 for UWB location tracking equipment and harmonised standard EN 302\u00a0435 on BMA equipment.\n(11) These respective harmonised standards describe in detail how equipment operating in frequency bands allocated by this Decision should operate and how this equipment can be tested for compliance with the limits stated in the harmonised standards.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/131/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
