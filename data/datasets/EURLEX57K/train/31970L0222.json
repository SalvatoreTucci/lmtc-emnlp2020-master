HARMEL  (1)OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1.\nANNEX\n1. SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS OF THE SPACE FOR MOUNTING REAR REGISTRATION PLATES\nThe space for mounting shall comprise an even or virtually even rectangular surface with the following minimum dimensions: >PIC FILE= \"T0002170\">\n2. LOCATION OF THE SPACE FOR MOUNTING AND THE FIXING OF PLATES The space for mounting shall be such that after correct fixing, the plates shall have the following characteristics:   2.1. Position of the plate in relation to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle\nThe centre point of the plate may not be situated to the right of the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the vehicle.\nThe left-hand edge of the plate may not be situated to the left of the vertical plane which is parallel to the longitudinal plane of symmetry and touches the extreme outer edge of the vehicle.\n2.2.  Position of the plate in relation to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the vehicle\nThe plate shall be perpendicular, or practically perpendicular, to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the vehicle.\n2.3.  Position of the plate in relation to the vertical plane\nThe plate shall be vertical subject to a tolerance of 5\u00ba. Where the shape of the vehicle so requires, however, it may be inclined to the vertical:    2.3.1.  at not more than 30\u00ba when the surface bearing the registration number faces upwards, provided that the height of the upper edge of the plate is not more than 1.20 metres from the ground;\n2.3.2.  at not more than 15\u00ba when the surface bearing the registration number faces downwards, provided that the height of the upper edge of the plate is more than 1.20 metres from the ground.\n2.4. Height of the plate from the ground\nThe height of the lower edge of the plate from the ground shall not be less than 0.30 metres ; the height of the upper edge of the plate from the ground shall not be more than 1.20 metres. However, where it is impossible in practice to comply with this latter provision, the height may exceed 1.20 metres but it must then be as close to that limit as the constructional characteristics of the vehicle allow and must in no case exceed 2 metres.\n2.5. Geometrical requirements regarding visibility\nThe plate shall be visible in the whole space included within the following four planes, viz : the two vertical planes touching the two lateral edges of the plate and forming an angle measured outwards of 30\u00ba with the longitudinal median of the vehicle ; the plane touching the upper edge of the plate and forming an angle measured upwards of 15\u00ba with the horizontal ; the horizontal plane through the lower edge of the plate (however, if the height of the upper edge of the plate from the ground is greater than 1.20 metres, this latter plane shall form an angle measured downwards of 15\u00ba with the horizontal).\n2.6.  Determination of the height of the plate from the ground\nThe heights given in 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 shall be measured with the vehicle unladen."}
