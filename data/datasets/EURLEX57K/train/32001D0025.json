In the case of cattle, sheep and goats that have died, either the specified risk materials must be removed or the whole carcase must be destroyed.\n(6) The Scientific Steering Committee has adopted a number of opinions related to the safety of animal by-products, including animal feed. The main conclusion of those scientific opinions is that animal by-products derived from animals not fit for human consumption following health inspection should not enter the feed chain.\n(7) Based on those scientific opinions, on 19 October 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption(10). The key issue of this proposal is the prohibiton of recycling certain animal by-products into the feed chain, namely dead animals and condemned animal material. The only raw material allowed to be used for the production of animal feed would then be material derived from animals declared fit for human consumption.\n(8) On 16 November 2000, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on BSE and safety of animal feedingstuffs, calling for an immediate ban of feeding animal meal to all farmed animals, unless the implementation of the above existing Community legislation is guaranteed by Member States and as long as the exclusion of animals who have died from the animal feed chain as proposed by the Commission has not come into force.\n(9) Recent Community inspections have identified weaknesses in relation to the implementation of existing Community legislation on the control of TSE. It is therefore appropriate to immediately prohibit the recycling into the feed chain of certain animal by-products. In the case of large animal disease outbreaks, special arrangements may be adopted.\n(10) In the light of recent developments in the BSE situation in the Community, on 21 November 2000, the Council invited the Commission to exclude dead animals from feed for farm animals.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\nfarmed animals: any animal which is kept, fattened or bred for the production of food;\npet animals: animals belonging to species normally nourished and kept, but not consumed, by man for purposes other than farming;\nexperimental animals: animals defined by Article 2 of Council Directive 86/609/EEC(11);\nfeed: feed of animal origin for farmed animals, including processed animal proteins as defined by Article 2(e) of Council Directive 92/118/EEC(12) as last amended by Commission Decision 1999/724/EC(13), rendered fats, fish oil, gelatine and hydrolysed proteins and dicalcium phosphate.", "Member States shall ensure that the following animal waste is not used for the production of feed for farmed animals:\n(a) all bovine animals, pigs, goats, sheep, solipeds, poultry, farmed fish and all other animals kept for agricultural production which have died on the farm but were not slaughtered for human consumption, including stillborn and unborn animals;\n(b) the following dead animals:\n(i) pet animals,\n(ii) zoo animals,\n(iii) circus animals,\n(iv) experimental animals,\n(v) wild animals designated by the competent authority;\n(c) animals which are killed on the farm for disease control measures;\n(d) without prejudice to instances of energency slaughtering for reasons of welfare, farm animals which have died in transit.", "This Decision shall apply at the latest by 1 March 2001.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 December 2000.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(2) OJ L 62, 15.3.1993, p. 49.\n(3) OJ L 363, 27.12.1990, p. 51.\n(4) OJ L 122, 24.4.1998, p. 59.\n(5) OJ L 135, 8.6.2000, p. 27.\n(6) OJ L 172, 7.7.1994, p. 23.\n(7) OJ L 41, 16.2.1999, p. 14.\n(8) OJ L 204, 4.8.1999, p. 37.\n(9) OJ L 158, 30.6.2000, p. 76.\n(10) COM (2000)574 final.\n(11) OJ L 358, 18.12.1986, p. 1.\n(12) OJ L 62, 15.3.1993, p. 49.\n(13) OJ L 290, 12.11.1999, p. 32."}
