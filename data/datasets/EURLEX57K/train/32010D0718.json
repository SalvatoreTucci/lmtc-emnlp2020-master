France has requested that the status of this island should change from that of outermost region, covered by Article 349 of the TFEU, to that of overseas country or territory, covered by Part Four of the TFEU.\n(3) France\u2019s request reflects the desire expressed by the elected representatives of the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, which is a French overseas collectivity, governed by Article 74 of the French Constitution, with autonomy, to obtain a status with regard to the Union which would be better suited to its status under national law, particularly given its remoteness from the mainland, its small insular economy largely devoted to tourism and subject to difficulties in obtaining supplies which hamper the application of some Union standards.\n(4) France has undertaken to conclude the agreements necessary to ensure that the interests of the Union are preserved when this change takes place. These agreements should relate firstly to monetary matters, as France intends to retain the euro as the sole currency on Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy and it must be ensured that the application of the law of the Union in the essential fields of the good functioning of economic and monetary union is maintained. Secondly, such agreements should relate to taxation and aim to guarantee that the mechanisms of Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums\u00a0(1) and Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments\u00a0(2), which aim in particular at combating fraud and cross-border tax evasion, will continue to apply in future to the territory of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy. The citizens of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy should remain citizens of the Union and should enjoy the same rights and freedoms within the Union as other French citizens, just as all citizens of the Union should continue to benefit from the same rights and freedoms in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy as they do now.\n(5) As a result, the change in the status with regard to the Union, of the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, in response to the democratically expressed request of its elected representatives, should not jeopardise the Union\u2019s interests and should be consistent with the access of the island to autonomous status under national law,", "main_body": ["With effect from 1 January 2012, the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy shall cease to be an outermost region of the Union and shall have the status of overseas country or territory referred to in Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).", "The TFEU shall consequently be amended as follows:\n1. in the first paragraph of Article 349, the words \u2018Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy\u2019 shall be deleted;\n2. in Article 355(1), the words \u2018Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy\u2019 shall be deleted;\n3. in Annex II, an indent shall be inserted, between that relating to \u2018Saint Pierre and Miquelon\u2019 and that relating to \u2018Aruba\u2019, which shall read as follows:\n\u2018\u2014 Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy,\u2019.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 October 2010.\nFor the European Council\nThe President\nH.
