Spectrofluorimeter with variable wavelength adjustment of excitation and emission wavelengths\n5. Procedure\n5.1. General\n5.1.1. Blank feed\nFor the performance of the recovery test (5.1.2) a blank feed should be analysed to check that neither lasalocid sodium nor interfering substances are present. The blank feed should be similar in type to that of the sample and lasalocid sodium or interfering substances should not be detected.\n5.1.2. Recovery test\nA recovery test should be carried out by analysing the blank feed which has been fortified by addition of a quantity of lasalocid sodium, similar to that present in the sample. To fortify at a level of 100 mg/kg, transfer 10,0 ml of the stock standard (3.10.1) to a 250 ml conical flask and evaporate the solution to approximately 0,5 ml. Add 50 g of the blank feed, mix thoroughly and leave for 10 minutes mixing again several times before proceeding with the extraction step (5.2).\nAlternatively, if a blank feed similar in type to that of the sample is not available (see 5.1.1), a recovery test can be performed by means of the standard addition method. In this case the sample to be analysed is fortified with a quantity of lasalocid sodium similar to that already present in the sample. This sample is analysed together with the unfortified sample and the recovery calculated by subtraction.\n5.2. Extraction\n5.2.1. Feedingstuffs\nWeigh to the nearest 0,01 g, from 5 g to 10 g of the sample into a 250 ml conical flask with stopper. Add 100,0 ml of acidified methanol (3.8) by pipette. Stopper loosely and swirl to disperse. Place the flask in an ultrasonic bath (4.1) at approximately 40\u00b0 C for 20 minutes, then remove and cool to room temperature. Allow to stand for about 1 hour until the suspended matter has settled, then filter an aliquot portion through a 0,45 \u03bcm membrane filter (4.2) into a suitable vessel. Proceed to the HPLC determination (5.3).\n5.2.2. Premixtures\nWeigh to the nearest 0,001 g about 2 g of the unground premix into a 250 ml graduated flask. Add 100,0 ml of acidified methanol (3.8) and swirl to disperse. Place the flask and contents in an ultrasonic bath (4.1) at approximately 40\u00b0 C for 20 minutes, then remove and cool to room temperature. Dilute to the mark with acidified methanol (3.8) and mix thoroughly. Allow to stand for one hour until the suspended matter has settled, then filter an aliquot portion through a 0,45 \u03bcm membrane filter (4.2). Dilute an appropriate volume of the clear filtrate with acidified methanol (3.8) to produce a final test solution containing about 4 \u03bcg/ml of lasalocid sodium. Proceed to the HPLC determination (5.3).\n5.3. HPLC Determination\n5.3.1. Parameters\nThe following conditions are offered for guidance; other conditions may be used, provided they yield equivalent results:\n>TABLE>\nCheck the stability of the chromatographic system, injecting the calibration solution (3.10.3) containing 4,0 \u03bcg/ml several times, until constant peak heights (or areas) and retention times are achieved.\n5.3.2. Calibration graph\nInject each calibration solution (3.10.3) several times and determine the mean peak heights (areas) for each concentration. Plot a calibration graph using the mean peak heights (areas) as the ordinates and the corresponding concentrations in \u03bcg/ml as the abscissae.\n5.3.3. Sample solution\nInject the sample extracts obtained in 5.2.1 or 5.2.2 several times, using the same volume as taken for the calibration solution and determine the mean peak heights (areas) of the lasalocid sodium peaks.\n6. Calculation of results\nFrom the mean peak height (area) produced by injection of the sample solution (5.3.3) determine the concentration of lasalocid sodium (\u03bcg/ml) by reference to the calibration graph.\n6.1. Feedingstuffs\nThe lasalocid sodium content, w (mg/kg) in the sample is given by the following formula:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nwhere:\n\u00df= lasalocid sodium concentration of the sample solution (5.2.1) in \u03bcg/ml\nV1= volume of the sample extract according to 5.2.1 in ml (i.e. 100)\nm= mass of the test portion in g\n6.2. Premixtures\nThe lasalocid sodium content, w (mg/kg) in the sample is given by the following formula:\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\nwhere:\n\u00df= lasalocid sodium concentration of the sample solution (5.2.2) in \u03bcg/ml\nV2= volume of the sample extract according to 5.2.2 in ml (i.e. 250)\nf= dilution factor according to 5.2.2\nm= mass of the test portion in g\n7. Validation of the results\n7.1. Identity\nMethods based on spectrofluorimetry are less subject to interference than those in which UV detection is used. The identity of the analyte can be confirmed by co-chromatography.\n7.1.1. Co-chromatography\nA sample extract (5.2.1 or 5.2.2) is fortified by the addition of an appropriate amount of a calibration solution (3.10.3). The amount of added lasalocid sodium should be similar to the amount of lasalocid sodium found in the sample extract. Only the height of the lasalocid sodium peak should be enhanced to an extent based on the amount of lasalocid sodium added and the dilution of the extract. The peak width, at half height, must be within \u00b1 10 % of the original peak width produced by the unfortified sample extract.\n7.2. Repeatability\nThe difference between the results of two parallel determinations carried out on the same sample must not exceed:\n- 15 % relative to the higher value for lasalocid sodium contents from 30 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg;\n- 15 mg/kg for lasalocid sodium contents from 100 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg;\n- 7,5 % relative to the higher value for lasalocid sodium contents of more than 200 mg/kg.\n7.3. Recovery\nFor the fortified (blank) feed sample, the recovery should be at least 80 %. For the fortified premixture samples, the recovery should be at least 90 %.\n8. Results of a collaborative study\nA collaborative study(1) was arranged in which 2 premixtures (samples 1 and 2) and 5 feeds (samples 3-7) were analysed by 12 laboratories. Duplicate analyses were performed on each sample. The results are given in the following table:\n>TABLE>\nL= number of laboratories\nn= number of single results\nSr= standard deviation of repeatability\nSR= standard deviation of reproducibility\nCVr= coefficient of variation of repeatability, %\nCVR= coefficient of variation of reproducibility, %\n(1) Analyst, 1995, 120, 2175-2180."}
