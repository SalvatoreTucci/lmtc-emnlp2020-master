Those subsectors should therefore be added to the list of sectors or subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage.\n(6) For the subsector \u2018Open die forged ferrous parts for transmission shafts, camshafts, crankshafts and cranks\u2019 this assessment has also shown that it can be clearly distinguished from other subsectors on the basis of specific characteristics and that it satisfies the quantitative criterion set out in point (b) of Article 10a(16) of Directive 2003/87/EC. That subsector should therefore be added to the list of sectors or subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage.\n(7) The sectors \u2018Manufacture of plaster\u2019 and \u2018Manufacture of plaster products for construction purposes\u2019 (NACE codes 2653 and 2662, respectively) have been reassessed in 2012. That qualitative assessment demonstrated challenging market characteristics, such as growing trade, in particular an increasing trend in imports from low-cost manufacturing countries, increased international competitive pressure, and only modest profit margins for the years evaluated, which limit the capacity of installations to invest and reduce emissions. Based on the combined impact of those factors, those sectors should be deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage and added to the list of sectors and subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage.\n(8) Decisions 2010/2/EU and 2011/278/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Decision 2010/2/EU\nThe Annex to Decision 2010/2/EU is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.", "Amendments to Decision 2011/278/EU\nAnnex I to Decision 2011/278/EU is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nConnie HEDEGAARD\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 1, 5.1.2010, p. 10.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 130, 17.5.2011, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe Annex to Decision 2010/2/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Section 2 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following entries are inserted before entry 15331427:\nProdcom Code Description\n\u201815311230 Dried potatoes in the form of flour, meal, flakes, granules and pellets\n15311250 Frozen potatoes, prepared or preserved (including potatoes cooked or partly cooked in oil and then frozen; excluding by vinegar or acetic acid)\u2019\n(b) the following entry is inserted after entry 155154:\nProdcom Code Description\n\u201815515533 Whey and modified whey in powder, granules or other solid forms, whether or not concentrated or containing added sweetening matter\u2019\n(c) the following entry is added after entry 26821620:\nProdcom Code Description\n\u201828401133 Open die forged ferrous parts for transmission shafts, camshafts, crankshafts and cranks\u2019\n(2) in Section 3, the following entries are inserted after entry 2640:\nProdcom Code Description\n\u20182653 Manufacture of plaster\n2662 Manufacture of plaster products for construction purposes\u2019\nANNEX II\nIn Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU, the entries corresponding to product benchmarks \u2018Plaster\u2019, \u2018Dried secondary gypsum\u2019 and \u2018Plasterboard\u2019 are replaced by the following:\nProduct benchmark Definition of products covered Definition of processes and emissions covered (system boundaries) Carbon leakage exposure as determined by Decision 2010/2/EU for the years 2013 and 2014 Benchmark value\n\u2018Plaster Plasters consisting of calcined gypsum or calcium sulphate (including for use in building, for use in dressing woven fabrics or surfacing paper, for use in dentistry, for use in land remediation), in tonnes of stucco.
