Therefore, with a view to avoiding unnecessary disruption in the trade of the foodstuffs concerned, the application of Directive 2004/6/EC should be extended.\n(5) To take into account the time needed for the completion of the evaluation of the substances by the EFSA and for the transposition of the associated measures into the national legislation it is appropriate to provide for an extension of the period of application of Directive 2004/6/EC to 31 December 2009.\n(6) The date of 31 December 2006 provided for in Article 1 of Directive 2004/6/EC makes it necessary that the present Directive should be transposed within a short deadline. In order to avoid difficulties with the trade in products containing the substances listed in Directive 2004/6/EC, it is appropriate for the present directive to apply from 1 January 2007.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Directive 2004/6/EC, the date of \u201831 December 2006\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 8 July 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
