In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products\u00a0(4) (\u2018the Agreement\u2019) provides for the opening of a duty-free Union tariff quota for the import of 4\u00a0600 live bovine animals weighing more than 160\u00a0kg and originating in Switzerland. Detailed rules should be adopted for the opening and administration of this tariff quota on an annual basis.\n(3) For the allocation of that tariff quota and given the products concerned it is appropriate to apply the method of simultaneous examination referred to in Article 144(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(4) To be eligible for the benefit of that tariff quota, the live animals should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement.\n(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the tariff quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in trade of a significant scale with third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the year previous to the annual quota period in question, given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience has shown that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable.\n(6) A security should be fixed for import rights, licences should not be transferable and import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n(7) To provide a more equal access to the tariff quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, maximum and minimum limits should be fixed for the number of animals covered by each application.\n(8) It should be established that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed allocation coefficient applied.\n(9) Pursuant to Article 130 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the arrangements have to be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary in addition to or by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(5), Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector\u00a0(7).\n(10) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that the application should constitute, with regard to the import rights security, a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2012 of 28 March 2012 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(8).\n(11) Experience shows that a proper management of the tariff quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(12) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under this tariff quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 should not apply.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duty-free Union import tariff quota is opened every year for periods from 1 January to 31 December for the import of 4\u00a0600 live bovine animals originating in Switzerland weighing more than 160\u00a0kg, falling within CN codes 0102\u00a029\u00a041, 0102\u00a029\u00a049, 0102\u00a029\u00a051, 0102\u00a029\u00a059, 0102\u00a029\u00a061, 0102\u00a029\u00a069, 0102\u00a029\u00a091, 0102\u00a029\u00a099, ex\u00a00102\u00a039\u00a010 of a weight exceeding 160\u00a0kg or ex\u00a00102\u00a090\u00a091 of a weight exceeding 160\u00a0kg.\nThat tariff quota shall have the order number 09.4203.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rules of origin applicable to the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be those provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, engagement in trade with third countries as referred to in that Article shall mean that applicants have imported at least 50 animals covered by CN code 0102.\nMember States may accept as proof of trade with third countries copies of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, duly certified by the competent authority.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A company formed by the merger of companies each having reference imports complying with the minimum quantity referred to in paragraph 1 may use those reference imports as a basis for its application.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for import rights must cover at least 50 animals and may not cover more than 5\u00a0% of the quantity available.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications for import rights shall be lodged at the latest before 13.00, Brussels time, on 1 December preceding the annual quota period in question.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After verification of the documents presented, Member States shall notify the Commission, by the tenth working day following the end of the period for the submission of applications at the latest, of the total quantities applied for.\nNotwithstanding Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, Article 11 of that Regulation shall apply.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import rights shall be awarded as from the seventh and no later than the sixteenth working day following the end of the period for the notifications referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 3(3).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the application of the allocation coefficient referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 gives a figure of less than 50 head per application, the quantity available shall be awarded by the Member States concerned by drawing lots for import rights covering 50 head each.
