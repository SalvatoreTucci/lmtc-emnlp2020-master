The special circumstances of local natural disaster require an analysis and a decision in good time. Experience shows that to deal appropriately and in due time with local situations it would be appropriate to give to the Member States the responsibility of such decisions, provided that exceptional circumstances justify them.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate that Member States take the decision to recognise severe natural disasters seriously affecting land on holdings in a given region and to authorise all producers affected to use land declared as set aside for animal feed purposes in good time and notify it to the Commission. Member States should notify the Commission of such national decisions and notably of the adverse climatic conditions that justify them.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 is amended as follows:\nIn Article 32 the following paragraph is added:\n\u20185.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases as referred to in Article 40(4) (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States may authorise all producers affected to use land declared as set aside for animal feed purposes for the year of the single application.
