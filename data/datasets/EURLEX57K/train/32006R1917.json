In the interests of greater legibility and simplification for economic operators, Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 should be adapted to take account of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 and it should be stated that Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 and 1301/2006 apply to the import tariff quotas referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003, except where that Regulation provides otherwise.\n(3) It should also be indicated which specific provisions or derogations apply in the case of import tariff quotas managed under an import licence system, and which specific management and administration procedures apply. Thus it is necessary to fix the specific conditions applicable to the forwarding of applications from operators to the Commission, the validity period of the import licences issued, the non-transferable nature of the licences and the issue date for import licences, which must correspond to the date laid down in Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.\n(4) These measures should apply from 1 January 2007, the date from which the measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 apply.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
