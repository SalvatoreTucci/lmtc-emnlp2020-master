DEFINITIONS      1.1. \"Rear-view mirror\" means any device intended to give, within the field of vision geometrically defined in item 2.5 below, a clear view to the rear which, within reasonable limits, is not blocked by component parts of the tractor or by the occupants of the tractor itself.\n1.2. \"Interior rear-view mirror\" means a device as defined in item 1.1 which is fitted inside the cab or frame of a tractor.\n1.3. \"Exterior rear-view mirror\" means a device as defined in item 1.1 which is mounted on any part of the external surface of a tractor.\n1.4. \"Class of rear-view mirror\" means all rear-view mirrors having one or more common characteristics or functions.

Tractors may be fitted with rear-view mirrors of classes I and II only bearing the EEC type-approval mark laid down in Council Directive No 71/127/EEC (1) of 1 March 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the rear-view mirrors of motor vehicles, as amended by the Act of Accession (2).\n2.1.2. Rear-view mirrors must be fixed in such a way that they remain steady under normal driving conditions.\n2.2. Number\nAll tractors shall be equipped with at least one exterior rear-view mirror fitted to the left side of the tractor in Member States in which traffic drives on the right and to the right side of the tractor in Member States in which traffic drives on the left.\n2.3. Position        2.3.1. The exterior rear-view mirror must be so placed that the driver, when sitting on the driving seat in a normal driving position, has a clear view of that part of the road defined in item 2.5.\n2.3.2. The exterior rear-view mirror must be visible through the portion of the windscreen that is swept by the windscreen wiper or through the side windows if the tractor is fitted with them.\n2.3.3. The rear-view mirror must not protrude beyond the external bodywork of the tractor or the tractor-trailer combination substantially more than is necessary to obtain the fields of vision laid down in item 2.5.\n2.3.4. Where the bottom edge of an exterior rear-view mirror is less than 2 m above the ground when the tractor is laden, this rear-view mirror must not project more than 0.20 m beyond the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination measured without rear-view mirrors.\n2.3.5. Subject to the requirements of items 2.3.3 and 2.3.4, rear-view mirrors may project beyond the tractor's permissible maximum width.\n2.4. Adjustment        2.4.1.

Member States in which traffic drives on the right\nThe field of vision of the left hand exterior rear-view mirror must be such that the driver can see to the rear at least that level part of the road as far as the horizon, which is to the left of the plane parallel to the vertical longitudinal median plane and which passes through the leftmost point of the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination.\n2.5.2. Member States in which traffic drives on the left\nThe field of vision of the right hand exterior rear-view mirror must be such that the driver can see to the rear at least that level part of the road, as far as the horizon, which is to the right of the plane parallel to the vertical longitudinal median plane and which passes through the rightmost point of the overall width of the tractor or tractor-trailer combination."}
