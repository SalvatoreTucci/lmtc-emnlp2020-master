whereas, information having been received from the Member States pursuant to Article 15 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1842/81 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3487/81 (5), the coefficients for the periods between 1 August 1973 and 31 July 1981 should be fixed; whereas Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 makes provision for differentiating the coefficient according to the cereals employed;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3233/81 (6) fixed a coefficient for each of the abovementioned periods for barley processed into malt used in the United Kingdom for manufacturing malt whisky; whereas, in view of the additional data recently supplied to the Commission, all the other coefficients for the same periods should be fixed;\nWhereas the second indent of Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 provides for adjustment of the coefficient where foreseeable export trends in one of the Member States concerned show a tendency to change significantly; whereas this assessment may be made by taking account of a sufficiently long reference period to eliminate insignificant short-term fluctuations; whereas a period of six years prior to the year in question complies with this criterion; whereas, moreover, an annual difference of less than 1 % between the respective trends in exports and total quantities sold cannot show a tendency towards significant change;\nWhereas certain coefficients should be adapted accordingly, to take account of a tendency for exports to increase;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81, the coefficients referred to in Article 3 of the said Regulation applicable to cereals used:\n- in the United Kingdom, for the manufacture of grain whisky,\n- in Ireland, for the manufacture of Irish whiskey,\nshall be as shown in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 December 1981.\nFor the Commission\nPoul DALSAGER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 281, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 198, 20. 7. 1981, p. 2.\n(3) OJ No L 121, 5. 5. 1981, p. 3.\n(4) OJ No L 183, 3. 7. 1981, p. 10.\n(5) See page 18 of this Official Journal.\n(6) OJ No L 325, 13. 11. 1981, p. 20.\nANNEX\n1.2,4.5,7 //   //   //   //   //  Coefficients applicable in Ireland  // Coefficients applicable in the United Kingdom  //  // Coefficients applicable  // Coefficients applicable 1.2.3.4.5.6 //   //   //   //   //   //   // Period of application  //  to barley used for the manufacture of Irish whiskey, Category B (1)  // to barley processed into malt used for the manufacture of Irish whiskey, Category A  // to cereals used for the manufacture of Irish whiskey, Category A  // to barley used for the manufacture of grain whisky (1)  // to other cereals used for the manufacture of grain whisky  //  // 1  // 2  // 3  // 4  // 5  //   //   //   //   //   //  // 1. 8. 1973 - 31. 7. 1974  // 0;121  // 0;251  // 0;253  // 0;688  // 0;696  // 1. 8. 1974 - 31. 7. 1975  // 0;198  // 0;418  // 0;413  // 0;666  // 0;678  // 1. 8. 1975 - 31. 7. 1976  // 0;253  // 0;529  // n.d.  // 0;678  // 0;554  // 1. 8. 1976 - 31. 7. 1977  // 0;212  // 0;441  // n.d.  // 0;586  // 0;360  // 1. 8. 1977 - 31. 7. 1978  // 0;241  // 0;499  // n.d.  // 0;452  // 0;103  // 1. 8. 1978 - 31. 7. 1979  // 0;203  // 0;422  // n.d.  // 0;507  // n.d.  // 1. 8. 1979 - 31. 7. 1980  // 0;210  // 0;438  // n.d.  // 0;348  // n.d.  // 1. 8. 1980 - 31. 7. 1981  // 0;239  // 0;409  // n.d.  // 0;503  // 0;052  //   //   //   //   //   //\n(1) Including barley processed into malt.\nn.d. = not determinable;
