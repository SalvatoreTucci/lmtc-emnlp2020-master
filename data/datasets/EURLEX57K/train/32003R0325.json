The rules should therefore be simplified, and the penalty provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 32(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 involving the export-licence security should not be applied in such cases.\n(4) Article 35(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 provides that if the licence is returned to the issuing body within the initial two thirds of its term of validity, the corresponding amount of security to be forfeited is reduced by 40 %, and if the licence is returned during the last third of its term of validity or during the month following the expiry date, the corresponding amount of the security to be forfeited is reduced by 25 %. The mechanism introduced by Article 35(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 is intended to encourage exporters to return unused export licences with advance fixing of the refund to the issuing body rapidly so that export opportunities for agricultural products qualifying for refunds may be used to the full.\n(5) In cases where there is a substantial increase in the refund, application of the mechanism provided for in Article 35(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 could lead to speculation by encouraging exporters not to use their licences and to return them to the issuing body if the difference between the new refund which can be received for the product concerned and the refund fixed in advance for the same product is greater than the amount of security to be forfeited. Appropriate steps should therefore be taken to prevent improper application of that provision.\n(6) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, which sets the maximum quantities of agricultural products for which import or export licences or advance fixing certificates need not be presented under the fourth indent of Article 5(1) of that Regulation, should be updated.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of all the Management Committees concerned,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following subparagraph is added to Article 32(1):\n\"The security shall not be forfeited under the second subparagraph in the case of quantities for which the refund is reduced in accordance with Article 50(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 for failure to meet the deadlines referred to in Article 7(1) and Article 40(1) of that Regulation.\";\n2. the following subparagraphs are added to Article 35(3):\n\"The first subparagraph shall apply unless it is temporarily suspended. Where the refund for one or more products is increased, the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC or the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation of the markets, they may suspend application of the first subparagraph for licences applied for before the refund is increased and not returned to the issuing body until the day before the increase.\nLicences lodged under Article 25 shall be deemed to have been returned to the issuing body on the date on which the latter receives an application from the licence holder for the security to be released.\";\n3. Annex III shall be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to licences applied for from its entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 February 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 11.\n(4) OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p. 12.\n(5) OJ L 152, 24.6.2000, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 308, 27.11.2001, p. 19.\nANNEX\n\"ANNEX III\nMaximum quantities((Maximum quantities of products which may be imported or exported without licences, corresponding to an eight-figure combined-nomenclature (CN) subheading and, in the case of exports with refunds, a 12-figure subheading under the export refund nomenclature for agricultural products.)) of products for which import or export licences or advance fixing certificates need not be presented pursuant to the fourth indent of Article 5(1) (provided import or export does not take place under preferential arrangements subject to a licence ((For example, the quantities indicated in this document do not cover imports under quantitative quotas or preferential arrangements, for which licences are always required for all quantities.
