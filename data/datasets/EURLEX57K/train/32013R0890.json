The logo takes up a 74\u00a0\u00d7 74\u00a0mm square. Below it, on three lines, are set out the words AMARENE BRUSCHE DI MODENA I.G.P. The size of the logo may be adapted in proportion to the different packaging sizes.\nThe wording \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 must be in Italian.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe fruit is grown and \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 PGI jam produced in an area made up of the administrative territory of the municipalities of Bastiglia, Bomporto, Campogalliano, Camposanto, Carpi, Castelfranco Emilia, Castelnuovo Rangone, Castelvetro di Modena, Cavezzo, Concordia sul Secchia, Finale Emilia, Fiorano Modenese, Formigine, Guiglia, Maranello, Marano sul Panaro, Medolla, Mirandola, Modena, Montese, Nonantola, Novi di Modena, Pavullo nel Frignano, Prignano sul Secchia, Ravarino, S. Cesario sul Panaro, S. Felice sul Panaro, S. Possidonio, S. Prospero sul Secchia, Sassuolo, Savignano sul Panaro, Serramazzoni, Soliera, Spilamberto, Vignola and Zocca in the Province of Modena, and the neighbouring parts of the Province of Bologna, limited to the following municipalities: Anzola nell\u2019Emilia, Bazzano, Castel d\u2019Aiano, Castello di Serravalle, Crespellano, Crevalcore, Monte S. Pietro, Monteveglio, San Giovanni in Persiceto, Sant\u2019Agata Bolognese, Savigno and Vergato.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe area in which \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 PGI jam is produced is characterised by very deep soil which is generally fertile and well-structured, fairly porous and permeable, with essentially a silt-loam composition and traces of clay. Hence it is ideally suited to growing sour cherry trees, which need permeable, well-drained and cool ground. The particular structure and texture of the soil mean that it has good porosity and drains well, and therefore that the ground is well aerated. The area in question is criss-crossed by a dense network of natural and man-made waterways. The climate type tends to be sub-humid, and sub-arid in the lower-lying parts of the low plain around Modena; such conditions are particularly conducive to the cultivation of sour cherry trees.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 protected geographical indication differs, in particular, from other products belonging to the same category of goods by virtue of the particular organoleptic and chemical and physical characteristics of the raw material, which in turn come from the variety of sour cherries grown in the area of production, and by virtue, above all, of the characteristic flavour of the jam, which strikes a good balance between sweetness and sourness, with an acidic tinge. Another important distinguishing characteristic is the natural production process, which is based on concentrating the fruit through thermal evaporation without the use of thickeners, colourings or preservatives, the high ratio of fruit to added sugar and the absence of further processing prior to packaging.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe application for recognition of \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 jam as a PGI is justified by the product\u2019s fame and reputation. The jam\u2019s reputation is documented by abundant bibliographical references attesting to the special know-how, passed down over the centuries among the locals, in dealing with the need to process quickly a fruit that does not keep well and creating a product renowned and appreciated especially for the natural way in which it is produced.\nTo illustrate the product\u2019s reputation, one cannot ignore the existence of a production base, in the area delineated under point 4 above, that already at the start of the last century was home to many cherry orchards and centres for the collection and cold storage of cherries, as well as a number of small-scale businesses and small and medium-sized jam producers. Farmers involved in producing the jam make up a pool of over 350 skilled workers and bring considerable production value. The first trials involving the intensive cultivation of cherry trees were conducted in 1882 by Luigi Mancini, a lawyer and owner of the \u2018La Colombarina\u2019 estate near Vignola, although in fact the renowned botanist Giorgio Gallesio recorded as early as 1820 the practice of planting cherry trees around country cottages so that the fruit could be used for making syrups, preserves, jams, puddings and cakes, in line with the solid family tradition of preparing cherries in the rural province of Modena.\nThere are many centuries-old recipes that testify to the use of the product for preparing typical local cakes, both in the home and on a small-scale commercial basis, from the oldest to the most recent, involving the use of the jam for home-made tarts, in particular. Evidence of this can be found in two Modenese manuscripts from the 19th century which explain how to prepare the jam; one of the manuscripts consists of four notebooks kept by four generations of middle-class house-owners and was published in 1970; the other, published in 2001, was written by Ferdinando Cavazzoni, maker of sweetmeats and preserves for the Molza family.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nThe Ministry launched the national objection procedure with the publication of the proposed amendments to the specification for the \u2018Amarene Brusche di Modena\u2019 PGI in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana) No 246 of 20 October 2012.\nThe full text of the product specification is available on the following website: http://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3335\nor alternatively:\nby going directly to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (http://www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (on the top right of the screen) and then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
