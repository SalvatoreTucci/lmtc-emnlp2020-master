whereas, in that case, authorization  should be given only in respect of those matters not covered by Community agreements; whereas, in  addition, such authorization does not absolve the Member States from the obligation of avoiding  and, where appropriate, eliminating any incompatibility between such treaties and agreements and  the provisions of Community law;\nWhereas the provisions of the treaties and agreements to be automatically renewed or maintained in  force must not, furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the  implementation of the common commercial policy;\nWhereas the Member States concerned have stated that the automatic renewal or maintenance in force  of these treaties and agreements should not be such as to constitute an obstacle to the opening of  Community commercial negotiations with the relevant third countries or the transfer of the  commercial fields covered by current bilateral agreements to Community agreements;\nWhereas, at the conclusion of the consultation provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC, it  was established, as the aforesaid statements by the Member States confirm, that the provisions of  the relevant treaties and bilateral agreements will not, during the period under consideration,  constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;\nWhereas, nevertheless, the Member States concerned have stated that they would be willing to adapt  and, if necessary, terminate those treaties and agreements should it be found, during the period  under consideration, that the automatic renewal or maintenance in force of the provisions thereof  relating to matters covered by Article 113 of the Treaty hinders the implementation of the common  commercial policy;\nWhereas the treaties and agreements involved contain termination clauses requiring a period of  notice of between three and 12 months;\nWhereas, therefore, there is no reason for not authorizing the automatic renewal or maintenance in  force, until 30 April 1996, of the provisions in question;\nWhereas the automatic renewal or extension of the treaties and trade agreements between the Member  States and the EFTA countries was considered inappropriate, except for those concluded with  Switzerland and Norway, as the countries concerned have become members of the European Union from 1  January 1995 or are already members of the European Economic Area,", "main_body": ["The provisions governing matters covered by the common commercial  policy within the meaning of Article 113 of the Treaty and contained in the friendship, trade and  navigation treaties and trade agreements listed in the Annex hereto may be automatically renewed or  maintained in force until 30 April 1996 as regards those areas not covered by agreements between  the Community and the third countries concerned in so far as their provisions do not conflict with  existing common policies.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 April 1995.\nFor the Council The President A.
