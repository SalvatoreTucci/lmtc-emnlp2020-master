Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6).\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \"Enzymes\" as set out in the Annex is authorised for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 265, 3.10.2002, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 155, 28.6.2000, p. 15.\n(4) OJ L 289, 28.10.1998, p. 4.\n(5) OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
