The size of the container should also be limited to minimise accidents linked to the transfer from original containers to smaller containers without child-resistant fastenings or appropriate labelling.\n(6) A European Standard for the design of safe decorative lamps was adopted in September 2002 in order to minimise the possibility of small children having access to the oils used in decorative oil lamps (EN 14059). This standard provides a presumption of conformity to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety\u00a0(4). Consumer protection has to be strengthened by requiring compliance with this standard.\n(7) The restrictions on marketing and use laid down by this Decision take into account the current state of knowledge regarding safer alternatives. Member States should periodically report to the Commission on development of alternatives in order to facilitate a review by the European Chemicals Agency. The Agency should assess, on the basis of the effectiveness of the proposed measures to protect child safety, whether it is necessary to adopt additional measures and ban the use of grill lighter fluids and fuel for decorative lamps. For this purpose, the Agency will take into account the requirements of Annex XV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)\u00a0(5).\n(8) Directive 2008/112/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 amending Council Directives 76/768/EEC, 88/378/EEC, 1999/13/EC and Directives 2000/53/EC, 2002/96/EC and 2004/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to adapt them to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures\u00a0(6), imposes obligations on manufacturers of dangerous substances placed on the Community market by 1 December 2010. To facilitate implementation of the additional labelling and packaging provisions included in this Decision, the same date should be imposed on those placing lamp oils and grill lighters on the Community market. In addition, the new risk phrase (H304) required by Directive 2008/112/EC should be used.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 repeals and replaces Directive 76/769/EEC with effect from 1 June 2009. Annex XVII to that Regulation replaces Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC. Any amendment to the restrictions adopted under Directive 76/769/EEC should therefore be incorporated in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n(10) Directive 76/769/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives for the elimination of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended in accordance with the text of the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 May 2009.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0262, 27.9.1976, p.\u00a0201.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0200, 30.7.1999, p.\u00a01.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a011, 15.1.2002, p.\u00a04.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0396, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01; corrected by OJ L\u00a0136, 29.5.2007, p.\u00a03.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0345, 23.12.2008, p.\u00a068.\nANNEX\nPoint 3 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.

Without prejudice to the implementation of other Community provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and mixtures, suppliers shall ensure, before the placing on the market, that the following requirements are met:\n(a) lamp oils, labelled with R65 or H304, intended for supply to the general public are visibly, legibly and indelibly marked as follows:\n(b) grill lighter fluids, labelled with R65 or H304, intended for supply to the general public are legibly and indelibly marked by 1 December 2010 as follows: \u201cJust a sip of grill lighter may lead to life-threatening lung damage\u201d;\n(c) lamp oils and grill lighters, labelled with R65 or H304, intended for supply to the general public are packaged in black opaque containers not exceeding 1 litre by 1 December 2010.\n6.

Natural or legal persons placing on the market for the first time lamp oils and grill lighter fluids, labelled with R65 or H304, shall by 1 December 2011, and annually thereafter, provide data on alternatives to lamp oils and grill lighter fluids labelled R65 or H304 to the competent authority in the Member State concerned.
