This study identified maximum concentration limits for the purpose of Part 2 of Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. Above those limits, risks to human health and the environment could not be excluded.\n(2) The concentration limit for Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDF/PCDD) is expressed in toxic equivalent concentration (TEQ), using the 1998 World Health Organisation toxic equivalency factors (TEFs). Available data on dioxin like Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) is not sufficient to include these compounds in the TEQ.\n(3) Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) is the name of a technical mixture of various isomers. The effort necessary to analyse them completely would be disproportionate. Only alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH are of toxicological relevance. Therefore the concentration limit should refer to them exclusively. Most commercially available analytical standard mixtures for the analyses of this compound class only identify these isomers.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are the most appropriate to ensure a high level of protection.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The Committee established under Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 has not delivered an opinion following its consultation, on 25 January 2006, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17(2) of that Regulation,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 February 2007.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
