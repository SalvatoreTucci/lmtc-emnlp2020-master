whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to open, for the period 16 June 1987 to 14 February 1988, the duty-free tariff quota in question, bearing in mind the obligation to comply with the reference price fixed;\nWhereas equal and continuous access to the said quota should be ensured for all importers and the rate of levy for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the said quota is used up; whereas, in the light of the principles outlined above, a Community tariff arrangement based on an allocation between the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to represent as closely as possible the actual development of the market in the said goods, this allocation should follow proportionately the requirements of the Member States calculated both from statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and according to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, during the last three years for which complete statistics are available, the imports of each Member State represent the following percentages in relation to the total imports of the products in question:\n1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // 1983   // 1984   // 1985   //   //   //   //   // Benelux   // 5,99   // 4,06   // 3,70  // Denmark   // 69,61   // 66.39   // 68,88   // Germany  // 21,94   // 24,44   // 19,30   // Greece   // -   // -  // -   // Spain   // -   // -   // -   // France   // 1,48  // 2,35   // 5,47   // Ireland   // -   // 0,02   // -  // Italy   // -   // 0,02   // -   // Portugal   // -   // -  // -   // United Kingdom   // 0,98   // 2,72   // 2,65   //  //   //   //\nWhereas, in view of the above and of the foreseeable trend of the market for these products in the quota period, the initial quota shares may be as indicated in Articles 2 and 3;\nWhereas, to take account of the possible import trends for this product, the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated between the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial share; whereas, to give importers some degree of certainty, the first part of the tariff quota should be fixed at a high level, which in this case could be 30 000 tonnes;\nWhereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to take account of this fact and to avoid any interruption, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas, each time its additional share is almost used up, a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must, in particular, be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly; Whereas if, at a given date of the quota period, a con- siderable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused, it is essential that such State should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the share allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1. From 16 June 1987 to 14 February 1988, the Common Customs Tariff duty on the following product shall be suspended at the level and within the limit of a Community tariff quota as shown below:\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CCT heading No  // Description  // Quota volume (tonnes)   // Quota duty (%)  //    //   //   //   //   // 09.0005   // 03.01   // Fish, fresh (live or dead), chilled or frozen:   //   //   //   //  // B.

If a Member State, after exhausting its initial share, has used 90 % or more of the second share drawn by it, that Member State shall forthwith, under the conditions set out in paragraph 1, draw a third share equal to 5 % of its initial share, rounded up as necessary to the next whole number. 3. If a Member State, after exhausting its second share, has used 90 % or more of the third share drawn by it, that Member State shall, under the conditions set out in paragraph 1, draw a fourth share equal to the third.\nThis process shall apply until the reserve is used up.\n4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, each Member State may draw shares lower than those specified in those paragraphs if there are grounds for believing that those specified may not be used in full. Any Member State applying this paragraph shall inform the Commission of its grounds for so doing.", "Additional shares drawn pursuant to Article 4 shall be valid until 14 February 1988.", "Member States shall, not later than 15 November 1987, return to the reserve the unused portion of their initial shares which, on 1 November 1987, is in excess of 10 % of the initial volume. They may return a greater portion if there are grounds for believing that it may not be used in full.\nMember States shall, not later than 15 November 1987, notify the Commission of the total quantities of the product in question imported up to and including 1 November 1987 and charged against the Community quota, and of any portion of their initial share returned to the reserve.", "The Commission shall keep an account of the shares opened by the Member States pursuant to Articles 2, 3 and 4 and shall, as soon as the information reaches it, inform each Member State of the extent to which the reserve has been used up.\nIt shall, not later than 20 November 1987, inform the Member States of the amount still in reserve, following any return of shares pursuant to Article 6.\nIt shall ensure that the drawing which exhausts the reserve does not exceed the balance available, and to this end shall notify the amount of that balance to the Member State making the last drawing.", "1. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that additional shares drawn pursuant to Article 4 are opened in such a way that importations may be charged without interruption against their accumulated share of the Community quota.\n2. Member States shall ensure that importers of the product in question have free access to the shares allocated to them.\n3.
