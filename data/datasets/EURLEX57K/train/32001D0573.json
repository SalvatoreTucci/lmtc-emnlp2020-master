Several Member States have notified waste containing chlorosilanes, waste containing silicones and construction materials containing asbestos and requested that the list of hazardous waste be adapted accordingly.\n(3) For the sake of clarity, it should be expressly provided that exclusively grease and oil mixture from oil/water separation containing only edible oil and fats can be considered non-hazardous.\n(4) Decision 2000/532/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion delivered by the Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste [3].
