Those rules should be adapted to technical progress and should take account of developments in relevant international standards, in particular the Codex Standard for fruit juices and nectars (Codex Stan 247-2005) which was adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission during its 28th session on 4-9 July 2005 and the Code of Practice of the European Fruit juice Association (AIJN).\n(2) This Codex Standard establishes in particular quality factors and labelling requirements for fruit juices and similar products. The AIJN Code of Practice also establishes quality factors for fruit juice from concentrate and is internationally used as a reference standard for self-regulation in the fruit juice industry. Directive 2001/112/EC should be brought into line, as far as possible, with these standards.\n(3) This Codex Standard lays down that the product made by reconstituting concentrated fruit juice is described as \u2018fruit juice from concentrate\u2019. The corresponding labelling requirement at Community level should also use these internationally recognised terms. In order to ensure consistency of labelling in all Member States, linguistic versions should be modified where necessary to comply with the Codex wording.\n(4) This Codex Standard and the AIJN code of practice also establish minimum Brix values for a list of fruit juices from concentrate; as these values facilitate the testing for minimum quality requirements, they should be taken into consideration as far as they correspond to the reference values used in the Community.\n(5) Directive 2001/112/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2001/112/EC is amended as follows:\n1. In Article 3, paragraph 6, the words \u2018made with concentrate(s)\u2019 and \u2018partially made with concentrate(s)\u2019 shall be replaced by the words \u2018from concentrate(s)\u2019 and \u2018partially from concentrate(s)\u2019 respectively.\n2.
