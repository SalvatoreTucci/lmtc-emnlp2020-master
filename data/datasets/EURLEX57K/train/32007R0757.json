Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.\n(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of the preservative preparation of sodium benzoate, propionic acid and sodium propionate for cattle for fattening. On 18 October 2006 the European Food Safety Authority delivered its opinion on the safety and efficacy of that preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(6) The use of the preparation of benzoic acid was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 877/2003\u00a0(3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that preparation for pigs for fattening. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.\n(7) The assessment of these applications show that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work\u00a0(4).\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Preservatives\u2019, as specified in Annex I, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The preparation belonging to the group \u2018Acidity regulators\u2019, as specified in Annex II, is authorised without a time limit as an additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 June 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.
