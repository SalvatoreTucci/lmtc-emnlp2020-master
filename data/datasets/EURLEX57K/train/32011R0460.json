Consequently, France has notified to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) in accordance with Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 that it has authorised the placing on the market in its territory of carrots containing pesticide residues higher than the applicable MRL. France also submitted an appropriate risk assessment concluding that such carrots do not constitute an unacceptable risk, in particular that the proposed increased residue level does not lead to a risk for any consumer.\n(3) The Authority assessed the risk assessment submitted by France, examining in particular the risks to the consumer and where relevant to animals. The Authority gave a reasoned opinion on the proposed MRL\u00a0(3). In this opinion the Authority found the proposed MRL acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups.\n(4) Based on the reasoned opinion of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter, it is considered that the proposed MRL fulfils the requirements of Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 16.3.2005, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA scientific report available on http://www.efsa.europa.eu:\nReasoned opinion of EFSA: Modification of the existing MRL for chloranthraniliprole in carrots.
