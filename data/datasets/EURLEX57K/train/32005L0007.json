It is appropriate to specify that the quantitative requirements in relation to the control of substances or products uniformly distributed throughout the feedingstuffs should be applied.\n(3) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised implementation approach in all Member States.\n(4) Directive 2002/70/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annexes to Directive 2002/70/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive 12 months after the entry into force at the latest.
