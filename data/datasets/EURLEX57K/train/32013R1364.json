Detailed rules for the implementation of those requirements are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008\u00a0(2).\n(2) In the period between November 2012 and April 2013 certain Member States submitted requests for revision of the rules about products, substances and techniques which can be used in organic aquaculture production. Those requests are to be evaluated by the expert group for technical advice on organic production set up by Commission Decision 2009/427/EC\u00a0(3); on the basis of that evaluation, the Commission intends to assess the need for any revision of those rules in 2014.\n(3) In some of those requests it was stated that there was insufficient availability of organic juveniles and shellfish seed on the market to comply with the requirements of Articles 25e and 25o of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008.\n(4) As organic juveniles and shellfish seed are not yet available in sufficient quantities, in order to allow for continuity, to avoid disruption of organic aquaculture production in the Union, and to give time to the market for organic juveniles and shellfish seed to develop further, it is justified, pending the receipt of expert advice, to postpone the application of the percentage of 50\u00a0% provided for in Article 25e(3) and the third subparagraph of 25o(1) of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 by one year until 31 December 2014.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.
