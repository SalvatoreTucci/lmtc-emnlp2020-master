whereas in such a situation a reallocation of active substances has to be undertaken; whereas Annexes I and III to Commission  Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (4) should therefore be amended;\nWhereas the number of substances to be reallocated must be limited to the minimum required to ensure a proper balance in the responsibility borne by each of the 15 Member States;\nWhereas, however, the reallocation should also take into account the need to keep substances with similar properties under evaluation by one Member State, as well as the need to ensure that after reallocation all substances are examined by a designated  rapporteur Member State that has authorized the substance;\nWhereas account had also to be taken of indications from certain Member States regarding the advanced stage already reached in the preparation of the evaluation of certain active substances;\nWhereas, to comply with these requirements, it has been necessary to reallocate one substance between Member States of the Community as constituted at 31 December 1994;\nWhereas notifiers of active substances reallocated to another rapporteur Member State must be assured of flexibility with regard to adherence to the deadline set for the introduction of the dossiers, where they can show that the reallocation has led to  a delay in the presentation of the dossiers to the new designated rapporteur Member State;\nWhereas it is necessary to provide that the original rapporteur Member State will transfer to the new designated rapporteur Member State all correspondence and information which it received as rapporteur Member State on the active substance concerned;\nWhereas any producers (that is, manufacturers and importers of substances produced outside the Community) having a permanent office in the territory of one of the acceding Member States must be given the opportunity of participating in the programme in  their own right; whereas this opportunity should however not affect the original timetable for the work;\nWhereas the participation of the notifiers in the programme of work is a long-term exercise, requiring more specific provisions for cases where a notifier decides to withdraw its participation or to agree to a transfer of its participation to another  producer; whereas such transfer may be of particular interest for producers in the acceding Member States that were originally required to participate via a notifier which had its permanent office in one of the 12 Member States before the accessions;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 is amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4, the following paragraph 1a is inserted:\n'1a.
