That plan details the facilities, the necessary equipment and the trained staff to carry out the veterinary checks to verify that Union public and animal health requirements for products of animal origin are met.\n(3) In addition, that plan demonstrates that all consignments of products of animal origin are required to be presented for import at the authorised entry point and that their dispatch into other parts of Union territory is effectively prevented. It also shows that the specific requirements laid down in Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU are met.\n(4) The entry point of the French overseas department of Mayotte should therefore be added to the list of authorised entry points, as regards certain products of animal origin.\n(5) Article 1 and the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(2) In the Annex, the following entry for Mayotte is added after the entry for French Guiana \u2014 St Georges de l'Oyapock in the list of authorised entry points:\n\u2018Mayotte \u2014 Longoni FR09900 P HC, NHC-NT\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 May 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 24.9.1991, p.\u00a056.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a024, 30.1.1998, p.\u00a09.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU of 25 January 2012 on the rules applicable to veterinary checks to be carried out on live animals and products of animal origin entering certain French overseas departments from third countries (OJ L\u00a024, 27.1.2012, p.\u00a014)."}
