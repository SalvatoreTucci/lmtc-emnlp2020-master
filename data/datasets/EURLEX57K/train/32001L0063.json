Annex III is amended as follows:\n(1) in paragraph 2.2.2, the formula shall be replaced by the following: 0,96 &lt;= fa &lt;= 1,06\n(2) in Appendix 2, paragraph 1.2.1, third indent \"CO\" shall be replaced by \"CO2\";\n(3) in Appendix 2, paragraph 1.9.2.2 is replaced by the following: \"1.9.2.2. Water quench check\nThis check applies to wet gas concentration measurements only. Calculation of water quench must consider dilution of the NO span gas with water vapour and scaling of water vapour concentration of the mixture to that expected during testing. A NO span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale to the normal operating range shall be passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D. The NO gas shall then be bubbled through water at room temperature and passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as C. The water temperature shall be determined and recorded as F. The mixture's saturation vapour pressure that corresponds to the bubbler water temperature (F) shall be determined and recorded as G. The water vapour concentration (in %) of the mixture shall be calculated as follows:\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001227EN.004202.TIF\">\nand recorded as H. The expected diluted NO span gas (in water vapour) concentration shall be calculated as follows:\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001227EN.004203.TIF\">\nand recorded as De. For diesel exhaust, the maximum exhaust water vapour concentration (in %) expected during testing shall be estimated, under the assumption of a fuel atom H/C ration of 1,8 to 1, from the maximum CO2 concentration in the exhaust gas or from the undiluted CO2 span gas concentration (A, as measured in section 1.9.2.1) as follows:\nHm = 0,9 x A\nand recorded as Hm.\nThe water quench shall be calculated as follows:\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001227EN.004204.TIF\">\nand must not be greater than 3 % of full scale.\nDe: expected diluted NO concentration (ppm)\nC: diluted NO concentration (ppm)\nHm: maximum water vapour concentration (%)\nH: actual water vapour concentration (%)\nNB:\nIt is important that the NO span gas contains minimal NO2 concentration for this check, since obsorption of NO2 in water has not been accounted for in the quench calculations.\"\n(4) in Appendix 3, paragraph 1.4.4, the second formula for single filter particulate mass flow background correction is deleted and the first formula is amended as follows;\n>PIC FILE= \"L_2001227EN.004205.TIF\">\n2.
