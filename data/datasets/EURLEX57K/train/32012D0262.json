Pending the entry into force of that regulation it is appropriate to address the possible misreporting reported by ICES.\n(6) To address the possible misreporting in the fisheries exploiting the Baltic Sea salmon stocks, it is appropriate to include those stocks in this specific control and inspection programme.\n(7) Decision 2008/589/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision have been established in concert with the Member States concerned.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Decision 2008/589/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the title is replaced by the following:\n2.
