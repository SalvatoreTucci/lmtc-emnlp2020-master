However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\n(5) in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\n(6) aloe vera gel and whole leaf extract of aloe vera should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\n(7) an adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\n(8) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Annex II of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the 60th day following its publication.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nErkki LIIKANEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 1.\n(2) See page 45 of this Official Journal.\n(3) OJ L 317, 6.11.1981, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 31.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended as follows:\n6.
