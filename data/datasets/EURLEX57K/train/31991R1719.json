During the 1989/90, 1990/91 and 1991/92 marketing years, a marketing premium for the import of raw preferential cane sugar refined into white sugar during that period in the refineries referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 9 (4) of  Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 shall be granted as an intervention measure.\n2.  The premium referred to in paragraph 1 may be granted only in respect of the quantities laid down in the Protocol and the Agreement that have been imported and only if the premium is reassigned by the importer to the producer of the preferential  sugar in question.\n3.  The premium referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined per 100 kilograms of white sugar for each marketing year taking account of a total appropriation of ECU 30 million for the three marketing years referred to in paragraph 1.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 1989.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 13 June 1991.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
