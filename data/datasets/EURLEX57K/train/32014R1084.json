These doughs should not raise under cooling conditions, but the raising should be activated during the final preparation by the consumer. Sodium bicarbonate is mainly responsible for the raising, while yeast with low raising activities is particularly needed to develop the typical aromatic taste. The diphosphates are required as acidity regulators in order to control the carbon dioxide formation from the sodium bicarbonate.\n(5) Such a raising system based on sodium bicarbonate, diphosphates and yeast can be used as an alternative to the use of self-raising flour in which higher levels of phosphates are authorised. The authorisation of the use of diphosphates in prepared yeast based doughs will thus not result in an increase of intake of phosphates. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of diphosphates as a raising agent and acidity regulator in yeast based doughs used as basis for pizzas, quiches, tarts and similar products.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of the use of diphosphates as acidity regulator in yeast based doughs used as basis for pizza's, quiches, tarts and similar products is not considered of safety concern, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(7) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (OJ L\u00a0354, 31.12.2008, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, in category 07.1 \u2018Bread and rolls\u2019, the following entry is inserted after the entry for food additive E 338-452:\n\u2018E 450 Diphosphates 12\u00a0000 (4) only refrigerated, prepacked yeast based doughs used as basis for pizzas, quiches, tarts and similar products\u2019"}
