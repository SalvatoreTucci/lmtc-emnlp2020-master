This Regulation lays down the formalities and controls required for goods that cross internal frontiers of the Community accompanied by an ATA carnet, a Community movement carnet or the form 302 laid down under the Convention between the  parties to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Status of their Forces, signed in London on 19 June 1951.\n2.
