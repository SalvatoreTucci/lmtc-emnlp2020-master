(2)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 1.\nStates may lay down supplementary conditions or limitations on the granting of compensatory allowances;\nWhereas the abovementioned statutory instruments already essentially comply with the aims and conditions of Directive 75/268/EEC;\nWhereas, however they fail to provide that farmers receiving the compensatory allowance should give the undertaking referred to in Article 6 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC to pursue a farming activity for at least five years ; whereas, in addition, for England and Wales and for Northern Ireland they also permit the compensatory allowance in a few cases to be slightly higher than 50 units of account per hectare under forage;\nWhereas, pursuant to the second sentence of Article 5 and Article 17 of Directive 75/268/EEC, the abovementioned statutory instruments must, on both these points, be amended to comply with this Directive within one year from the date on which the Directive came into effect ; whereas the abovementioned draft statutory instrument on stock breeding on hill land (compensatory allowances) 1975 already provides for the corresponding amendments;\nWhereas, so far as the undertaking in Article 6 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC is concerned, it is possible to restrict the financial contribution of the Community to those cases where the recipients of the subsidies give such an undertaking on the occasion of the granting of compensatory allowances in 1976;\nWhereas, so far as the possible excess of the maximum amount of the compensatory allowance over that laid down in Article 7 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC of 50 units of account per hectare is concerned in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, such excess is very insignificant;\nWhereas therefore subject to the necessary adjustments being made in 1976, although this excess is not compatible with the Directive, a financial contribution by the Community to the cost of the statutory instruments referred to above for 1975 can be held to be justified, bearing in mind the transitional period allowed by Article 17 of the Directive;\nWhereas the EAGGF Committee has been consulted on the financial aspects;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures,", "main_body": ["The statutory instruments forwarded by the Government of the United Kingdom on 22 October 1975 and referred to individually in the preamble satisfy the conditions for a financial contribution by the Community in 1975 to the measures referred to in Article 13 of Directive 75/268/EEC and Article 15 of Directive 72/159/EEC.", "The EAGGF Guidance Section shall contribute to the financing of the following subsidies:    - those which were granted in 1975 to farmers who, on the occasion of the granting of a compensatory allowance in 1976 give the undertaking in Article 6 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC;\n- those which in England and Wales and Northern Ireland do not exceed the maximum amount of 50 units of account per livestock unit and per hectare under forage permitted by Article 7 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the same day as the Commission Decision on the measures applied in the United Kingdom in 1976 to implement Title II of Directive 75/268/EEC.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 March 1976.\nFor the Commission\nP.J.
