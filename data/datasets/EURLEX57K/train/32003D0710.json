The National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of Sapard.\n(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted the Decision 2001/857/EC of 26 November 2001 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Lithuania in the preaccession period(5) with regard to certain measures provided for in Sapard.\n(5) The Commission has undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of measure 5 \"Afforestation of agricultural lands and improvement of forest infrastructure\" and measure 8 \"Technical assistance, information and publicity campaigns\", as provided for in Sapard. The Commission considers that, also with regard to those measures, the Republic of Lithuania complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the preaccession period(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 188/2003(7), and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer, with regard to measure 5 and measure 8, on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance in the Republic of Lithuania, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.\n(7) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission for measure 5 and measure 8 are based on a system that is not yet fully operating with regard to all relevant elements, it is therefore appropriate to confer the management of Sapard on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.\n(8) Full conferral of management of Sapard is only envisaged after further verifications, in order to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily, have been carried out and after any recommendations the Commission may issue, with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance, have been implemented.\n(9) On 14 July 2003, the Lithuanian Authorities proposed the rules for eligibility of expenditure in accordance with Article 4(1) of section B of the Multiannual Financing Agreement.
