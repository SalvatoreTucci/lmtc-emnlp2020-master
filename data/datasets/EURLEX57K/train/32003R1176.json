However, owing to the very small number of organoleptic attributes set out in the said Annex, operators are encountering difficulties in describing the organoleptic characteristics on the labels of their oil.\n(3) As there is no objective method at present of verifying certain organoleptic characteristics that greatly enhance virgin olive oils as regards flavour, aroma and colour, such attributes cannot appear on the labels. Moreover, the positive organoleptic attributes listed in Annex XII to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 cannot cover the full range of olive varieties or tastes of virgin olive oils.\n(4) In view of the fact that research into new organoleptic evaluation methods aimed at widening the range of positive attributes of virgin olive oils is still under way, and in order to give the bodies in charge of developing new more comprehensive methods sufficient time to establish such methods, the date on which Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 is to apply should be postponed by one year.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 is replaced by the following:\n\"2.
