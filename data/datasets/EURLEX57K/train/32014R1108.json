That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, and by the relevant data to support its requests.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation of Clostridium butyricum (FERM BP-2789) as a feed additive for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of the preparation of Clostridium butyricum (FERM BP-2789), belonging to the additive category of \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019, was authorised for 10\u00a0years as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 903/2009\u00a0(2) and for minor avian species (excluding laying birds) and for weaned piglets and minor porcine species (weaned) by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0373/2011\u00a0(3).\n(5) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 4 March 2014\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Clostridium butyricum (FERM BP-2789) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health and the environment. It also concluded that the additive has the potential to improve performance in turkeys for fattening and that this conclusion can be extended to turkeys reared for breeding. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of Clostridium butyricum (FERM BP-2789) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed.", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 903/2009 of 28 September 2009 concerning the authorisation of the preparation of Clostridium butyricum FERM-BP 2789 as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co.
