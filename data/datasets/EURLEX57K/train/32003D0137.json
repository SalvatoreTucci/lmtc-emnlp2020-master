The situation should be reviewed when the Paraguayan authorities can give sufficient guarentees that the deficiencies found have been rectified and this has been positively assessed by a further FVO inspection.\n(8) Decision 93/402/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Decision 93/402/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "The Member States shall amend the measures they apply to imports so as to bring them into compliance with this Decision and they shall give immediate appropriate publicity to the measures adopted.
