Several Member States have used this specific support measure.\n(2) However, the fact that Member States may modify transfers to the single payment scheme from the support programmes once a year and that support programmes have a five-year duration whilst payment entitlements giving rise to direct payments are granted for an indeterminate period of time has resulted in administrative and budgetary burdens.\n(3) In order to simplify the management of this specific support measure and to ensure its consistency with the objectives of the rules for direct support schemes for farmers, it is appropriate to convert it into the possibility for Member States to definitively decrease the funds allocated to the support programmes in the wine sector and thereby increase the national ceilings for direct payments.\n(4) It is appropriate to allow Member States to continue applying the support provided for in Article 103o of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 for 2014.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 103n, the following paragraph is inserted:\n(2) Article 103o is replaced by the following:\n(a) remain in the single payment scheme and no longer be available under Article 103k(3) for the measures listed in Articles 103p to 103y;\n(b) reduce proportionately the amount of funds available for measures listed in Articles 103p to 103y in the support programmes.\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 25 October 2012.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
