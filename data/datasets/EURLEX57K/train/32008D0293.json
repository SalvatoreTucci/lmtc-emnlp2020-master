Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cCSB Image-Meater\u201d.\n2. The CSB Image-Meater consists in particular in a video camera, a PC equipped with an image-analysis card, a screen, a printer, a command mechanism, a rate mechanism and interfaces. The 11 Image-Meater variables are all measured at the split line: the measured values are transformed into an estimation of the lean meat percentage by a central unit.\n3.

Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cVCS 2000\u201d.\n2. The VCS 2000 is based on digital video image analysis. The major components are three cameras, lamps, an image-analysis computer, a server PC and positioning units. At the first station one camera takes an image of the external side of the ham. At the second station two cameras take images on the split line. From the images, 40 variables are extracted. These variables are mainly depths, widths, lengths and areas. The measured values are transformed into an estimation of the lean meat percentage by a central unit.\n3. The lean meat content of carcases shall be calculated on the basis of 40 variables according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = 122,458 + 0,05805 * X1 + 0,01449 * X2 \u2013 0,02996 * X3 \u2013 0,001585 * X4 \u2013 39,297 * X5 \u2013 47,553 * X6 + 38,877 * X7 \u2013 0,1013 * X8 + 0,00004308 * X9 \u2013 817,242 * X10 + 10,135 * X11 + 15,277 * X12 \u2013 25,777 * X13 \u2013 90,738 * X14 + 0,0005792 * X15 + 2,743 * X16 \u2013 0,06866 * X17 + 3,511 * X18 \u2013 0,1681 * X19 \u2013 0,007867 * X20 \u2013 0,1082 * X21 \u2013 0,01290 * X22 + 0,02957 * X23 + 0,03856 * X24 \u2013 0,003353 * X25 \u2013 0,03378 * X26 \u2013 0,01661 * X27 + 2,368 * X28 \u2013 0,3133 * X29 \u2013 0,01386 * X30 \u2013 0,02100 * X31 \u2013 0,01908 * X32 \u2013 0,02442 * X33 + 0,06009 * X34 \u2013 0,007792 * X35 \u2013 2,598 * X36 \u2013 7,632 * X37 \u2013 0,004848 * X38 \u2013 0,9099 * X39 \u2013 20,514 * X40"}
