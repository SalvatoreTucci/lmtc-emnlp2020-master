Classification of the product under Chapter 19 is therefore excluded.\n(2) In the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 17 December 2009 in joined cases C-410/08 to C-412/08, Swiss Caps\u00a0(3), and in particular paragraph 33, classification of edible goods intended to be used as food supplements under heading 2106 of the CN can be envisaged only if the food preparations in question are not specified or included elsewhere. Food preparations intended to be used as food supplements may therefore be classified under other headings of the CN where the description of those headings is more specific.\n(3) As a consequence, the presentation and use of an edible product as a food supplement cannot be the reason for the exclusion from Chapter 19 of the CN. It is therefore necessary to state that the reason why the product does not meet the requirements of Note 2(b)(2) of Chapter 19 of the CN lies solely in its composition.\n(4) The reasons set out in the second paragraph of column (3) of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 42/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly. However, for reasons of clarity the whole Annex to Regulation (EU) No 42/2010 should be replaced.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 42/2010 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX\nDescription of goods Classification Reasons\n(1) (2) (3)\nProduct consisting of (% by weight):\n\u2014 barley grass, powdered 28,8\n\u2014 honey 27,5\n\u2014 wheatgrass, powdered 21,5\n\u2014 alfalfa, powdered 21,5\n\u2014 stearic acid 0,4\n\u2014 pepper 0,25\n\u2014 chromium picolinate 0,01", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 2012.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a012, 19.1.2010, p.\u00a02.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0[2010] ECR I - 11991."}
