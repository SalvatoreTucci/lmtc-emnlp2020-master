'Municipal waste-incineration plant' shall mean any technical equipment used for the treatment of municipal waste by incineration, with or without recovery of the combustion heat generated, but excluding plants used specifically for the incineration of sewage sludge, chemical, toxic and dangerous waste, medical waste from hospitals or other types of special waste, on land or at sea, even if these plants may burn municipal waste as well.\nThis definition covers the site and the entire installation comprising the incinerator, its waste, fuel and air-supply systems and the devices and systems for checking incineration operations and continuously recording and monitoring incineration conditions.\n5. 'Existing municipal waste-incineration plant' shall mean a municipal waste-incineration plant for which the first authorization to operate is granted before 1 December 1990.\n6. 'Nominal capacity of the incineration plant' shall mean the sum of the incineration capacities of the furnaces of which the plant is composed, as specified by the constructor and confirmed by the operator, with due account being taken, in particular, of the calorific value of the waste, expressed as the quantity of waste incinerated per hour.", "In accordance with Article 13 of Directive 84/360/EEC, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the operation of existing municipal waste-incineration plants are subject:\n(a) in the case of plants with a nominal capacity equal to or more than 6 tonnes of waste per hour: by 1 December 1996, to the same conditions as those imposed on new incineration plants of the same capacity under the terms of Council Directive 89/369/EEC of 8 June 1989 on the prevention of air pollution from new municipal waste-incineration plants (1), except with regard to the provisions of Article 4, which shall be replaced by those of Article 4 of this Directive;\n(b) in the case of other plants:\n(i) by 1 December 1995, to the conditions laid down by Articles 3 to 7 of this Directive;\n(ii) by 1 December 2000, to the same conditions as those imposed on new incineration plants of the same capacity under the terms of Directive 89/369/EEC, except with regard to the provisions of Article 4, which shall be replaced by those of Article 4 of this Directive.\nThe competent authorities shall see to it that any adaptation of existing plants, as decided upon on the basis of their remaining life span and of the time limits and conditions laid down by this Directive, is carried out as soon as possible.", "1.

In regard to plants with a capacity of less than one tonne per hour, the emission limit values may refer to an oxygen level of 17 %. In this case, the concentration values may not exceed those laid down in paragraph 1, divided by 2,5.\n3. The competent authorities shall lay down emission limit values for pollutants other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 when they consider this to be appropriate because of the composition of the waste to be incinerated and of the characteristics of the incineration plant. For the purposes of laying down these emission limit values, the authorities shall take account of the potential harmful effects of the pollutants in question on human health and the environment and of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs. In particular, the competent authorities may fix emission limit values for dioxins and furans.", "1.

The sampling and measurement procedures, methods and equipment used to satify the obligations imposed by paragraph 1 and the location of the sampling or measurement points shall require the prior approval of the competent authorities.\n5. For the periodic measurements, the competent authorities shall lay down appropriate measurement programmes to ensure that the results are representative of the normal level of emissions of the substances concerned.\nThe results obtained must be suitable for verifying that the limit values applicable have been observed.", "1. Should the measurements taken show that the limit values laid down in this Directive have been exceeded, the competent authority shall be informed as soon as possible. It shall ensure that the plant concerned does not continue to operate while failing to comply with emission standards and shall take the necessary measures to ensure it is modified or no longer operated.\n2. The competent authorities shall lay down the maximum permissible period of any technically unavoidable stoppages of the purification devices during which the concentrations in the discharges into the air of the substances which these devices are intended to reduce exceed the limit values laid down. In case of a breakdown the operator shall reduce or close down operations as soon as practicable and until normal operations can be restored. Under no circumstances may the plant continue to operate more than 16 hours uninterrupted; moreover the cumulative duration over a year of operation in such conditions shall be less than 200 hours.\nThe dust content of the discharges shall under no circumstances exceed 600 mg/nm3 during the periods referred to in the preceding subparagraqph and all the other conditions, in particular the combustion conditions, shall be complied with.
