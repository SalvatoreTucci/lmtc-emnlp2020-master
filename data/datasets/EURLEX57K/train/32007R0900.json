Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.\n(5) In view of the specific nature of the operation, appropriate provisions should be laid down with regard to export licences issued in connection with the standing invitation to tender, in particular as regards the deadline for the issue of the licences, their period of validity, the amount of the security and the quantity for which the obligation to export resulting from the licence is met. However, Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(2) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 120/89 of 19 January 1989 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products\u00a0(3) must continue to apply.\n(6) The provisions of this Regulation replace, as regards the partial invitations to tender as from August 2007, those of Commission Regulation (EC) No 958/2006 of 28 June 2006 on a standing invitation to tender to determine refunds on exports of white sugar for the 2006/2007 marketing year\u00a0(4). For the sake of transparency and legal clarity, therefore, that Regulation should be repealed with effect from 1 August 2007.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A standing invitation to tender shall be opened in order to determine export refunds on white sugar covered by CN code 1701\u00a099\u00a010 for all destinations excluding Andorra, Gibraltar, Ceuta, Melilla, the Holy See (Vatican City State), Liechtenstein, Communes of Livigno and Campione d'Italia, Heligoland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, the areas of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia\u00a0(5), Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
