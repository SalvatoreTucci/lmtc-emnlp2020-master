For the sake of clarity, new detailed rules for the implementation of those requirements should be laid down. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1868/77\u00a0(3), which lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75, should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 laid down certain rules for the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks. The implementation of these rules requires rules of application aimed, inter alia, at preventing the marketing of eggs removed from the incubator unless they have a special distinguishing mark, at specifying the markings to be made on eggs and the packaging of eggs for hatching and chicks, and providing for communication of the necessary information.\n(6) Each establishment should be given a distinguishing registration number based on a code drawn up in each Member State so that it is possible to determine the activity in which the establishment is engaged.\n(7) The collection system for data concerning intra-Community trade in and production of chicks and eggs for hatching should be adequately maintained in order to establish short-term production estimates. It is for each Member State to lay down the penalties for infringements of these provisions.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1. \u2018eggs for hatching\u2019 means poultry eggs falling within subheadings 0407\u00a000\u00a011 and 0407\u00a000\u00a019 of the Combined Nomenclature intended for the production of chicks, classified according to species, category and type and identified in accordance with this Regulation, produced in the Community or imported from third countries;\n2. \u2018chicks\u2019 means live farmyard poultry the weight of which does not exceed 185 grammes, either produced in the Community or imported from third countries and falling within subheadings 0105\u00a011 and 0105\u00a019 of the Combined Nomenclature, of the following categories:\n(a) utility chicks: chicks of one of the following types:\n(i) table type chicks: chicks intended to be fattened and slaughtered before reaching sexual maturity;\n(ii) laying chicks: chicks intended to be raised with a view to the production of eggs for consumption;\n(iii) dual-purpose chicks: chicks intended either for laying or for the table;\n(b) parent stock chicks: chicks intended for the production of utility chicks;\n(c) grandparent stock chicks: chicks intended for the production of parent stock chicks;\n3. \u2018establishment\u2019 means the establishment or part of an establishment for each of the following sectors of activity:\n(a) pedigree breeding establishment: an establishment for the production of eggs for hatching intended for the production of grandparent stock, parent stock or utility chicks;\n(b) breeding establishment: an establishment for the production of eggs for hatching intended for the production of utility chicks;\n(c) hatchery: an establishment for incubating eggs, hatching and supplying chicks;\n4. \u2018capacity\u2019 means the maximum number of eggs for hatching which may be placed simultaneously in incubators excluding hatchers.", "Registration of establishments\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every establishment shall be registered, at its request, by the competent agency appointed by the Member State and shall receive a distinguishing number.\nThe distinguishing number may be withdrawn from establishments which do not comply with the provisions of this Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All applications for registration of one of the establishments referred to in paragraph 1 shall be addressed to the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the establishment is located.
