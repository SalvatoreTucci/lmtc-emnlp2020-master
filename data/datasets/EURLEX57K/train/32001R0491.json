It lays down in particular that Articles 1 and 3 of, and the Annex to, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 of 28 June 1984 authorising the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 337/79(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2839/98(6), should remain in force until 31 January 2001. However, Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 stipulates that these provisions would remain in force until 31 December 2003. Under Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Commission presented a proposal for a Council regulation authorising until 31 December 2003 the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, which applies similar provisions on the same terms as those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84. However, it seems likely that the Council will not be able to adopt this proposal before 31 January 2001. To enable the Council to adopt this proposal without interrupting the status quo where the products referred to in Articles 1 and 3 of, and the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 are concerned, these provisions should be maintained until the Council takes a decision, or until 31 December 2003 at the latest. This Regulation must apply from 1 February 2001 for the same reason.\n(2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council, since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1608/2000 is amended as follows:\n1. The following sentence is added to Article 1:\"The provisions listed in Part C of the Annex shall remain applicable until such time as the Council adopts the Commission proposal for a Council regulation authorising the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and until 31 December 2003 at the latest.\"\n2.
