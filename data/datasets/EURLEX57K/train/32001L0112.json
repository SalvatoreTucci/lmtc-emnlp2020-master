It should be clearly indicated when a product is a mixture of fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate, and, for fruit nectar, when it is obtained entirely or partly from a concentrated product. The list of ingredients in the labelling bears the names of both the fruit juices and fruit juices from concentrate used.\n(8) Subject to Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs(7), the addition of vitamins to the products defined by this Directive is permitted in some Member States. However, the extension of this possibility to the whole of the Community is not envisaged. Therefore, Member States are free to authorise or prohibit the addition of vitamins and also minerals as part of the manufacturing process. In all circumstances, however, the principle of the free movement of products within the Community should be observed in accordance with the rules and principles laid down in the Treaty.\n(9) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of laying down common definitions and rules for the products concerned and bringing the provisions into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the nature of this Directive, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.\n(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).\n(11) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,", "main_body": ["This Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.", "Member States may, subject to Directive 90/496/EEC, authorise the addition of vitamins and minerals to the products defined in part I of Annex I hereto.", "Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Annex I, subject to the following conditions:\n1.

These designations may be used in the language and under the conditions laid down in Annex III.\n2. If the product comes from a single kind of fruit, the name of the latter shall be substituted for the word \"fruit\".\n3. For products manufactured from two or more fruits, except where lemon juice is used under the conditions laid down in part II.1 of Annex I, the product names shall be supplemented by a list of the fruits used, in descending order of the volume of the fruit juices or pur\u00e9es included. However, in the case of products manufactured from three or more fruits, the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words \"several fruits\" or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used.\n4.

That information shall be entered close to the product name, standing out well from any background, in clearly visible characters.\n7.

(a) Fruit juice\nThe fermentable but unfermented product obtained from fruit which is sound and ripe, fresh or preserved by chilling, of one or more kinds mixed together, having the characteristic colour, flavour and taste typical of the juice of the fruit from which it comes. Flavour, pulp and cells from the juice which are separated during processing may be restored to the same juice.\nIn the case of citrus fruits, the fruit juice must come from the endocarp. Lime juice, however, may be obtained from the whole fruit, by suitable production processes whereby the proportion of constituents of the outer part of the fruit is reduced to a minimum.\n(b) Fruit juice from concentrate\nThe product obtained by replacing in the concentrated fruit juice water extracted from that juice during concentration, and restoring the flavours, and, if appropriate, pulp and cells lost from the juice but recovered during the process of producing the fruit juice in question or of fruit juice of the same kind. The water added must display appropriate characteristics, particularly from the chemical, microbiological and organoleptic viewpoints, in such a way as to guarantee the essential qualities of the juice.\nThe product thus obtained must display organoleptic and analytical characteristics at least equivalent to those of an average type of juice obtained from fruits of the same kind within the meaning of (a).\n2. Concentrated fruit juice\nThe product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of a specific proportion of the water content. Where the product is intended for direct consumption that removal will be of at least 50 %.\n3. Dehydrated/powdered fruit juice\nThe product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of virtually all the water content.\n4. Fruit nectar\n(a) The fermentable but unfermented product obtained by adding water and sugars and/or honey to the products defined in points 1, 2 and 3, to fruit puree or to a mixture of those products, that product, moreover, meeting the requirements of Annex IV.\nThe addition of sugars and/or honey is permitted up to 20 % of the total weight of the finished product.\nWhere fruit nectars are manufactured without added sugar or with low energy value, sugars may be replaced wholly or partially by sweeteners, in accordance with Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs(1).\n(b) By way of derogation from (a), fruits listed in parts II and III of Annex IV and apricots can be used, individually or mixed together, to manufacture nectars without the addition of sugar, honey and/or sweeteners.\nII. AUTHORISED INGREDIENTS, TREATMENTS AND SUBSTANCES\n1. Authorised ingredients\n- Pursuant to Article 2, the addition of vitamins and minerals may be authorised in the case of the products defined in Part I, subject to Directive 90/496/EEC.\n- Flavour, pulp and cells restored to fruit juice defined in part I.1(a) must have been separated from that juice during processing, whereas flavour, pulp and cells restored to fruit juice defined in part I.1(b) may also be from fruit juice of the same kind.\nFor grape juice only, salts of tartaric acids may be restored.\n- For products defined in part I.1, 2 and 3, other than pear or grape juice, the addition of sugars is authorised\n- for regulating acidic taste, the quantity of sugars added, expressed as dry matter, may not exceed 15 g per litre of juice,\n- for sweetening purposes, the quantity of sugars added, expressed as dry matter, may not exceed 150 g per litre of juice\nprovided that the total amount of sugar added for both regulating acidic taste and sweetening purposes may not exceed 150 g per litre.\n- For products defined in part I.1, 2, 3 and 4, in order to regulate acidic taste, the addition of lemon juice and/or concentrated lemon juice up to 3 g per litre of juice, expressed as anhydrous citric acid, is authorised.\n- Carbon dioxide, as an ingredient, is authorised.\nThe addition of both sugars and lemon juice, whether concentrated or not, or acidifying agents as permitted by Directive 95/2/EC to the same fruit juice is prohibited.\n2. Authorised treatments and substances\n- Mechanical extraction processes.\n- The usual physical processes, including in-line water extraction (diffusion) of the edible part of fruits other than grapes for the manufacture of concentrated fruit juices, provided that the concentrated fruit juices thus obtained comply with part I.1. The use of certain processes and treatments may be limited or prohibited in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8(2).\n- For grape juice, where sulfitation with sulphur dioxide of the grapes has been used, desulfitation by physical means is authorised, provided that the total quantity of SO2 present in the final product does not exceed 10 mg/l.\n- Pectolytic enzymes.\n- Proteolytic enzymes.\n- Amylolytic enzymes.\n- Edible gelatine.\n- Tannins.\n- Bentonite.\n- Silicon aerogel.\n- Charcoal.\n- Chemically inert filtration adjuvant and precipitation agents (e.g. perlite, washed diatomite, cellulose, insoluble polyamide, polyvinylpolypyrolidon, polystyrene), which comply with the Community Directives on materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.\n- Chemically inert adsorption adjuvants which comply with the Directives on materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, and which are used to reduce the limonoid and naringin content of citrus juice without significantly affecting the limonoid glucosides, acid, sugars (including oligosaccharides) or mineral content.\n(1) OJ L 237, 10.9.1994, p. 3.
