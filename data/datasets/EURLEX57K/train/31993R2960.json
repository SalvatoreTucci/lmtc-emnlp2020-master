whereas the quantity put on the market during October and from 1 March to 15 May of the following year  represents only a small percentage of that marketed over the whole marketing year; whereas the reference price should therefore be fixed only for the period running from 1 November to the last day of February of the following year;\nWhereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:\n- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and\n- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;\nWhereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State with regard to Article 23 (2) plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production  costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;\nWhereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;\nWhereas Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 of 28 December 1992 on transitional measures for the application of the agrimonetary arrangements laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (6) establishes a correspondence between the  provisions of the agrimonetary arrangements applicable from 1 January 1993 and those applicable before that date;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 establishes a list of prices and amounts for the fruit and vegetables sector which are to be divided by a coefficient of 1,010495 fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 537/93 (7), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1331/93 (8),  as from the beginning of the 1993/94 marketing year; whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 lays down that the resulting reduction in the prices and amounts for each sector concerned shall be specified and the level of such reduced prices  fixed; whereas, however, this adjustment may not result in a reference price level below that of the preceding marketing year, in accordance with Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 1993/94 marketing year, the reference price for fresh mandarins including tangerines and satsumas, wilkings and other similar citrus hybrids, with the exception of clementines (CN codes ex 0805 20 30, ex 0805 20 50, ex 0805 20 70 and  ex 0805 20 90), expressed in ecus per 100 kilograms net of packed products quality class I, of all sizes, shall be:\nfrom 1 November 1993 to 28 February 1994: 27,64.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 November 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 October 1993.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 69, 20. 3. 1993, p. 7.\n(3) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 29.\n(5) OJ No L 158, 30. 6. 1993, p. 18.\n(6) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 22.\n(7) OJ No L 57, 10. 3. 1993, p. 18.\n(8) OJ No L 132, 29. 5. 1993, p. 114."}
