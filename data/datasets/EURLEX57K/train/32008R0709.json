In order to enable the tobacco sector to continue to function properly and in the interest of clarity and rationalisation a new Regulation should be adopted laying down those provisions as well as the current implementing rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No\u00a086/93 of 19\u00a0January 1993 on detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No\u00a02077/92 concerning inter-branch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector\u00a0(3).\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No\u00a086/93 should therefore be repealed.\n(4) Interbranch organisations established by individuals or groups, and representing a significant proportion of the various categories involved in production, processing and marketing in the tobacco sector are likely to contribute to better account being taken of the market situation and encourage changes in economic behaviour intended to improve knowledge and organisation of production, processing and marketing. Some of their activities may contribute to improvement of the market balance and therefore help to achieve the objectives laid down in Article\u00a033 of the Treaty. The measures which may constitute such a contribution by the interbranch organisations should be defined.\n(5) In view of the above, it is appropriate to grant specific recognition to bodies which can demonstrate their proven representativeness at regional, inter-regional or Community level and which take positive action in pursuit of the above mentioned objectives. Such recognition should be granted by the Member State or by the Commission, depending on the scope of the activities of the trade association.\n(6) In order to support certain activities of interbranch organisations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organisation for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an interbranch organisation for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions. Non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities. This procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer.\n(7) Other activities of the recognised interbranch organisations may be of general economic or technical interest for the tobacco sector and so be of benefit to all persons active in the branches in question, whether or not they are members of the organisation. In such cases it appears reasonable to make non-members liable to pay the subscriptions intended to cover the costs, other than administrative costs, arising directly from performance of the activities in question.\n(8) In order to ensure correct operation of the scheme, there should be close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission. The latter should also have permanent monitoring powers, particularly as regards recognition of interbranch organisations operating at regional or inter-regional level and the agreements and concerted practices adopted by such organisations.\n(9) For the information of the Member States and other interested parties there should be provision for publication, at least once a year , of a list of the organisations recognised during the previous year, a list of the organisations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules which have been extended with an indication of their scope.\n(10) In order to be sufficiently representative for its region, an interbranch organisation must cover at least one-third of the quantities produced, processed or purchased by the members of each of the branches. Likewise, in order to avoid imbalances between regions it must meet this requirement in all of the regions in which it operates.\n(11) It should be specified that trade in tobacco covers, in addition to the business of tobacco merchants, direct purchase of baled tobacco by its final users.\n(12) Where the Commission is responsible for the recognition of an interbranch organisation, the information which the interbranch organisation must provide to the Commission should be specified.\n(13) Withdrawal of recognition must in general be made effective from the time the requirements for recognition ceased to be met.\n(14) It should be specified that the minimum degree of representation of interbranch organisations operating inter-regionally must be the same as that laid down for regional interbranch organisations.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation lays down the conditions for the recognition and activity of interbranch organisations operating in the sector covered by the market organisation for tobacco products as referred to in Part\u00a0XIV of Annex\u00a0I of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007.", "Recognition\nRecognition of interbranch organisations shall provide authorisation for them to carry out the activities referred to in point\u00a0(c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a0123 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007, subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.", "Recognition by the Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On application, a Member State shall recognise interbranch organisations established in their territory which:\n(a) carry out their activities at regional or inter-regional level within its territory;\n(b) pursue the aims referred to in point\u00a0(c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a0123 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007 by engaging in activities to:\n(i) contribute to enhanced coordination of the placing on the market of leaf or baled tobacco;\n(ii) prepare standard contracts compatible with Community rules;\n(iii) improve market intelligence and transparency;\n(iv) increase value added, particularly by means of marketing and research into new uses which do not pose a threat to public health;\n(v) redirect the sector towards products which better meet market and public health requirements;\n(vi) carry out research of methods permitting reduced use of plant health products and guaranteeing product quality and soil conservation;\n(vii) develop methods and instruments for improving product quality at the production and processing stages;\n(viii) use certified seed and monitor product quality;\n(c) do not themselves undertake the production, processing or marketing of the products referred to in Article\u00a01;\n(d) cover a significant proportion of the production and/or trade in relation to the sphere of action and the branches represented.
