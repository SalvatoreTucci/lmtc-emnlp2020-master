Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. For that purpose, new Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.\n(2) The quota amount for an autonomous Community tariff quota is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period and should therefore be increased.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The tariff quotas listed in the Annex to this Regulation shall be added to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.", "For the quota period from 1 January to 31 December 2006, in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 the amount of the tariff quota for the order number 09.2986 shall be fixed at 14\u00a0315 tonnes.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 27 June 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
