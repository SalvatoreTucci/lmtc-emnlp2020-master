This prevents them from accepting delivery of new wine for distillation before the date laid down in the Regulation.\n(3) To rectify this situation, the date by which wine must be delivered for distillation and the date by which alcohol must be delivered to public storage should be postponed for one month.\n(4) Since the deadline for delivery for distillation fell on 30 November 2002, this Regulation should apply from 1 December 2002.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1367/2002, is hereby replaced by the following:\n\"3.
