One of those establishments is allowed to receive and process compliant and non-compliant raw milk without separation. It should therefore be included in the list of Chapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI. One milk processing establishment currently listed in Chapter I will process only compliant raw milk and will therefore be considered as an EU-approved milk processing establishment. That establishment should therefore be deleted from the list of Chapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI.\n(3) The Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55.\nANNEX\nChapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended as follows:\n1. the following entry is added:\nNo Veterinary No Name of the establishment Town/Street or Village/Region\n\u201847 2812010 ET \u201cMladost-2-Yanko Yanev\u201d gr.Yambol, ul.\u201cYambolen\u201d 13\u2019\n2. the following entry is deleted:\nNo Veterinary No Name of the establishment Town/Street or Village/Region\ngr.Sliven\nkv.Industrialen\u2019"}
