However, one Member State subsequently informed the Commission that a large number of applications submitted by its operators were inadmissible. As a result, against all expectations, considerable quantities remain available for the period concerned. Those quantities should therefore be laid down and a derogation made from the first sentence of Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 by authorising, exceptionally, the lodging of new licence applications for these quantities in accordance with the rules laid down by Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the first sentence of Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, import licence applications may be lodged from Monday, 6 February 2006 for the quantities of 464\u00a0879,874 tonnes available under subquota III referred to in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2006.\nThe applications shall be lodged under the terms laid down by Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002, and in particular Article 5 thereof.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 February 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 January 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.
