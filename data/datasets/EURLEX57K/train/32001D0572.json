A Community financial contribution is also required for monitoring and certain control measures including vaccination against Bluetongue in high risk areas or in areas where the disease is endemic.\n(10) In the light of these developments, ISA and Bluetongue should be added to the list in question so that a Community financial contribution can be obtained for the implementation of programmes for the eradication and monitoring of these diseases. In the case of Bluetongue, specific criteria should be adopted to enable the financial measure provided for in Article 24(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC to be implemented.\n(11) In order to be eligible for a Community financial contribution, the relevant requirements of Decision 90/424/EEC and, with regard to ISA, Council Directive 93/53/EEC of 24 June 1993 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases [2] must be respected.\n(12) Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector [3] and in particular Article 15(3)(g) thereof, is the appropriate legal basis for ensuring a financial assistance with regard to ISA; therefore the provisions of Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds [4] are applicable by derogation to those provided for under Article 24, paragraphs 5, 6, second sentence, 8 and 9 of Decision 90/424/EEC.\n(13) Decision 90/424/EEC should accordingly be amended,", "main_body": ["In the Annex to Decision 90/424/EEC the following indents shall be added to group 1:\n\"\u2014 Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) [5]\n\u2014 Bluetongue in endemic or high risk areas [6].\"\n.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 July 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
