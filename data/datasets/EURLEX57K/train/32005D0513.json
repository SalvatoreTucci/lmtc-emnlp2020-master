Article 3.2 of this Directive obliges manufacturers to ensure that equipment does not cause harmful interference to other users of the spectrum.\n(8) In several Member States, there is an essential need for the operation of military and meteorological radars in the bands between 5\u00a0250\u00a0and 5\u00a0850\u00a0MHz which requires specific protection against harmful interference by WAS/RLAN.\n(9) There also is a need to specify appropriate equivalent isotropic radiated power limits and operational restrictions, such as indoor use restrictions, for WAS/RLANs in particular in the frequency band 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350 MHz in order to protect systems in the Earth exploration-satellite service (active), space research service (active) and mobile-satellite service feeder links.\n(10) As specified in the CEPT report sharing between the radars in the radiodetermination service and WAS/RLANs in the frequency bands 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350\u00a0MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725\u00a0MHz is only feasible with the application of power limits and mitigation techniques that ensure that WAS/RLANs do not interfere with radar applications/systems. Transmitter Power Control (TPC) and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) have therefore been included in the harmonised standard EN 301\u00a0893\u00a0(7) developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to provide presumption of conformity for WAS/RLAN equipment with Directive 1999/5/EC. Transmitter power control (TPC) in WAS/RLANs in the bands 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350\u00a0MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725\u00a0MHz would facilitate sharing with satellite services by significantly reducing the aggregate interference. DFS, which complies with the detection, operational and response requirements set out in Annex I to Recommendation ITU-RM. 1652\u00a0(8) avoids that WAS/RLANs use frequencies that are in use by radars. The effectiveness of the mitigation techniques in EN 301\u00a0893 to protect fixed frequency radars will be monitored. It is subject to review so as to take account of new developments, based on the study by Member States of suitable test methods and procedures for mitigation techniques.\n(11) It is recognised at Community and ITU level that there is a need for further studies and the possibility of development of alternative technical/operational conditions for WAS/RLANs, whilst still providing appropriate protection of other primary services in particular radiolocation. Furthermore, it is appropriate for national administrations to perform measurement campaigns and testing to facilitate coexistence between various services. Such studies and development will be taken into account in the future review of this Decision.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Decision is to harmonise the conditions for the availability and efficient use of the frequency bands 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350\u00a0MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725\u00a0MHz for wireless access systems including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs).", "For the purposes of this Decision the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018wireless access systems including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs)\u2019 shall mean broadband radio systems that allow wireless access for public and private applications disregarding the underlying network topology.\n(b) \u2018indoor use\u2019 shall mean use inside a building, including places assimilated thereto such as an aircraft, in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to facilitate sharing with other services.\n(c) \u2018mean equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.)\u2019 shall mean e.i.r.p. during the transmission burst which corresponds to the highest power, if power control is implemented.", "Member States shall designate by 31 October 2005 at the latest the frequency bands 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350\u00a0MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725\u00a0MHz and take all appropriate means relating thereto for the implementation of WAS/RLANs, subject to the specific conditions laid down in Article 4.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the frequency band 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0350 MHz, WAS/RLANs shall be restricted to indoor use with a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200\u00a0mW.\nFurthermore, the maximum mean e.i.r.p. density shall be limited:\n(a) to 0,25\u00a0mW/25 kHz in any 25 kHz band, in the band 5\u00a0150-5\u00a0250 MHz and\n(b) to 10\u00a0mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band, in the band 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350 MHz.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the frequency band 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725 MHz, the indoor and outdoor use of WAS/RLANs shall be restricted to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 1 W and a maximum mean e.i.r.p. density of 50\u00a0mW/MHz in any 1\u00a0MHz band.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WAS/RLANs operating in the bands 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350 MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725 MHz shall employ transmitter power control, which provides, on average, a mitigation factor of at least 3 dB on the maximum permitted output power of the systems.\nIf transmitter power control is not in use, the maximum permitted mean e.i.r.p. and the corresponding mean e.i.r.p. density limits for the 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350 MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725 MHz bands shall be reduced by 3 dB.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WAS/RLANs operating in the bands 5\u00a0250-5\u00a0350 MHz and 5\u00a0470-5\u00a0725 MHz shall use mitigation techniques that give at least the same protection as the detection, operational and response requirements described in EN 301\u00a0893 to ensure compatible operation with radiodetermination systems.
