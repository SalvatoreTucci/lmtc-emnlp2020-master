They should therefore be included in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(2) Azo-dyes CI 12150, CI 20170 and CI 27290 are included in Part 1 of Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC as colouring agents which are allowed for use in cosmetic products. The safety of those colorants has been questioned on the ground that they may form carcinogenic amines during metabolism. The SCCNFP is of the opinion, based on the available information, that the use of the colorants CI 12150, CI 20170 and CI 27290 poses a risk to the health of the consumer as they may release one or more carcinogenic aromatic amines. Those colorants should therefore be excluded from Part 1 of Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(3) Benzethonium chloride is included as reference number 53 in Part 1 of Annex VI to Directive 76/768/EEC as a preservative which may be employed in rinse-off cosmetic products up to a concentration of 0,1\u00a0%. It is the opinion of the SCCNFP that Benzethonium chloride should also be allowed to be employed in leave-on cosmetic products other than for oral care use up to a concentration of 0,1\u00a0%. The entry under the reference number 53 in Part 1 of Annex VI to Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The SCCNFP is of the opinion that Methylisothiazolinone does not pose a risk to the health of consumers if employed in finished cosmetic products as a preservative up to a concentration of 0,01\u00a0%. Methylisothiazolinone should therefore be included in Part 1 of Annex VI to Directive 76/768/EEC as reference number 57.\n(5) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annexes II, IV and VI to Directive 76/768/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that from 31 March 2006 cosmetic products which fail to comply with Annexes II and IV of Directive 76/768/EEC as amended by this Directive are not placed on the market by Community manufacturers or by importers established within the Community, nor sold or disposed of to the final consumer.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2005 at the latest.
