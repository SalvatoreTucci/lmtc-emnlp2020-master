Whereas, on this basis of assessment, the total amount of aid proposed is 177 600 000 European units of account, i.e. 23 768 European units of account per tonne ; whereas this figure is exceptionally high compared with that for the other Member States of the Community;\nWhereas the following observations can be made on the compatibility of the proposed current production aids with the proper functioning of the common market:    - owing to the large stockpiles, there were no supply difficulties in 1976;\n- there was no adverse effect on trade in coal between Belgium and the other Member States in 1976;\n- the closure of two unprofitable pits will result in rationalization and the concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest;\n- the prices of Belgian boiler coal in 1976 did not result in indirect aid to industrial consumers of coal;\n- in the first half of 1976 the prices of Belgian coking coal matched the prices of US coking coal under long-term contracts;\nWhereas there was a development in July 1976 which did not reflect the price trend for US coking coal imported under long-term contracts ; whereas the rebates on the prices of Belgian coking coal granted to the Belgian steel industry were raised in the summer of 1976, although there had been little change in the prices of US coking coal imported under long-term contracts;\nWhereas, as a result of the increase in the price rebates in the summer, in the second half of the year the Belgian steel industry paid prices lower than the guide cif price of Bfrs 2335 per tonne set by the Commission;\nWhereas, an application having been made for the Campine coalfield (coking coal supplier) for 1976 for investment aid totalling Bfrs 230 000 000, stockpiling aid totalling Bfrs 467 500 000 and loss-covering aid totalling Bfrs 2 250 200 000 pursuant to Decision No 528/76/ECSC and for coking coal aid totalling Bfrs 1 606 000 000 pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC, the aids applied for pursuant to Decision No 528/76/ECSC can be approved, this in no way prejudging the examination now in progress under Decision 73/287/ECSC of pricing problems concerning coking coal;\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of Decision No 528/76/ECSC, the Commission has to ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof ; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amount of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the calendar year 1976 to grant the following aids to the Belgian coal-mining industry:    (a) for the financing of investment projects:\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 230 000 000, Sud coalfield, up to Bfrs 11 300 000;\n(b) for the covering of costs of stocks of coal and coke:\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 467 500 000;\n(c) for the covering of pit operating losses:\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 2 250 200 000, Sud coalfield, up to Bfrs 2 729 200 000.", "The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium shall notify the Commission by 30 November 1977 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amount of the payments made and the manner in which they are apportioned.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 September 1977.\nFor the Commission\nGuido BRUNNER\nMember of the Commission"}
