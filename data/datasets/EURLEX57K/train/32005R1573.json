Promoting the use of biofuels may open up a new market for the agricultural products of the Member States.\n(3) Germany has significant intervention stocks of rye for which it is proving difficult to find markets and which should therefore be disposed of. To this end, sales on the Community market may be organised by tendering procedure with a view to processing the rye into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community, within the meaning of Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport\u00a0(3).\n(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(5) It is also important for the German intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission to maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(6) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(7) To enable checks on the particular destination of the stocks covered by tendering procedures, provision should be made for specific monitoring of, on the one hand, the delivery of the rye and its processing into bioethanol and, on the other hand, its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community. To permit this monitoring, application of the procedures laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention\u00a0(4) and Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products\u00a0(5) respectively should be made compulsory.\n(8) To guarantee proper performance, tenderers should be asked to lodge a security which, in view of the nature of the operations concerned, should be fixed by derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, in particular as regards the conditions for its release.\n(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The German intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 200\u00a0000 tonnes of rye held by it, for processing into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a) of Directive 2003/30/EC.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding:\n(a) Article 13(1) of that Regulation, tenders shall be drawn up by reference to the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the second paragraph of Article 10 of that Regulation, the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.", "Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by:\n(a) proof that the tenderer has lodged a security which, notwithstanding the second subparagraph of Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, is set at EUR 10 per tonne;\n(b) the tenderer\u2019s written undertaking to use the rye for processing within the Community into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community before 30 August 2006 and to lodge a security of EUR 40 within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received;\n(c) an undertaking to keep stock records so that checks may be carried out to ensure that the quantities of rye awarded have been processed on Community territory into bioethanol and that this ethanol has been used for the production of biofuel in the Community.\nThe holding and movement of ethanol is subject to Directive 92/12/EEC for the purposes of the production of biofuels.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 5 October 2005.\nThe closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Wednesday at 15.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 2 November 2005, 28 December 2005, 12 April 2006, 24 May 2006 and 14 June 2006, i.e. weeks when no invitation to tender shall be made.\nThe last partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 28 June 2006.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders must be lodged with the German intervention agency at the following address:\nBundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und Ern\u00e4hrung (BLE)\nDeichmannsaue 29\nD-53179 Bonn\nFax: (49-228) 6845\u00a03985\n(49-228) 6845\u00a03276.", "Within two hours of the expiry of the time-limit for the submission of tenders, the German intervention agency shall notify the Commission of tenders received.
