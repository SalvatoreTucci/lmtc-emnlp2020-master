Ornaments      6.1.1. Added ornaments which project more than 10 mm from their support shall retract, become detached or bend over under a force of 10 daN exerted at their most salient point in any direction in a plane approximately parallel to the surface on which they are mounted. These provisions shall not apply to ornaments on radiator grilles, to which only the general requirements of item 5 shall apply.\n6.1.2. Protective strips or shielding on the external surface shall not be subject to the requirements of item 6.1.1 above. However, they shall be firmly secured to the vehicle.\n6.1.3. If the added ornaments are less than 5 mm thick, the requirement of a 2 75 mm minimum radius of curvature shall not apply, but the outward facing angles of such ornaments shall be blunted.\n6.2. Headlights      6.2.1. Projecting visors and rims shall be permitted on headlights, provided that their projection, as measured in relation to the external transparent surface of the headlight does not exceed 30 mm and their radius of curvature is at least 2.5 mm throughout.\n6.2.2. Retracting headlights shall meet the requirements of item 6.2.1 above in both the operative and retracted positions.\n6.3. Grilles and gaps      6.3.1. The requirements of item 5.4 shall not apply to gaps between fixed or movable elements including those forming part of air intake or outlet grilles and radiator grilles, provided that the distance between consecutive elements does not exceed 40 mm.

CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION  (8.1.)\n8.2. In order to verify conformity with the approved type, a sufficient number of random checks shall be performed on serially produced vehicles.\n(9.)   (9.1.)\n(9.2.)\n(10.)\nANNEX II METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE HEIGHT OF EXTERNAL SURFACE PROJECTIONS\n1. The height H of a projection is determined graphically by reference to the circumference of a 165 mm diameter circle, internally tangential to the external outline of the external surface at the section to be checked.\n2. H is the maximum value of the distance, measured along a straight line passing through the centre of the 165 mm diameter circle, between the circumference of the aforesaid circle and the external contour of the projection (see Fig. 1).\n3. In cases where it is not possible for a 100 mm diameter circle to contact externally part of the external outline of the external surface at the section under consideration, the surface outline in this area will be assumed to be that formed by the circumference of the 100 mm diameter circle between its tangent points with the external outline (see Fig. 2).\n4. Drawings of the necessary sections through the external surface shall be provided by the manufacturer to allow the height of the projections referred to above to be measured.\n>PIC FILE= \"T0006119\">\nANNEX III MODEL\n>PIC FILE= \"T0006120\">"}
