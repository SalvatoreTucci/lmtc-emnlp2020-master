These price levels and ceilings eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.\n(5) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the undertaking, CCCME and the Companies also agreed to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission and to allow on-spot verification visits at their premises in order to permit verifications of the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports.\n(6) As noted in recital 239 of Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002, the undertaking specifically provides that a breach by any of the Companies or the CCCME shall be considered as a breach of the undertaking by all signatories. Failure to cooperate with the European Commission in monitoring the undertaking is considered as a breach of the undertaking.\n(7) In this regard, the Commission requested to carry out on-spot verification visits at the premises of CCCME and of the two companies with the largest reported volume of sales of the product concerned, namely Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co., Ltd and Konka Group Co., Ltd. The Commission sent pre-verification letters to CCCME, Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co., Ltd and Konka Group Co., Ltd with an indication of the dates for the on-spot verification.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the verification request\n(8) The CCCME and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co., Ltd confirmed the acceptance of the verification visit requested by the Commission.

This included the possibility of these officials performing on-spot investigations at the premises of the Companies and/or the CCCME, even at short notice.\n(10) By letter, the company Konka Group Co., Ltd, confirmed that they had no interest to cooperate and this position taken by the company was furthermore confirmed by the CCCME.\n(11) Accordingly, the CCCME and the Companies were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to withdraw the Commission\u2019s acceptance of the undertaking, due to the breach of the undertaking by Konka Group Co., Ltd, and to impose the definitive anti-dumping duty in its place. A period was granted within which representations could be made both in writing and orally. No comments were received.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF DECISION 2002/683/EC\n(12) In the light of the above, it is considered that acceptance of the undertaking offered by the Companies in conjunction with the CCCME, should be withdrawn.
