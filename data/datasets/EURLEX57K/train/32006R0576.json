These producer organisations have thus taken full account of environmental and quality concerns in their operational programmes. It is therefore envisaged to eliminate the current limit of ten years per action for these measures.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["In point 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003, the introductory words of the first subparagraph are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.
