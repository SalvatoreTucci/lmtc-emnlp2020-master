Experience has shown that adjustments are needed in order to simplify the arrangements and harmonise them with current practice for other products such as cereals and milk powder.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 guarantees prices and disposal only for sugar produced under quota. Access to intervention should therefore be restricted to manufacturers who are holders of a quota and who, in return for the price guarantee, are required to pay the minimum price for beet, while respecting the legitimate expectations of specialist traders who have already been granted the necessary approval to offer sugar for intervention.\n(3) Recent experience in sugar intervention operations has shown that the criteria for the intervention storage of sugar and the approval of warehouses and silos should be made more stringent, in particular by giving the intervention agencies greater discretionary powers. It is also accepted that sugar can be stored for a very long time without risk of deterioration in quality where the storage conditions are right. Therefore the rules on the final dates for removal should be amended, whilst, to take account of legitimate expectations, the rules on sugar offered for intervention before a certain date should be maintained.\n(4) Intervention procedures for sugar must be brought into line with those followed in other sectors such as cereals and milk powder, in particular as regards time limits for payment from the submission of tenders for intervention.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1498/2005, lays down the requirements to be met by certain forms of packaging in which sugar bought in must be delivered. Certain clarifications are needed to ensure that this provision is properly applied.\n(6) In order to facilitate the day-to-day management of intervention, in particular by creating uniform lots, the minimum quantity below which the intervention agency is not obliged to accept a tender should be increased.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
