It appears that applications for export licences for butter with a fat content of 80\u00a0% are negligible. For the sake of simplification it is appropriate to abolish the procedure for such products.\n(2) By way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3), Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 provides that export licences obtained under the tender procedure are not transferable.
