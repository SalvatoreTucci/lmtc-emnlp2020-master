In order to improve traceability and to monitor and improve the designation, holdings must complete a declaration of suitability to produce the designation. With regard to the method of production, it appears that the heifers of the breed chosen for the denomination, when reared in accordance with the specification for the denomination, do not reach the weight of 100 kg, although the carcasses comply with the specification and are awarded the denomination on this basis. It appeared necessary to acknowledge that the weight of the carcasses of heifers aged between 18 and 30 months was at least 85 kg.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified. Since the amendment in question is minor within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission may approve the application without following the procedure laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of that Regulation.\n(4) In accordance with Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006\u00a0(3) and pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, a summary of the specification should be published,", "main_body": ["The specification for the protected designation of origin \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 is hereby amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "A summary of the main points of the specification is given in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 October 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a093, 31.3.2006, p.\u00a012.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0275, 18.10.2001, p.\u00a09.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0369, 23.12.2006, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX I\nThe specification for the protected designation of origin \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 is amended as follows:\nProof of origin\nMethod of production\nANNEX II\nSUMMARY\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006\n\u2018TAUREAU DE CAMARGUE\u2019\nEC No: FR-PDO-105-0041/30.3.2006\nPDO (X)\u00a0PGI (\u00a0)\nThis summary sets out the main elements of the product specification for information purposes.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsible department in the Member State\nName : Institut National des Appellations d\u2019Origine\nAddress : 51, rue d\u2019Anjou, F-75008 PARIS\nTel. : (33) 1 53 89 80 00\nFax : (33) 1 42 25 57 97\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Group\nName : Syndicat de d\u00e9fense et de Promotion de la viande AOC Taureau de Camargue\nAddress : Mas du Pont de Rousty, F-13200 ARLES\nTel. : (33) 4 90 97 10 40\nFax : (33) 4 90 97 12 07\ne-mail : \u2014\nComposition : Producers/processors (X)\u00a0Other (\u00a0)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product\nClass 1.1 \u2014 Fresh meat (and offal)\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specification (summary of requirements under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description\nFresh meat of male or female animals, of local breeds, born, reared, slaughtered and cut in the geographical area. Meat from \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 is a distinctive deep red colour. It is tender and lean.\n4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geographical area\nThe Camargue stretches over three departments: Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Gard and H\u00e9rault. Within this area, a wetland area has been marked out in which the bulls must remain for at least six months.\n4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of origin\nThe earliest documentary reference to the \u2018Taureau de Camargue\u2019 is attributable to Quiqueran de Beaujeu, Bishop of Sen\u00e8s, and dates from 1551. Since then reference has been made in numerous works to the original nature of these animals and their method of rearing carried on principally to produce bulls for sport. The holdings (herds or livestock farms) where the animals whose meat is intended for production for the designation must be born or reared, must complete a declaration of suitability to produce the denomination. Each animal is identified separately and entered in a stock book or register. Slaughterhouses and cutting plants are required to keep records of arrivals and departures so that animals can be traced up to the time they reach the consumer.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nAnimals of local breeds (\u2018ra\u00e7o di biou\u2019, \u2018de combat\u2019 or a cross of the two) must be born, reared, slaughtered and cut in the geographical area. They must be reared unrestrained, in the open air and extensively to ensure that they remain wild. Their main feed must consist of pasture. They must remain in the wetland area for not less than six months. Slaughter must take place as soon as the animals are unloaded. The weight of carcasses for tax purposes must be 100 kg or more, except for heifers of between 18 and 30 months, for which the weight is set at 85 kg. The carcasses must be deep red in colour. They are drained slightly. Carcasses should be hung in the slaughterhouse for not less than 48 hours and not more than five days.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\n\u2018Taureaux de Camargue\u2019 are produced from traditional local breeds which are particularly well adapted to the low-lying Camargue environment with its ever-present water. Reared unrestrained, they feed on pasture and remain for at least six months in this wetland area with its special ecosystem. The excitable and aggressive nature of these breeds means that they are perfectly suited to the purpose for which they are intended and gives the beef its characteristic features.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName : Institut National des Appellations d\u2019Origine\nAddress : 51, rue d\u2019Anjou, F-75008 PARIS\nTel. : (33) 1 53 89 80 00\nFax : (33) 1 42 25 57 97\ne-mail : info@inao.gouv.fr\nName : DGCCRF\nAddress : 59, Bd V.
