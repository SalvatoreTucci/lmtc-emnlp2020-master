This is an ideal opportunity to underline the educational value of sport.\n(14) Action in Member States is the main way in which public awareness of the educational value of sport can be raised. However, the Community can support and reinforce such action through the establishment of a European Year of Education through Sport.\n(15) A European Year of Education through Sport will complement and reinforce existing Community action to promote education and training, as well as the social inclusion of disadvantaged persons.\n(16) The European Year of Education through Sport should be opened up for participation by the EFTA/EEA countries in accordance with the conditions established under the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA), and by the associated central and eastern European countries in line with the conditions laid down pursuant to their respective Europe Agreements. For Cyprus, this participation should be funded by additional appropriations in accordance with arrangements to be agreed upon, and for Malta and Turkey by additional appropriations in accordance with the EC Treaty.\n(17) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(8).\n(18) Since the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of their scale, especially for the need for multilateral partnerships, transnational exchange of information and Community-wide dissemination of good practices, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(19) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9),", "main_body": ["The European Year of Education through Sport\nThe year 2004 shall be designated \"European Year of Education through Sport\".", "Aims\nThe aims of the European Year of Education through Sport shall be as follows:\n(a) to make educational institutions and sports organisations aware of the need for cooperation in order to develop education through sport and its European dimension, given the very great interest that young people take in all kinds of sport;\n(b) to take advantage of the values conveyed through sport to develop knowledge and skills whereby young people in particular can develop their physical prowess and readiness for personal effort and also social abilities such as teamwork, solidarity, tolerance and fair play in a multicultural framework;\n(c) to promote awareness of the positive contribution that voluntary activities make to non-formal education, especially of young people;\n(d) to promote the educational value of pupil mobility and exchanges particularly in a multicultural environment through the organisation of sporting and cultural contacts as part of school activity;\n(e) to encourage the exchange of good practice concerning the role sport can play in education systems to promote the social inclusion of disadvantaged groups;\n(f) to create a better balance between intellectual and physical activity in school life by encouraging sport in school activities;\n(g) to consider the problems relating to the education of young sportsmen and sportswomen taking part in competitive sports.", "Content of the measures\n1.
