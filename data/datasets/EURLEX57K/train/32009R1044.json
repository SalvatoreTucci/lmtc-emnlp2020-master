However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 274/2009\u00a0(3) has fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar at 650\u00a0000 tonnes in respect of marketing year 2009/2010. However, according to the most recent forecasts issued at the beginning of the 2009/2010 sugar beet harvest it is certain that due to exceptionally favourable weather conditions a very important amount of out-of-quota beet sugar would be produced in the Community. The amount of out-of-quota sugar to be produced in 2009/2010 is initially estimated at around 3-4 million tonnes, which would lead to serious storage problems and provoking large quantity of sugar to be carried forward as quota sugar for marketing year 2010/2011. It is therefore necessary to increase the quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar exports to 1\u00a0350\u00a0000\u00a0t in respect of marketing year 2009/2010.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 274/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["In Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 274/2009, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2009/2010 marketing year, running from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010, the quantitative limit referred to in Article 61, first subparagraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be 1\u00a0350\u00a0000 tonnes for exports without refund of out-of-quota white sugar falling within CN code 1701\u00a099.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0178, 1.7.2006, p.\u00a024.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a091, 3.4.2009, p.\u00a016."}
