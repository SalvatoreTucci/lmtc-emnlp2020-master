The Authority concluded that, based on the results of the available studies, the information on gum acacia itself and on other Octenyl succinic acid modified starches, the use of octenyl succinic acid modified gum arabic as an emulsifier in foods at the proposed uses and use levels is not of a safety concern.\n(7) There is a technological need to use Octenyl succinic acid modified gum arabic as an emulsifier in certain foodstuffs as well as an emulsifier in flavouring-oil emulsions which are added to a variety of foodstuffs as it has improved properties compared to existing emulsifiers. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of octenyl succinic acid modified gum arabic in the food categories applied for and to assign number E 423 to that food additive.\n(8) The specifications for Octenyl succinic acid modified gum arabic should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union lists of food additives laid down in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 83, 22.3.2012, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(3):1539.\nANNEX I\nA.
