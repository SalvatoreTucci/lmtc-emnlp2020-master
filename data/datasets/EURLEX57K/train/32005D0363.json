African swine fever must still be considered an endemic disease in the domestic and feral pig population of the province of Nuoro. Some outbreaks of that disease in domestic pigs have, however, also been notified in other provinces of Sardinia.\n(3) The disease situation is liable to endanger the pig herds in other regions of Italy and in other Member States, in view of trade in live pigs, pig semen, ova and embryos and pig meat, pig meat products and other products containing pig meat.\n(4) Italy has taken measures to combat African swine fever in Sardinia within the framework of Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever\u00a0(5).\n(5) Italy has reviewed the measures taken so far to combat the disease in the light of the recrudescence of the disease in 2004.\n(6) Commission Decision 2005/362/EC of 2 May 2005 approving the plan for the eradication of African swine fever in feral pigs in Sardina, Italy\u00a0(6) was adopted in order to approve the plan for the eradication of African swine fever in feral pigs submitted by Italy.\n(7) In the light of the current epidemiological situation, it is appropriate to apply further Community measures to the whole territory of Sardinia as regards the movement of live pigs and pig semen, ova and embryos and the dispatch of pig meat, pig meat products and products containing pig meat.\n(8) It is appropriate to provide for certain derogations from the measures provided for in this Decision for pig meat originating from pigs which have entered Sardinia as pigs for slaughter in accordance with Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine\u00a0(7) or Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries\u00a0(8) or Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC\u00a0(9) or that satisfies certain requirements of this Decision.\n(9) It is also appropriate to provide for certain derogations for pig meat products and other products containing pig meat obtained from meat that entered Sardinia as fresh pig meat in accordance with Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat\u00a0(10) or in accordance with Directive 2002/99/EC or that comply with Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting the production and marketing of meat products and certain other products of animal origin\u00a0(11) or that satisfy certain requirements of this Decision.\n(10) In order to ensure that pig meat, pig meat products and other products containing pig meat, not fulfilling certain animal health requirements are not dispatched from Sardinia and to ensure the traceability of such pig meat and products, the pig meat should be specially marked. These special marks must be such that they cannot be confused with the oval stamp for pig meat provided for in point 50 of Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC, or after its date of application the health mark in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(12), and with the oval stamp for pig meat products and other products containing pig meat provided for in point 4 of Chapter VI of Annex B to Directive 77/99/EEC, or after its date of application the identification mark in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin\u00a0(13).\n(11) Decision 2003/514/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Decision lays down animal health rules on:\n(a) the movement of live pigs, pig semen, ova and embryos and the dispatch of pig meat, pig meat products and any other products containing pig meat originating from Sardinia;
