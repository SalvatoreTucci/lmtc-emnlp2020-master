Therefore, the share registration schedule should be applicable to those underlying shares and should be added to the combinations used for drawing up the prospectus.\n(4) Where securities with warrants or derivative securities give the right to acquire the issuer\u2019s or group\u2019s shares and those shares are not admitted to trading on a regulated market, the relevant information set out in the securities note schedule for derivative securities should be provided to investors.\n(5) Where debt securities are exchangeable or convertible into shares already admitted to trading on a regulated market, information on the underlying shares is already available to shareholders and investors in general. Therefore, it should be clarified that it is sufficient to add a statement setting out the type of the underlying and details of where information on the underlying can be obtained in the combinations used for drawing up the securities note of the prospectus.\n(6) Where debt securities are convertible or exchangeable into shares which are or will be issued by the issuer of the security or by an entity belonging to its group and these underlying shares are not already admitted to trading on a regulated market, investors should also be provided with a working capital statement and a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares. Those statements would provide investors in the securities note with the same information on the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue as a going concern and on its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as would be available when investing in shares directly.\n(7) Where the underlying shares are issued by a third party and are not admitted to trading on a regulated market the investors do not have easy access to a description of those underlying shares. Therefore, the additional building block describing the underlying share should be added to the combinations used for drawing up the securities note of the prospectus.\n(8) For reasons of legal certainty it is necessary to clarify, in the table set out in Annex XVIII to Regulation (EC) No 809/2004, how schedules and building blocks should be combined when drawing up a prospectus, including where only certain information items of schedules and building blocks are required, where certain information items may not be applicable due to specific combinations of schedules and building blocks in particular cases, and where the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market may choose between different schedules and building blocks according to specific thresholds, such as the minimum denomination of debt securities, or conditions set out in Regulation (EC) No 809/2004.\n(9) The term \u2018bonds\u2019 should be replaced by the term \u2018debt securities\u2019 in order to ensure consistency of terminology within Regulation (EC) No 809/2004.\n(10) The application of the pro forma financial information building block set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 is conditional upon a significant gross change in the size of the issuer, therefore the words \u2018(if applicable)\u2019 should be added to the heading of the column entitled \u2018BUILDING BLOCK\u2019 applicable to the registration document in Annex XVIII to that Regulation to reflect the conditional applicability of Annex II to that Regulation.\n(11) Convertible or exchangeable debt securities can provide access to issuer\u2019s new shares when the right to subscribe is exercised by their holders. Accordingly, rights issues of convertible or exchangeable debt securities into issuer\u2019s new shares should also be able to benefit from the proportionate disclosure regime set out in Article 26a of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 provided that the underlying shares are new shares issued by the same entity issuing debt securities. The prospectus for the offer or admission to trading on a regulated market of debt securities convertible or exchangeable into issuer\u2019s shares issued by small and medium sized enterprises and companies with reduced market capitalisation should also benefit from the proportionate disclosure regime set out in Article 26b of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004. Accordingly, the combination of schedules and building blocks applicable to rights issues of debt securities convertible or exchangeable into issuer\u2019s shares or to convertible or exchangeable debt securities issued by small and medium sized enterprises and companies with reduced market capitalisation should be included in Annex XVIII.\n(12) In consideration of the need to provide issuers with a transitional period to adapt to the new requirements introduced by this Regulation, this Regulation should only apply to prospectuses and base prospectuses which have been approved by a competent authority on the date of or after its entry into force.\n(13) Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Regulation (EC) No
