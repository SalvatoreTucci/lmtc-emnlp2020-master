In the light of this concrete application of the control system and in the interest of organic livestock producers in the Union, it is appropriate to ensure the identification of certain production methods not using antibiotics when such identification is requested by the operator. Adequate information about the specific characteristics of the production method is also needed in order to facilitate the market access to the United States. Those specific characteristics should be attested through complementary documentary evidence provided in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, in addition to the documentary evidence referred to in Article 68 of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008.\n(4) Certain agricultural products imported from the United States are currently marketed in the Union pursuant to the transitional rules provided for in Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 of 8 December 2008 laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries\u00a0(3). The United States submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008. It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of that information and subsequent discussions with the US authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing the production and controls of organic agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Commission has carried out a satisfactory on-the-spot check of the rules of production and the control measures actually applied in the United States, as provided for in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Consequently, the United States should be included in the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.\n(5) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 contains a list of control bodies and control authorities competent to carry out controls and issue certificates in third countries for the purpose of equivalence. As a consequence of the inclusion of the United States in Annex III to that Regulation, the relevant US control bodies and control authorities should be deleted from Annex IV to the extent that they control production in the United States.\n(6) Regulations (EC) No 889/2008 and (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 63(1), the following point (d) is added:\n\u2018(d) the specific characteristics of the production method used, where the operator intends to request documentary evidence in accordance with Article 68(2).\u2019;\n(2) Article 68 is
