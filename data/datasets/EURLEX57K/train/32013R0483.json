In addition, the SCCP maintained that recent scientific evidence did not confirm the assumed local-anaesthetic effect of polidocanol. Thus, its presence in cosmetics and skin care products will not affect cutaneous sensation. It should therefore be included in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009.\n(2) The SCCS, in an Addendum of 13-14 December 2011 to the SCCP opinion on polidocanol, confirmed the conclusions of the SCCP.\n(3) Given that polidocanol was found in both injectable and topical medicinal products at concentrations even lower than the ones considered safe by the SCCP, the Commission requested the opinion of the European Medicines Agency on the classification of topical products containing the substance. The opinion, formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on 25 October 2011, concluded that products containing polidocanol do not automatically qualify as medicinal products falling under the definition of medicinal product provided in Article 1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use\u00a0(3). In addition, polidocanol used in topical products at the suggested concentrations and for the suggested topical use (3\u00a0% for leave-on products and 4\u00a0% for rinse-off products) acts as detergent or ionic surfactant and these products do not present the characteristics of medicinal products.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The application of the abovementioned restrictions should be deferred by 12\u00a0months to allow the industry to make the necessary adjustments to product formulations.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0342, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a059.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0241, 10.9.2008, p.\u00a021.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0311, 28.11.2001, p.\u00a067.\nANNEX\nThe following entry shall be inserted in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009:\nReference number Substance identification Restrictions Wording of conditions of use and warnings\nChemical name/INN Name of Common Ingredients Glossary CAS number EC number Product type, body parts Maximum concentration in ready for use preparation Other\na b c d e f g h i\n(a) Leave-on products\n(a) 3,0\u00a0%\n(b) Rinse-off products\n(b) 4,0\u00a0%\u2019"}
