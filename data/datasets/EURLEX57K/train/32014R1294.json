The fee for the technical examination should cover the cost for the technical examination of the variety and for each specific component of the variety. No maximum amount should therefore be fixed as regards the fee for the technical examination in such cases.\n(5) The experience gathered concerning the technical examination further shows that the total amount of the examination fees charged by the Office does not cover the total amount of the fees to be paid by the Office to the Examination Offices. The fees charged by the Office should, however, in principle cover the fees paid by it. The fees set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 should therefore be raised. At the same time the cost groups set out in that Annex should be simplified.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Community Plant Variety Rights,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 is amended as follows:\n(1) In Article 7, paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n(2) In Article 8, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 December 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0227, 1.9.1994, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 of 31 May 1995 establishing implementing rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 as regards the fees payable to the Community Plant Variety Office (OJ L\u00a0121, 1.6.1995, p.\u00a031).\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 1238/95 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFees relating to technical examination as referred to in Article 8\nThe fee to be paid for the technical examination of a variety pursuant to Article 8 shall be determined in accordance with the table:\n(in EUR)\nCost group Fee\nAgricultural group\n1 Potato 1\u00a0960\n2 Oilseed rape 1\u00a0860\n3 Grasses 2\u00a0210\n4 Other agricultural species 1\u00a0430\nFruit group\n5 Apple 3\u00a0210\n6 Strawberry 2\u00a0740\n7 Other fruit species 2\u00a0550\nOrnamental group\n8 Ornamental living greenhouse 2\u00a0140\n9 Ornamental living outdoor 1\u00a0960\n10 Ornamental non-living greenhouse 1\u00a0770\n11 Ornamental non-living outdoor 1\u00a0570\n12 Ornamental special 3\u00a0040\nVegetable group\n13 Vegetable greenhouse 2\u00a0150\n14 Vegetable outdoor 1\u00a0960\u2019"}
