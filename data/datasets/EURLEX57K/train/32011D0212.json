Spain received a contribution of EUR\u00a0289\u00a0144 for the replacement in 2009 of coniferous trees affected by the harmful organism Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Italy received a contribution of EUR\u00a014\u00a0525 for the replacement in 2008 of various tree species in Lombardia affected by the harmful organisms Anoplophora chinensis in the area of Gussago and Anoplophora glabripennis in the area of Corbetta.\n(5) This expenditure by Spain and Italy related directly to the prohibition of the future use of the particular trees which are host to the harmful organisms concerned, within the meaning of Article 23(2)(c) of Directive 2000/29/EC. This expenditure does not concern compensation for loss of earnings as referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph and the second subparagraph of Article 23(3) of that Directive.\n(6) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 23(5), of Directive 2000/29/EC, the financial contribution from the Union should therefore cover up to 50\u00a0% of the expenditure concerned, and should not be restricted to up to 25\u00a0% as was erroneously set out in Decision 2009/996/EU. Consequently, the maximum Union financial contribution to the relevant programmes submitted by Spain and Italy should be raised by EUR\u00a0289\u00a0145 and EUR\u00a014\u00a0525 respectively, and the total Union contribution for 2009 should be increased to EUR\u00a014\u00a0352\u00a0693.\n(7) Therefore Decision 2009/996/EU should be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2009/996/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 2(1) is replaced by the following:\n(2) in Section I of the Annex, the third, fourth and fifth row are replaced by the following:\n\u2018Spain Bursaphelenchus xylophilus Coniferous trees 2008 and 2009 1 and 2 3\u00a0386\u00a0573 1\u00a0693\u00a0286\nItaly, Lombardia Anoplophora chinensis Various tree species 2008 and part of 2009 (until 30 April) 1 and 2 302\u00a0683 151\u00a0341\nItaly, Lombardia Anoplophora glabripennis Various tree species 2007 and 2008 1 and 2 302\u00a0683 103\u00a0221\u2019\n(3) Section III of the Annex is deleted;\n(4) at the end of the Annex, the indication \u2018Total Community contribution (EUR): 14\u00a0049\u00a0023\u2019 is replaced by \u2018Total Union contribution (EUR): 14\u00a0352\u00a0693\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic and the Republic of Slovenia."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 April 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 339, 22.12.2009, p. 49."}
