However, the system excludes consumers who use gas:\n\u2014 for electricity generation in power plants or in CHP plants,\n\u2014 in non-energy uses (e.g. in the chemical industry),\n\u2014 above 4\u00a0000\u00a0000 gigajoule (GJ) per year.\n(c) Prices recorded to be based on a system of standard consumption bands defined by a range of annual gas consumption.\n(d) Prices will be collected twice per year, at the beginning of each six-month period, (January and July) and will refer to the average prices paid by industrial end-users for gas over the previous six months. The first communication of price data to the Statistical Office of the European Communities will refer to the situation on 1 January 2008.\n(e) Prices must be expressed in national currency per gigajoule. The unit of energy used is measured on the basis of the gross calorific value (GCV).\n(f) Prices must include all charges payable: network charges plus energy consumed minus any rebates or premiums, plus other charges (meter rental, standing charges, etc.). Initial connection charges are not to be included.\n(g) Prices are to be recorded as national average prices.\n(h) The Member States develop and implement cost-effective procedures to ensure a representative data compilation system based on the following rules:\n\u2014 Prices will represent weighted average prices, using the market shares of the gas supply undertakings surveyed as weighting factors. Arithmetic average prices will be provided only when weighted figures cannot be calculated. In either case, Member States will ensure that a representative share of the national market is covered by the survey.\n\u2014 Market shares should be based on the quantity of gas invoiced by the gas supply undertakings to industrial end-users. If possible, the market shares will be calculated separately for each band. The information used for calculating weighted average prices will be managed by Member States, respecting confidentiality rules.\n\u2014 In the interest of confidentiality, data relating to prices will be communicated only where there are, in the Member State concerned, at least three end-users in each of the categories referred to under point (j).\n(i) Three levels of prices are to be provided:\n\u2014 Prices excluding taxes and levies.\n\u2014 Prices excluding VAT and other recoverable taxes.\n\u2014 Prices including all taxes, levies and VAT.\n(j) Gas prices will be surveyed for the following categories of industrial end-user:\nIndustrial End-User Annual gas consumption (GJ)\nLowest Highest\nBand-I1  < 1\u00a0000\nBand-I2 1\u00a0000 < 10\u00a0000\nBand-I3 10\u00a0000 < 100\u00a0000\nBand-I4 100\u00a0000 < 1\u00a0000\u00a0000\nBand-I5 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 <= 4\u00a0000\u00a0000\n(k) Once every two years, together with the January price reporting, information about the compilation system applied will be communicated to the Statistical Office of the European Communities and particularly: a description of the survey and its scope (number of supply undertakings surveyed, aggregated percentage of the market represented, etc.) and the criteria used to calculate weighted average prices as well as the aggregated consumption volumes represented by each band. The first communication related to the compilation system shall concern the situation on 1 January 2008.\n(l) Once per year, together with the January price reporting, information about the main average characteristics and factors affecting the prices reported for each consumption band will be communicated to the Statistical Office of the European Communities.\n\u2014 Average load factors for industrial end-users corresponding to each consumption band calculated on the basis of the total energy supplied and average maximum demand.\n\u2014 A description on discounts given for interruptible supplies.\n\u2014 A description of standing charges, meter rentals or any other charges relevant at national level.\n(m) Once per year, together with the January reporting, the rates and method of calculation as well as a description of the taxes levied on gas sales to industrial end-users should also be reported.
