For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community should be deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.\n(7) Common Position 2004/487/CFSP also provides that certain exemptions from the freezing requirement can be granted for humanitarian purposes or the satisfaction of liens or judgments entered prior to the date of UNSCR 1532 (2004).\n(8) The UN Security Council has expressed its intention to consider whether and how to make available the funds and economic resources frozen pursuant to UNSCR 1532 (2004) to the Government of Liberia, once that Government has established transparent accounting and auditing mechanism to ensure the responsible use of government revenue to benefit directly the people of Liberia.\n(9) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018Sanctions Committee\u2019 means: the Committee of the Security Council of the United
