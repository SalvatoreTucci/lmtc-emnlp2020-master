SCHAVAN\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The World Customs Organisation was established by Convention establishing a Customs Cooperation Council (signed on 15 December 1950). The Convention came into force in 1952. In 1994 the Customs Cooperation Council adopted the working name \u2018World Customs Organisation\u2019, to more clearly reflect its scope. Presently the World Customs Organisation has 171 members.\nANNEX\nDeclaration of competence by the European Community in matters covered by the Convention establishing a Customs Cooperation Council\nIn accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended, this declaration sets out the competence that the Member States of the European Community have transferred to the European Community in matters governed by the Convention establishing a Customs Cooperation Council.\nThe European Community declares that it has, in accordance with Articles 131 to 134 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, exclusive competence on common commercial policy.\nThe European Community may conclude international agreements whenever the internal competence has already been used in order to adopt measures for implementing common policies or if international agreement is necessary to obtain one of the European Community\u2019s objectives. The European Community\u2019s external competence is exclusive to the extent to which an international agreement affects internal European Community rules or alters their scope. Where this is the case, it is not for the Member States of the European Community but for the European Community to enter into external undertakings with third States or International Organisations. A list of measures concerning customs matters adopted by the Community is provided for in the list of legal instruments in the Annex to this Declaration.\nThe exercise of competence which Member States of the European Community have transferred to the European Community pursuant to the Treaties is, by its nature, liable to continuous change. The European Community therefore reserves the right to adjust the declaration.\nAnnex\nEC LEGISLATION\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code\nCouncil Decision 2003/231/EC of 17 March 2003 concerning the accession of the European Community to the Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures (Kyoto Convention)\nDirective 2002/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 February 2002 on reporting formalities for ships arriving and/or departing from ports of the Member States of the Community\nCouncil Decision 80/271/EEC of 10 December 1979 concerning the conclusion of the Multilateral Agreements resulting from the 1973 to 1979 trade negotiations (OJ L 71, 17.3.1980, p. 1).\nSeveral joint committee decisions with third countries, e.g. 2006/343/EC: Decision No 2/2005 of the EC-Iceland Joint Committee of 22 December 2005 amending Protocol 3 to the Agreement, concerning the definition of the concept of originating products and methods of administrative cooperation\nCouncil Decision 87/369/EEC of 7 April 1987 concerning the conclusion of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and of the Protocol of Amendment thereto\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1549/2006 of 17 October 2006 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\nArticles 26 and 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 of 20 December 1996 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products and amending Regulation (EC) No 3059/95 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products (first series 1996)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community as amended\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community as amended\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 of 22 December 1994 on the common rules for imports and repealing Regulation (EC) No 518/94 as amended\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 of 13 December 1990 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances\nCommission Regulation (EEC) No 3769/92 of 21 December 1992 implementing and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 of 22 December 2004 laying down rules for the monitoring of trade between the Community and third countries in drug precursors\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 of 22 July 2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights\nRegulation (EC) No 1889/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community\nRegulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\nCommission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\nConvention between the European Economic Community, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Swiss Confederation, on a common transit procedure of 20 May 1987\nCouncil Decision 93/329/EEC of 15 March 1993 concerning the conclusion of the Convention on Temporary Admission and accepting its Annexes"}
