DEFINITION    1.1. Rear registration plate lamp\n\"Rear registration plate lamp\" means the device used to illuminate the space intended to accommodate the rear registration plate ; it may consist of different optical elements.\n(2.)\n(3.)\n(4.)\n5.  GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\nEach sample shall conform to the specifications set forth in section 9 (1).\nThese lamps shall be so designed that the entire surface to be illuminated is visible from the rear within the field of vision indicated in the drawing in Annex IV.\nAll measurements shall be carried out by adjusting the filament lamp or lamps of the device to the minimum light flux prescribed for the test voltage in the specification of the filament lamp or lamps for the device.\n6.  COLOUR OF LIGHT EMITTED\nThe colour of the light emitted by the lamp used in the device must be white, but sufficiently neutral so as not to cause any appreciable change in the colour of the registration plate.  (1)These specifications are such as to ensure good visibility if the inclination of the registration plate does not exceed 30\u00ba on either side of the vertical.\n7.  ANGLE OF INCIDENCE\nThe manufacturer of the device shall specify the position in which the device is to be fitted in relation to the space for the registration plate ; the device must be so placed that the angle of incidence of the light on the surface of the plate does not exceed 82\u00ba at any point on the surface to be illuminated, this angle being measured from the edge of the illuminating surface of the device furthest from the surface of the plate. Where a device incorporates several lamps, the foregoing requirement shall apply only to that part of the plate intended to be illuminated by the device concerned.\nThe device must be so designed that no light is emitted directly towards the rear, with the exception of red light if the device is combined or grouped with a rear lamp.\n8.  MEASURING PROCEDURE\nLuminance measurements shall be made on a piece of matte white blotting paper with a minimum diffuse reflection factor of 70 %, of the same dimensions as the registration plate, and placed in the position normally occupied by it 2 mm in front of its holder.\nLuminance measurements shall be made perpendicularly to the surface of the paper, at the points shown in Annex III according to the type of plate for which the device is intended, each point representing a circular area 25 mm in diameter.\n9.  PHOTOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS\nAt each of the points of measurement shown in Annex III, the luminance B shall be at least equal to 2 75 cd/m2.\nThe gradient of the luminance between the values B1 and B2, measured at any two points 1 and 2 selected from among those mentioned above, shall not exceed 2 \u00d7 B0/cm, B0 being the minimum luminance measured at the various points, that is to say: >PIC FILE= \"T0009405\">\n10.  CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION\nEvery rear registration plate lamp bearing an EEC component type-approval mark shall conform to the type approved.\nThe luminance B of any device picked at random from a series produced batch shall not be lower than 2 cd/m2 and, in the formula for the radient, the factor 2 may be replaced by 3.\n(11.)\nANNEX I EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL AND MARKING REQUIREMENTS\n1. APPLICATION FOR EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL      1.1. The application for EEC component type-approval shall be submitted by the holder of the trade name or mark or by his authorized representative.\n1.2. For each type of rear registration plate lamp, the application shall be accompanied by the following:        1.2.1. an indication as to whether the device is intended to illuminate a wide plate (520 \u00d7 120 mm), tall plate (340 \u00d7 240 mm) or both a wide and a tall plate;\n1.2.2. a brief technical specification stating the type and power of the filament lamp or lamps recommended by the manufacturer;\n1.2.3. drawings (three copies), in sufficient detail to permit identification of the type and showing geometrically the position in which the device is to be mounted in relation to the space to be occupied by the registration plate, and the outlines of the surface to be illuminated;\n1.2.4. two samples, equipped with the filament lamp or lamps recommended.\n2. MARKINGS      2.1. The samples of a type of rear registration plate lamp submitted for EEC component type-approval must bear the applicant's trade name or mark, which must be clearly legible and indelible.\n2.2. Each device shall include on both the lens and the lamp housing a space of sufficient size for the EEC component type-approval mark ; this space must be shown on the drawings mentioned in 1.2.3.\n3. EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL      3.1. If all the samples submitted in accordance with section 1 meet the requirements of sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Annex 0, EEC component type-approval shall be granted and a component type-approval number assigned.\n3.2. This number shall not be assigned to any other type of rear registration plate lamp.\n3.3. Where EEC component type-approval is requested for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a rear registration plate lamp and other lamps, a single EEC component type-approval mark may be issued provided that the rear registration plate lamp complies with the requirements of this Directive and that each of the other lamps forming part of the lighting and lightsignalling device for which EEC type-approval is requested, complies with the specific Directive applying to it.\n4. MARKS     4.1. Every rear registration plate lamp conforming to a type approved under this Directive shall bear an EEC component type-approval mark.\n4.2. This mark shall consist of a rectangle surrounding the lower case letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing letter(s) or number of the Member State which has granted the type-approval:\n1 for Germany,\n2 for France,\n3 for Italy,  4 for the Netherlands,\n6 for Belgium,\n11 for the United Kingdom,\n13 for Luxembourg,\nDK for Denmark,\nIRL for Ireland.\nIt must also include the EEC component type-approval number corresponding to the number of the EEC component type-approval certificate issued for the type of device in question.\n4.3. The EEC component type-approval number must be placed in any convenient position near the rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\".\n4.4. The EEC component type-approval mark must be affixed on the lens of the lamp or on one of the lenses in such a way as to be indelible and clearly legible even when the rear registration plate lamps are fitted on the vehicle.\n4.5. An example of an EEC component type-approval mark is shown in the Appendix.\n4.6. Where a single EEC type-approval number is issued, as under 3.3, for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising a rear registration plate lamp and other lamps, one EEC type-approval mark only may be affixed, consisting of:      - a rectangle surrounding the letter \"e\" followed by the distinguishing letter(s) or number of the Member State which has granted the EEC component type-approval,\n- the EEC component type-approval number,\n- the additional symbols required by the various Directives under which EEC component type-approval was granted.\n4.7. The dimensions of the various components of this mark must not be less than the largest of the minimum dimensions specified for individual markings by the various Directives under which the EEC component type-approval was granted.\nAppendix EXAMPLE OF AN EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009406\">  The device bearing the EEC component type-approval mark shown above is a rear registration plate lamp EEC type-approved in the United Kingdom (e 11) under the number 1471.\nANNEX II MODEL EEC TYPE-APPROVAL CERTIFICATE (Maximum format : A4 (210 \u00d7 297 mm))\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009407\">\nANNEX III MEASUREMENT POINTS FOR TEST PURPOSES\n(a) Devices for illuminating a tall plate (340 \u00d7 240 mm) >PIC FILE= \"T0009408\">\n(b) Devices for illuminating a wide plate (520 \u00d7 120 mm) >PIC FILE= \"T0009409\">\nNote : In the case of devices for illuminating both tall and wide plates the measurement points used are obtained by combining the two drawings above in accordance with the outline indicated by the maker or manufacturer ; however, if two measurement points are less than 30 mm apart, only one shall be used.\nANNEX IV MINIMUM FIELD OF VISIBILITY OF THE SURFACE TO BE ILLUMINATED\n>PIC FILE= \"T0009410\">     1. The field of visibility angles shown above relate only to the relative positions of the device and the space for the registration plate.\n(2.)\n3. The angles shown take account of the partial occultation caused by the device. These must be adhered to in the directions in which there is most occultation. The devices must be such as to reduce the areas partly occulted to the strict minimum necessary."}
