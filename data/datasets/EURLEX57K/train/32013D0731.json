The Commission also requested a revision of the calculation of the contribution to the TNP ceilings for multi-fuel fired plants.\n(6) By e-mail of 23 September 2013\u00a0(7) Ireland provided the requested additional information and clarifications, in conformity with Commission Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU\u00a0(8).\n(7) The TNP has therefore been assessed by the Commission in accordance with Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and with Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.\n(8) In particular, the Commission has examined the consistency and correctness of the data, assumptions and calculations used for determining the contributions of each of the combustion plants covered by the TNP to the emission ceilings set out in the TNP, and has analysed whether it contains objectives and related targets, measures and timetables for reaching these objectives and a monitoring mechanism to assess future compliance.\n(9) Further to the additional information submitted, the Commission found that the emission ceilings for the years 2016 and 2019 were calculated using the appropriate data and formulae and that the calculations were correct. Ireland has provided sufficient information regarding the measures that will be implemented in order to achieve the emission ceilings, the monitoring and the reporting to the Commission on the implementation of the TNP.\n(10) The Commission is satisfied that the Irish authorities have taken into consideration the provisions listed in Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and in Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.\n(11) The implementation of the TNP should be without prejudice to other applicable national and Union law. In particular, when setting individual permit conditions for the combustion plants covered by the TNP, Ireland should ensure that compliance with the requirements set out in, inter alia, Directive 2010/75/EU, Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(9) and Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(10) is not jeopardised.\n(12) Article 32(6) of Directive 2010/75/EU requires Ireland to inform the Commission of any subsequent changes to the TNP. The Commission should assess whether those changes comply with the provisions laid down in Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and in Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and of Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU, no objections are raised against the transitional national plan, which Ireland notified to the Commission on 31 December 2012 pursuant to Article 32(5) of Directive 2010/75/EU, as amended in accordance with the additional information sent on 10 July 2013 and 23 September 2013\u00a0(11).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The list of plants covered by the transitional national plan, the pollutants for which those plants are covered, and the applicable emission ceilings are laid down in the Annex.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The implementation of the transitional national plan by the Irish authorities shall not exempt Ireland from compliance with the provisions of Directive 2010/75/EU concerning the emissions from the individual combustion plants covered by the plan, and with other relevant bodies of the European Union environmental law.", "The Commission shall assess if any subsequent changes to the transitional national plan, notified by Ireland in the future, comply with the provisions listed in Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and in Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2013.\nFor the Commission\nJanez POTO\u010cNIK\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 334, 17.12.2010, p. 17.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0The notification by Ireland was received by letter dated 31 December 2012 sent to the Commission by mail on 31 December 2012 registered under number: Ares(2012)10636.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p. 1)\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Ares(2013) 1636798\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Ares(2013)2640846\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Ares(2013)2991162\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Ares(2013)3103789\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning the transitional national plans referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of European Parliament and the Council on industrial emissions (OJ L 52, 24.2.2012, p. 12)\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (OJ L 152, 11.6.2008, p. 1)\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p. 22)\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0The consolidated version of the TNP was registered by the Commission on 26 November 2013 under registration number Ares(2013)3571076.\nANNEX\nList of plants included in the TNP\nNumber Plant name in the TNP Total rated thermal input on 31.12.2010 (MW) Pollutants covered by the TNP\nSO2 NOx dust\n1 P0605-MP1/2 1\u00a0540 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n2 P0605-MP3 770 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n3 P0561-AD1 670 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n4 P0561-AT1 283 \u2014 \u221a \u2014\n5 P0561-AT2 283 \u2014 \u221a \u2014\n6 P0561-AT4 283 \u2014 \u221a \u2014\n7 P0578-MR1 277 \u2014 \u221a \u2014\n8 P0606-GR1/2 346 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n9 P0606-GR3 303 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n10 P0607-TB1/2 340 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n11 P0607-TB3/4 1\u00a0232 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n12 P0482-EP1 299 \u221a \u221a \u221a\nEmission ceilings (tonnes)\n2016 2017 2018 2019 1.1 \u2013 30.6.2020\nSO2 15\u00a0202 12\u00a0076 8\u00a0950 5\u00a0824 2\u00a0912\nNOx 8\u00a0811 7\u00a0853 6\u00a0896 5\u00a0938 2\u00a0969\ndust 1\u00a0514 1\u00a0196 878 560 280"}
