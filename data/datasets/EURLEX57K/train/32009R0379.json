That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening and sows to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1743/2006\u00a0(2) and for 10 years by Commission Regulation (EC) No 785/2007\u00a0(3) for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening and sows.\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of a new formulation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26, produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233), for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, ducks for fattening, piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening and sows.\n(6) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) stated in its opinion of 10\u00a0December 2008\u00a0(4), that its former opinion adopted on 17 October 2006\u00a0(5) fully applies to this new formulation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26. Therefore, the Authority concluded that the preparation 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26, new formulation, produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ATCC 5233), is effective for target species and it is safe for animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(7) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 May 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 329, 25.11.2006, p. 16.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 175, 5.7.2007, p. 5.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2008) 915, pp.\u00a01-10.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2006) 404, pp.\u00a01-20.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnit of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
