The amount of the Community contribution to the Fund should be EUR 15 million for each of the years 2003 and 2004, expressed in current values.\n(17) That support will contribute to reinforcing solidarity between the Member States and between their peoples.\n(18) The Treaty provides for no powers other than those in Article 308 thereof for the adoption of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["Subject to the annual budget procedure and in accordance with the second paragraph of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, an annual contribution of EUR 15 million shall be made to the Fund for each of the years 2003 and 2004, amounting to a total contribution of EUR 30 million.", "The contribution shall be used by the Fund in accordance with the Agreement under which it was established, priority being given to projects of a cross-border or cross-Community nature, in such a way as to complement the activities financed by the Community Structural Funds, and especially the activities of the PEACE Programme.\nIt shall be used in such a way as to bring about sustainable economic and social improvement in the areas concerned.
