Those factors include the vector species, climate conditions and the type of husbandry of the susceptible ruminants.\n(4) Therefore, as a transitional measure, Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 394/2008\u00a0(3) provides that, until 31 December 2008, Member States of destination may require that the movement of certain animals which are covered by the exemption provided for in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 be subjected to additional conditions, on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account the entomological and epidemiological conditions in which animals are being introduced.\n(5) In the period following the adoption of that transitional measure, experience has shown that in a number of Member States the application of the measures to ensure the protection of animals against attacks by vectors is not effective. In addition, the European Food Safety Authority states, in its Opinion on bluetongue of 19 June 2008\u00a0(4), that no treatment protocols have been formally approved in the Community for effectively protecting animals against Culicoides attacks.\n(6) In view of those circumstances and pending further scientific assessment, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of the transitional measure laid down in Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In the introductory phrase of paragraph 1 of Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, the date \u201831 December 2008\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2009\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0327, 22.12.2000, p.\u00a074.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0283, 27.10.2007, p.\u00a037.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0117, 1.5.2008, p.\u00a022.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the European Commission (DG SANCO) on Bluetongue.
