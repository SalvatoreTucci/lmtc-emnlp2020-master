Since the replacement of Directive 91/414/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this substance is deemed to have been approved under that Regulation and is listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\u00a0(5).\n(2) In accordance with Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, presented to the Commission its view on the draft review report for Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones\u00a0(6) on 13 December 2013. The Authority communicated its view on Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones to the notifier. The Commission invited it to submit comments on the draft review report for Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones. The draft review report and the view of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed and finalized on 11 July 2014 in the format of the Commission review report for Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones.\n(3) It is confirmed that the active substance Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(4) Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones is a group of pheromones naturally produced by insects of the order of Lepidoptera. They share a common structural definition and mechanism of action. The review report of Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones (SANCO/2633/2008) includes a list of individual compounds having the common structural definition of Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones and being contained in authorised plant protection products. That list will be updated, as appropriate.\n(5) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to amend the conditions of approval of Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromones. In particular, it is appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n(6) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0309, 24.11.2009, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L\u00a0230, 19.8.1991, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2008/127/EC of 18 December 2008 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include several active substances (OJ L\u00a0344, 20.12.2008, p.\u00a089).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 of 3 December 2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (OJ L\u00a0379, 24.12.2004, p.\u00a013).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L\u00a0153, 11.6.2011, p.\u00a01).\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0European Food Safety Authority.
