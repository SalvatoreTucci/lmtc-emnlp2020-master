By way of derogation of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, imports of goods shipped before 11 June 2005 shall also be released for free circulation upon the presentation of a surveillance document issued in accordance with Article 10a(2a) of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93.\nImport authorisations for goods shipped to the Community between 11 June 2005 and 12 July shall be granted automatically and cannot be denied on the grounds that there are no quantities available within the 2005 quantitative limits. However, the import of all products shipped from 11 June 2005 will be counted against the 2005 quantitative limits.\nThe granting of import authorisations will not require the presentation of the corresponding export licenses for goods shipped to the Community before China has put in place its export licensing system (20 July 2005).\nApplications for import licences for the import, from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, of goods that have been shipped between 11 June 2005 and 19 July 2005 (inclusive) shall be presented to the competent authorities of a Member State no later than 20 September 2005.\nGoods shipped before 12 July do not need to have been shipped directly to the Community to benefit from the exemption of quantitative limits, although the competent authorities of the Community may deny such benefits if they have reasons to suspect that they have been shipped to another destination before 12 July in order to circumvent this Regulation, in case such transactions do not respond to normal business practices or purely logistical reasons. By way of example, are considered as corresponding to a normal conduct of business goods shipped to distribution centres for the importing companies, or when the importer can present a contract or letter of credit preceding the date of shipment, or when the goods have been transhipped outside China onto another means of transport within a reasonably short period of time.\nThe increases to the agreed levels introduced by the Regulation are made available to enable the issuance of import licences for goods shipped to the Community between 13 and 19 July 2005, or for goods shipped to the Community after 20 July 2005 with a valid Chinese export licence, which are in excess of the agreed levels introduced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1084/2005 (OJ L 177, 9.7.2005, p. 19) in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93.\nShould any goods shipped to the Community between 13 and 19 July 2005 exceed these levels, the Commission may authorise the issuance of further import licences after informing the Textiles Committee, and after effecting the transfer of 2\u00a0072\u00a0924 kg of products of category 2 as provided for in Annex VIII.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See Appendix A.\nANNEX II\nIn Annex VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 the table is replaced by the following:\n\u2018TABLE\nCOMMUNITY QUANTITATIVE LIMITS FOR GOODS REIMPORTED UNDER OPT\nCommunity quantitative limits\nThird country Category Unit 2006\nBelarus GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces 5\u00a0055\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces 7\u00a0047\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces 9\u00a0398\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces 7\u00a0054\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces 2\u00a0402\nGROUP IIB\n12 1\u00a0000 pairs 4\u00a0749\n13 1\u00a0000 pieces 744\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces 4\u00a0120\n16 1\u00a0000 pieces 839\n21 1\u00a0000 pieces 2\u00a0741\n24 1\u00a0000 pieces 706\n26/27 1\u00a0000 pieces 3\u00a0434\n29 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0392\n73 1\u00a0000 pieces 5\u00a0337\n83 tonnes 709\nGROUP IIIB\n74 1\u00a0000 pieces 931\nSerbia\u00a0(1) GROUP IB\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces\nGROUP IIB\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces\n16 1\u00a0000 pieces\nVietnam\u00a0(2) GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces\n8 1\u00a0000 pieces\nGROUP IIB\n12 1\u00a0000 pairs\n13 1\u00a0000 pieces\n15 1\u00a0000 pieces\n18 tonnes\n21 1\u00a0000 pieces\n26 1\u00a0000 pieces\n31 1\u00a0000 pieces\n68 tonnes\n76 tonnes\n78 tonnes\nThird country Category Unit Specific agreed levels\n11 June to 31 December 2005\u00a0(3) 2006 2007\nChina GROUP IB\n4 1\u00a0000 pieces 208 408 449\n5 1\u00a0000 pieces 453 886 975\n6 1\u00a0000 pieces 1\u00a0642 3\u00a0216 3\u00a0538\n7 1\u00a0000 pieces 439 860 946\nGROUP IIB\n26 1\u00a0000 pieces 791 1\u00a0550 1\u00a0705\n31 1\u00a0000 pieces 6\u00a0301 12\u00a0341 13\u00a0575\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative restrictions for Serbia do not apply pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and Serbia on trade in textile products (OJ L 90, 8.4.2005, p. 36).
