Those preferences took the form of a gradual reduction of Common Customs Tariff duties and, from 1978 to 31 December 1994, the complete suspension of the duties.\n(2) Since the entry into force of the GSP in 1995, the Union has, alongside the GATT, opened autonomous zero-duty Union tariff quotas for specific quantities of jute and coconut-fibre products. The tariff quotas opened for those products under Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 were extended until 31 December 2013 by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 17/2012\u00a0(2).\n(3) As a new GSP is to apply from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2023 under Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), the tariff quota arrangement for jute and coconut-fibre products should be extended accordingly.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["The fifth column (\u2018Quota period\u2019) of the table in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 is amended as follows:\n(1) the text for serial number 09.0107 is replaced by the following:\n(2) the text for serial number 09.0109 is replaced by the following:\n(3) the text for serial number 09.0111 is replaced by the following:", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 5, 8.1.2000, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 17/2012 of 11 January 2012 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 as regards the extension of the tariff quotas of the Union for jute and coconut-fibre products (OJ L 8, 12.1.2012, p. 31).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 (OJ L 303, 31.10.2012, p. 1)."}
