The measure would release those taxable persons from certain or all of the obligations in relation to value added tax (VAT) referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of the VAT Directive.\n(2) By letter dated 6 June 2014, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Lithuania. By letter dated 12 June 2014, the Commission notified Lithuania that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3) A special scheme for small enterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of the VAT Directive. The extended measure derogates from Title XII of the VAT Directive only in so far as the taxable person's annual turnover threshold for the special scheme is higher than that allowed for Lithuania under Article 287(11) of the VAT Directive, which is EUR 29\u00a0000.\n(4) By Council Implementing Decision 2011/335/EU,\u00a0(2) Lithuania was authorised, as a derogating measure, to exempt taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 45\u00a0000 until 31 December 2014. Given that this threshold has resulted in reduced VAT obligations for smaller businesses, Lithuania should be authorised to extend the measure for a further limited period. Taxable persons may still opt for the normal VAT arrangements.\n(5) From information provided by Lithuania, the extension of the derogation will only have a negligible impact on the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the final stage of consumption.\n(6) The derogation has no impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["In the second paragraph of Article 2 of Implementing Decision 2011/335/EU, the date \u201831 December 2014\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2017\u2019.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 November 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP.
