In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.\n(2) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC\u00a0(4) provides for an alternative system to quarantine for the entry of certain domestic carnivores into the territory of certain Member States free from rabies. That system requires checks on the effectiveness of the vaccination of those animals by titration of antibodies.\n(3) The AFSSA Laboratory in Nancy, France, was designated by Decision 2000/258/EC as the institute responsible for establishing the criteria necessary for standardising the serological tests to monitor the effectiveness of rabies vaccination.\n(4) A proficiency testing procedure has been established for rabies antibody titration of vaccinated domestic carnivores in the context of alternative measures to quarantine.\n(5) The AFSSA Laboratory, Nancy, has to operate the established proficiency testing procedure to appraise laboratories for approval to perform serological tests on certain carnivores vaccinated against rabies.\n(6) Several Member States have submitted applications for approval of laboratories to perform analyses to check the effectiveness of vaccination against rabies in certain domestic carnivores.\n(7) The AFSSA Laboratory, Nancy, has made an appraisal of the applications received from the Member States and sent the result of this appraisal to the Commission.\n(8) The Commission can draw up a list, based on appraisal results, of laboratories authorised to carry out serological titration on carnivores vaccinated against rabies.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The laboratories presented by Member States and authorised to perform analyses to check the effectiveness of vaccination against rabies in certain domestic carnivores are listed in Annex\u00a0I.", "Decision 2001/296/EC is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Decision shall be construed as references to this Decision and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid BYRNE\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 79, 30.3.2000, p. 40.
