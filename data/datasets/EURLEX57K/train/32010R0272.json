To this respect, this provision does not indicate any tolerance for the presence of rice not corresponding to the varieties listed in Annex XVIII to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(5) The conditions of production and trade of Basmati rice make highly difficult to guarantee that any single lot is made out of 100\u00a0% of Basmati rice of the varieties listed in Annex XVIII to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. In order to allow smooth trade flows of Basmati into the European Union, and considering that the DNA-based Union control system is not operational yet and therefore the Member States can apply their own control protocols with at least 5\u00a0% uncertainty on the checks being cumulative upon any tolerance level, it is appropriate to establish a 5\u00a0% tolerance for the presence in the imported Basmati of long grain rice not corresponding to any of the varieties listed in that Annex XVIII.\n(6) In order to extend the positive impact of this measure to all concerned importers, it should be provided that the tolerance is applicable to all Basmati imports for which a final decision on the eligibility of the lot has not yet been made by the responsible authorities of the Member States.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 972/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Market,", "main_body": ["In Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 972/2006, the following sentence is added:\n\u2018However, the presence up to 5\u00a0% of husked rice falling within CN code 1006\u00a020\u00a017 or CN code 1006\u00a020\u00a098 not corresponding to any of the varieties listed in Annex XVIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007\u00a0(7) shall be accepted.", "Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 972/2006 as amended by Article 1 of this Regulation shall also apply to Basmati imports carried out before the entry into force of this Regulation for which the competent authorities of the Member State have not yet finally established the eligibility to zero duty provided for in Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "shall cease to apply at the end of the 12th month following entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 March 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 279, 28.8.2004, p. 19.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 279, 28.8.2004, p. 17.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 279, 28.8.2004, p. 25.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 279, 28.8.2004, p. 23.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 176, 30.6.2006, p. 53.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0299, 16.11.2007, p.\u00a01.\u2019"}
