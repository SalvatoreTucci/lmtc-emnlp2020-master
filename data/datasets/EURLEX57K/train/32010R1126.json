This Article also provides for the establishment of a transitional period of at least three years before the removal takes effect.\n(3) Cape Verde was excluded by the United Nations from the list of least-developed countries, with effect from 1 January 2008\u00a0(2).\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/2007\u00a0(3) provides for Cape Verde\u2019s removal from the list of beneficiaries of the special arrangement for least developed countries with effect from 1 January 2011 after the expiry of a three-year transitional period.\n(5) The transitional period granted under Regulation (EC) No 1547/2007, coming in a time of economic crisis, was marked by declining trade volumes that hampered Cape Verde\u2019s economic diversification efforts. Hence, this transitional period has not allowed the time necessary for Cape Verde to overcome the over-reliance on one key export sector and thus alleviate potential adverse effects of the removal from the EBA scheme. That period should therefore be extended until 1 January 2012.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Generalised Preferences Committee,", "main_body": ["Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1547/2007 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 1\nThe Republic of Cape Verde shall be removed from the list of beneficiaries of the special arrangement for the least-developed countries in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, with effect from 1 January 2012.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 211, 6.8.2008, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0UN General Assembly Resolution A/Res/59/210 of 20 December 2004.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 337, 21.12.2007, p. 70."}
