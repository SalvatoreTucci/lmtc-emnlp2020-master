whereas, pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 19 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 and Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93, the competent authorities must establish the quantity to be allocated to each operator in the  abovementioned categories for 1995;\nWhereas, the total of the reference quantities thus calculated is 2 642 484 tonnes for Category A operators and 1 395 324 tonnes for Category B operators; whereas, therefore, Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93 should be applied to ensure  compliance with the tariff quota opened for 1995 and the single reduction coefficient to be applied to the reference quantity of operators in each of the abovementioned categories to determine the quantity to be allocated to each of those operators for  1995 should be fixed;\nWhereas the notifications made by the Member States pursuant to Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93 concerning the total reference quantities allocated to operators registered with them and of the quantities of bananas marketed in respect of  each activity by those operators reveal that the same quantities marketed in respect of the same activity have been counted twice for different operators in several Member States; and an incorrect application of the criteria for determining the  activities giving right to an allocation from the tariff quota;\nWhereas the use of the abovementioned figures as notified by certain Member States would lead, to the determination, pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93, of an excessively high single reduction coefficient to the disadvantage of certain  operators;\nWhereas, given the impossibility of assessing the quantities counted twice with sufficient accuracy and that the reference quantities are based on an incorrect application of the rules, the reduction coefficients should be determined on a provisional  basis (on the basis of the notifications already received from the Member States); whereas definitive reference quantities for operators for 1995 cannot be determined using those coefficients; whereas those quantities can only be laid down after further  checks have been made by the Member States in cooperation with the Commission;\nWhereas, in order to meet the deadlines, this measure should enter into force on the day of its publication;\nWhereas Management Committee for Bananas has not issued an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The provisional quantity to be allocated to each operator in Categories A and B for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1995 within the tariff quota referred to in Articles 18 and 19 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 shall be calculated by  applying to the operator's reference quantity, determined in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93, the following single reduction coefficients:\n- for each Category A operator: 0,503314,\n- for each Category B operator: 0,430008.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThe provisions of this Regulation shall apply without prejudice to any corrections made subsequent to amendments to notifications made by the Member States.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 December 1994.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 47, 25. 2. 1993, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 320, 22. 12. 1993, p. 15.\n(3) OJ No L 142, 12. 6. 1993, p. 6.\n(4) OJ No L 261, 11. 10. 1994, p. 3."}
