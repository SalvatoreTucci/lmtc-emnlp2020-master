If a region is free of foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination, imports of bone-in fresh meat is allowed, whereas if the region is free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination, then only de-boned and matured meat may be imported into the Community. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) determines the foot-and-mouth disease status of the OIE member countries and the Commission\u2019s inspections verify the animal health status of third countries and their ability to meet Community requirements.\n(4) In July 2008, the status of free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination was reinstated by the OIE for the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso do Sul.\n(5) Considering the free of foot-and-mouth disease status of Mato Grosso do Sul, and considering the results of the Commission\u2019s inspections carried out in Brazil, that State should be re-included in the list of territories from which imports into the Community of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat are authorised under the uniform conditions applicable to the other Brazilian States free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination and currently authorised for such imports into the Community.\n(6) Certain parts of the Brazilian States of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais are at present not included in the list of territories in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC from which imports into the Community of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat are authorised. However, the entirety of those States is recognised by the OIE as free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination. In addition, the results of the Commission\u2019s inspections carried out in Brazil provided sufficient guarantees as regards the animal health controls in place in the entirety of the States of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais, in particular taking into account the system of specifically approved farms. Based on the OIE recognition and on those guarantees, it is opportune to include the entirety of the States of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais in the list of territories from which imports into the Community of fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat are authorised.\n(7) The State of Mato Grosso do Sul and all parts of the States of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso will be allowed to export fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat under the uniform conditions applicable to the Brazilian States free of foot-and-mouth disease with vaccination and currently authorised for such imports into the Community.\n(8) Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "Consignments of fresh de-boned and matured beef from the territory with code BR-1 as defined in Commission Decision 2008/642/EC\u00a0(3) from animals slaughtered before 1 December 2008 may be imported into the Community until 14 January 2009.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 December 2008.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 November 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 146, 14.6.1979, p. 15.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 207, 5.8.2008, p. 36.\nANNEX\n\u2018PART 1\nList of third countries or parts thereof\u00a0(1)\nCountry Code of Territory Description of territory Veterinary certificate Specific conditions Closing date\u00a0(2) Opening date\u00a0(3)\nModel(s) SG\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nAL \u2014 Albania AL-0 Whole country \u2014\nAR \u2014 Argentina AR-0 Whole country EQU\nAR-1 The provinces of: Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes (except the departments of Ber\u00f3n de Astrada, Capital, Empedrado, General Paz, Itati, Mbucuruy\u00e1, San Cosme and San Lu\u00eds del Palmar), Entre R\u00edos, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Part of Neuqu\u00e9n (excluding territory included in AR-4), part of R\u00edo Negro (excluding territory included in AR-4), San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe, Tucuman, Cordoba, La Pampa, Santiago del Estero, Chaco Formosa, Jujuy and Salta, excluding the buffer area of 25 km from the border with Bolivia and Paraguay that extends from the Santa Catalina District in the Province of Jujuy, to the Laishi District in the Province of Formosa BOV A 1  18 March 2005\nRUF A 1  1 December 2007\nAR-2 Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego BOV, OVI, RUW, RUF    1 March 2002\nAR-3 Corrientes: the departments of Ber\u00f3n de Astrada, Capital, Empedrado, General Paz, Itati, Mbucuruy\u00e1, San Cosme and San Lu\u00eds del Palmar BOV A 1  1 December 2007\nAR-4 Part of R\u00edo Negro (except: in Avellaneda the zone located north of the Provincial road 7 and east of the Provincial road 250, in Conesa the zone located east of the Provincial road 2, in El Cuy the zone located north of the Provincial road 7 from its intersection with the Provincial road 66 to the border with the Department of Avellaneda, and in San Antonio the zone located east of the Provincial roads 250 and 2), part of Neuqu\u00e9n (except in Confluencia the zone located east of the Provincial road 17, and in Picun Leuf\u00fa the zone located east of the Provincial road 17) BOV, OVI, RUW, RUF    1 August 2008\nAU \u2014 Australia AU-0 Whole country BOV, OVI, POR, EQU, RUF, RUW, SUF, SUW\nBA \u2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina BA-0 Whole country \u2014\nBH \u2014 Bahrain BH-0 Whole country \u2014\nBR \u2014 Brazil BR-0 Whole country EQU\nBR-1 State of Minas Gerais, State of Esp\u00edrito Santo, State of Goi\u00e1s, State of Mato Grosso, State of Rio Grande Do Sul, State of Mato Grosso Do Sul (except for the designated high surveillance zone of 15 km from the external borders in the municipalities of Porto Mutinho, Bela Vista, Ponta Por\u00e3, Aral Moreira, Coronel Sapucaia, Paranhos, Sete Quedas, Japor\u00e3 and Mundo Novo and the designated high surveillance zone in the municipalities of Corumb\u00e1 and Lad\u00e1rio).
