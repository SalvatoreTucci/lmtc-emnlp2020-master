To harmonise procedures and avoid the use of different supporting documents for olive oil and table olives, the same standard crop declaration should be used.\n(2) Article 3 of Decision 2001/649/EC lays down the coefficient of equivalence between olive oil and table olives at 13 kilograms of oil for every 100 kilograms of olives. However, there are some dehydrated table olive preparations that differ from that coefficient considerably. A different coefficient should be laid down for those particular preparations that takes account of the significant loss of humidity in processed olives.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Decision 2001/649/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
