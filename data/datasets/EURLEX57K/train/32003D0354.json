This measure is a derogation from Article 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC, as amended by Article 28f of that Directive and is justified by the need to simplify the procedure for charging VAT; it affects the amount of tax due at the final consumption stage only to a negligible extent.\n(4) The authorisation expired on 31 December 2002, although the legal situation and the facts which justified application of the simplification measure in question have not changed and continue to exist.\n(5) The duration of the new authorisation should however be limited to 30 June 2004. This maximum period will allow the derogation to be evaluated in the light of the ruling on Case C-17/01, which the Court will probably deliver in the course of 2003.\n(6) The derogation will not adversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 17(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC Germany is authorised to exclude expenditure on goods and services from the right to deduct VAT when the goods and services in question are used more than 90 % for the private purposes of a taxable person or of his employees, or, more generally, for non-business purposes.", "This Decision shall apply until 30 June 2004.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 May 2003.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
