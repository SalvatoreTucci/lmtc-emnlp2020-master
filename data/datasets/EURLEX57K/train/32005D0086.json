The contingency plan includes a withdrawal scheme in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 93/53/EEC. The contingency plan, including vaccination procedures, and withdrawal scheme submitted in September 2004 have been approved by the subgroup.\n(4) In the light of the disease situation in the Faroe Islands and the implementation of a control strategy including vaccination, the protective measures provided for in Decision 2003/71/EC should remain applicable as long as vaccination is applied. The vaccination is expected to remain as the control strategy for at least the next two years.\n(5) Decision 2003/71/EC should therefore be amended in order to extend its period of validity.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Decision 2003/71/EC, \u201831 January 2005\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 January 2007\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 24.9.1991, p. 56.
