SPECIFIC CRITERIA OF PURITY\nE 101 - Lactoflavin (Riboflavin)\nLumiflavin : Prepare ethanol-free chloroform as follows : Shake 20 ml of chloroform with 20 ml of water gently but carefully for three minutes and allow time to separate. Draw off the chloroform layer and repeat the operation twice using 20 ml each time. Finally, filter the chloroform through dry filter paper, shake the filtrate well for five minutes with 5 g of powdered anhydrous sodium sulphate, leave the mixture to settle for two hours, then decant or filter the clear chloroform. Shake 25 mg of riboflavin with 10 ml of ethanol-free chloroform for five minutes, then filter : the colour of the filtrate should not be more intense than that of an aqueous solution obtained by diluting 3 ml of 0 71 N potassium dichromate to 1000 ml.\nE 102 - Tartazine\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 1 %\nE 103 - Chrysoine S\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 104 - Quinoline Yellow\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 105 - Fast Yellow AB\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 3 %\nUnsulphonated aromatic amines and aniline : not more than 10 mg/kg    (a) Determination of 2-aminoazobenzene and 4-aminoazobenzene : Dissolve 20 70 g of Fast  Yellow AB in 400 ml of water and add 5 ml of N sodium hydroxide. Shake in a separating  funnel with four successive portions of 50 ml of chlorobenzene, for five minutes each time.  Wash the combined chlorobenzene extracts with successive amounts of 400 ml of 0 71 N  sodium hydroxide until the upper aqueous layer remains colourless. Filter the chlorobenzene  solution through a thickly-folded filter paper and measure the extinction (E1) in a  spectrophotometer against chlorobenzene contained in cells of suitable thickness (d1) at  414 m\u00b6.\nCalculation: >PIC FILE= \"T0050799\">\nNote: >PIC FILE= \"T0050800\">\nThe aminoazobenzene content can be determined only up to 90 %. It is possible to separate  the 2- and 4- compounds by the following method. Concentrate 100 ml of chlorobenzene  extract to about 20 ml by heating in a water bath in a current of warm air. Pour the concentrated  solution on a column of alumina (of appropriate size). Elute with chlorobenzene.  The first 100 ml of the chlorobenzene eluate contains the 2-aminoazobenzene. The para  compound of the chlorobenzene is then eluted. Dilute the two solutions to 100 ml. Measure  the extinction of the ortho-compound at 414 m\u00b6 (E2), and that of the para-compound at  376 m\u00b6 (E3). >PIC FILE= \"T0050801\">\n(b) Determination of aniline : Shake 75 ml of the remaining chlorobenzene extract with two  successive portions of 50 ml of 0 75 N hydrochloric acid, then with two successive portions  of 25 ml of water. Neutralise the combined aqueous extracts with a 30 % solution of sodium  hydroxide, then acidify with 10 ml of 0 75 N hydrochloric acid. Dissolve 1-2 g of potassium  bromide in this solution. After cooling in iced water, add about 20 drops of 0 71 N sodium  nitrate and leave to settle for ten minutes. Remove the excess nitrite by the addition of  sulphamic acid. Pour the solution into about 5 ml of a 3 % solution of R salt (disodium salt  of 2-naphthol-3, 6-disulphonic acid) added to 10 ml of 2 N sodium hydroxide. Leave to  settle for fifteen minutes. Acidify the solution of the dyestuff with Congo Red TS (indicator)  until the latter turns blue, and filter. The aminoazobenzene dyestuff will remain on the  filter. Dilute the filtrate to 200 ml, then measure the extinction at 490 m\u00b6 or E4.\nCalculation: >PIC FILE= \"T0050802\">\nE 110 - Orange Yellow S, Sunset Yellow FCF\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 111 - Orange GGN\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 120 - Cochineal, carminic acid\nPaper chromatography : with a solution of 2 g of trisodium citrate in 100 ml 5 % ammonium hydroxide, cochineal gives only a single stain in the alkaline zone.\nE 122 - Azorubin, Carmoisine\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 1 %\nE 123 - Amaranth\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 124 - Cochineal Red A, Ponceau 4 R\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 125 - Scarlet GN\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nE 126 - Ponceau 6 R\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 3 %\nE 131 - Patent Blue V\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 75 %\nChromium (estimated as CR) : not more than 20 mg/kg\nAccessory colourings : not more than 1 %\nE 132 - Indigotin indigo carmine\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 1 %\nIsatinsulphonic acid : not more than 1 %\nE 141 - Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins\nA 1 % solution of copper chlorophyll complex in turpentine should not be turbid and should not form a sediment.\nCopper (free ionisable Cu) : not more than 200 mg/kg\nE 151 - Brilliant Black BN, Black PN\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nAccessory colourings : not more than 15 %. (The presence of accessory colourings among which the diacetylised compound has been identified is essential in order to obtain the precise shade.)\nIntermediate products : not more than 1 %\nE 152 - Black 7984\nProducts insoluble in water : not more than 0 72 %\nLead : not more than 10 mg/kg\nArsenic : not more than 2 mg/kg\nE 153 - Carbo medicinalis vegetalis (charcoal)\nHigher aromatic hydrocarbons : Extract 1 g of carbon black with 10 g of pure cyclohexane for two hours. The extract should be colourless. It should have little or no fluorescence in ultra-violet light ; on evaporation it should leave no residue.\nTarry products : boil 2 g of carbon black with 20 ml of N sodium hydroxide, then filter. The filtrate should be colourless.\nE 160  (a) - Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-Carotene\nChromatography : By absorption on alumina or silica gel, pure Beta-carotene shows only one  zone.\nE 160  (b) - Bixin and Norbixin (Roucou, Annatto)\nChromatography:      (a) Annatto : Dissolve a sufficient quantity of Annatto in benzene or dilute a benzene solution of  Annatto to obtain a solution of the same colour as a 1 % solution of potassium dichromate.  Pour 3 ml of the solution on the top of an alumina column ; elute slowly. Wash the column  three times with benzene. The bixin is very heavily absorbed on the surface of the alumina  and forms a brilliant orange-red zone (as distinct from crocetin saffron). A very pale yellow  zone usually moves very rapidly across the column, even with crystallised pure bixin. The  bixin cannot be eluted in benzene, light petroleum, ether, chloroform, acetone, etharol or  methanol. But the ethanol and methanol cause the orange tint to turn into an orange yellow.\nCarr-Price reaction : Remove the benzene from the column by washing three times with  chloroform previously dehydrated by means of potassium carbonate. After elution of the  last chloroform wash, add 5 ml of the Carr-Price reagent to the top of the column. The bixin  zone immediately turns to blue-green (as distinct from crocetin).\n(b) Bixin : Dissolve 1 to 2 mg of crystallised bixin in 20 ml of chloroform. Add 5 ml of this  solution to the top of the prepared column. Rinse the solution with chloroform previously  dehydrated with sodium carbonate and proceed as for (a) (Carr-Price reaction).\n(c) Alkaline solutions of norbixin : Place 2 ml of an aqueous solution of Annatto in a 50 ml  separating funnel. Add sufficient 2 N sulphuric acid to obtain a highly acid reaction. The  norbixin will separate out as a red precipitate. Add 50 ml of benzene, then shake vigorously.  After separation discard the aqueous layer and wash the benzene solution with 100 ml of  water until the solution is no longer acid. Centrifuge the solution (usually emulsified) of  norbixin in benzene for ten minutes at 2500 revolutions per minute. Decant the clear norbixin  solution and dehydrate by means of anhydrous sodium sulphate. Pour 3-5 ml of this  solution on the top of the alumina column. Norbixin like bixin will form an orange-red  zone on the surface of the alumina. When eluted as in (a), it will behave like bixin and will  also give the Carr-Price reaction.\nE 162 - Beetroot red, betanin\nPaper Chromatography : With butanol saturated with 2 N hydrochloric acid as a solvent (ascending chromatography), betanin gives a single red spot with a brownish trail and little migration.\nE 171 - Titanium dioxide\nSubstances soluble in hydrochloric acid : Suspend 5 g of titanium dioxide in 100 ml of 0 75 N hydrochloric acid and heat for thirty minutes in a water bath, stirring from time to time. Filter in a Gooch crucible on the bottom of which three layers have been placed, the first of coarse asbestos the second of filter paper reduced to a pulp and the third of fine asbestos. Wash with three successive portions of 0 75 N hydrochloric acid each of 10 ml. Evaporate the filtrate to dryness in a platinum evaporating dish, then heat to a dull red until the weight is constant. The weight of the residue should not exceed 0 70175 g.\nAntimony : not more than 100 mg/kg\nZinc : not more than 50 mg/kg\nSoluble barium compounds : not more than 5 mg/kg\nE 172 - Iron oxides and hydroxides\nSelenium : not more than 1 mg/kg\nMercury : not more than 1 mg/kg\nE 181 - Burnt umber\nManganese oxides computed on the basis of Mn3O4 : not more than 8 %\nOrganic matters not completely burnt : Boil 2 g of burnt umber in 30 ml of a 20 % solution of potassium hydroxide, then filter.
