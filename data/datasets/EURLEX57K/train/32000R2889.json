The controls imposed on such materials should therefore be abolished.\n(4) In the 1984 Dublin Declaration on common policy, however, the Member States acknowledged the need for intra-Community controls on transfers of goods regarded as particularly sensitive in the context of weapons non-proliferation. Controls on certain special fissile materials under item 0C002 (separated plutonium and \"uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233\" to more than 20 %) should therefore remain in place.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 is amended as follows:\n1. In Annex II, Part 2, after the first indent, the following indents shall be inserted:\n\"- 0C001 'natural uranium' or 'depleted uranium' or thorium in the form of metal, alloy, chemical compound or concentrate and any other material containing one or more of the foregoing;\n- 0C002 'special fissile materials' other than those specified in Annex IV;\n- 0D001 (software) and OE001 (technology) insofar as these relate to 0C001 or to those items of 0C002 that are excluded from Annex IV.\"\n2.
