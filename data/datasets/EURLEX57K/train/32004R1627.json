Article 6(7) of the 2003 Act of Accession establishes that the new Member States are to apply the common trade policy concerning textiles and that the quantitative restrictions applied by the Community on imports of textile and clothing products are to be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the Community.\n(2) With effect from 1 May 2004, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93\u00a0(1) was last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 487/2004\u00a0(2). It adjusted the quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products from third countries into the enlarged Community, taking into account traditional imports into the 10 new Member States and using a formula of the average imports of years 2000 to 2002 adjusted pro rata temporis. This same methodology should now be applied to adjust the quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) It is desirable for this Regulation to enter into force on the day after its publication in order to allow operators to benefit from it as soon as possible,", "main_body": ["In Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93, the Community quantitative limits for Vietnam for 2004 set out in Annex V and in Annex VII to that Regulation shall be replaced by the Community quantitative limits set out in Part A and Part B of the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 September 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nB.
