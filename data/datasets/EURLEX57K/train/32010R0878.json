In particular, Annex I thereto must be reviewed by removing those commodities for which the above information sources show an overall satisfactory degree of compliance with the relevant EU safety requirements and for which an increased level of official control is therefore no longer justified, and by adding other commodities for which the same sources show a degree of non-compliance with the relevant EU safety requirements that warrants the introduction of increased level of official controls.\n(4) The amendments to Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 provided for in this Regulation should become applicable as soon as possible so that the increased level of official controls can, on one hand, cease for those commodities which are removed from the list and, on the other hand, start for those newly added.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 7 October 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 October 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0165, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0194, 25.7.2009, p.\u00a011.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(6) Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), in shell\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), shelled\n\u2014 Peanut butter\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved\n(Feed and food)\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), in shell\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), shelled\n\u2014 Peanut butter\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved\n(Feed and food)\nDried Noodles ex\u00a01902 China Aluminium 10\nTrace elements\u00a0(7) ex\u00a02817\u00a000\u00a000;
