Therefore, it is appropriate that that Implementing Decision applies without a limitation of time.\n(3) Experience shows that it is necessary to grant greater flexibility as regards the facility where the potato tubers undergo treatment ensuring that no more than 0,1 % of soil remains on them and that the specified organisms are removed. Therefore, it should be permitted that those tubers are moved outside the demarcated areas before that treatment takes place. The movement to those facilities should, however, be subject to requirements ensuring that the respective phytosanitary risk is reduced to acceptable levels.\n(4) In order to ensure that the specified organisms cannot establish or spread outside a demarcated area, requirements should be established concerning disposal of the relevant waste soil and other waste material. For the same purpose, requirements should also be established concerning vehicles and packaging for the transport or handling of those potato tubers before they move outside the demarcated area or from a packing facility located outside that area. It is also necessary that machinery used for the handling of potato tubers in the packing facilities located outside demarcated areas is cleaned to avoid infestation of other potatoes handled by the same machinery.\n(5) In order to facilitate control by Member States of the packing outside a demarcated area of potato tubers originating in such an area, it is important that packing facilities located outside demarcated areas are authorised for that purpose and required to keep records of the potato tubers handled which originate in demarcated areas.\n(6) Implementing Decision 2012/270/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Implementing Decision 2012/270/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 3 is replaced by the following:\n(a) intensive monitoring for the presence of the specified organisms through appropriate inspections on potato plants and, where appropriate, other host plants, including fields where those plants are growing, within at least a radius of 100 m of the packing facility;\n(b) activities to raise public awareness concerning the threat of the specified organisms and the measures adopted to prevent its introduction into and spread within the Union in the vicinity of the packing facility.\n(a) before they are moved outside the demarcated area; and\n(b) before they leave a packing facility, as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 3(1).\n(a) they are authorised by the responsible official body to pack potato tubers originating in a demarcated area; and\n(b) they keep, for one year from the time of arrival of the potato tubers at that facility, records of the potato tubers handled which originate in demarcated areas.\u2019\n(2) Article 7 is deleted;\n(3) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 September 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0169, 10.7.2000, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Decision 2012/270/EU of 16 May 2012 as regards emergency measures to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Union of Epitrix cucumeris (Harris), Epitrix similaris (Gentner), Epitrix subcrinita (Lec.) and Epitrix tuberis (Gentner) (OJ\u00a0L\u00a0132, 23.5.2012, p.\u00a018).\nANNEX\nAnnex I to Implementing Decision 2012/270/EU is amended as follows:\nSection 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018SECTION 2\nConditions for movement\n(1) Potato tubers originating in demarcated areas within the Union may be moved from such areas into non-demarcated areas within the Union only if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a) the potato tubers have been grown in a registered place of production in accordance with Commission Directive 92/90/EEC\u00a0(1) or by a registered producer in accordance with Commission Directive 93/50/EEC\u00a0(2), or moved from a warehouse or a dispatching centre registered in accordance with Directive 93/50/EEC;\n(b) the potato tubers have been washed or brushed so that there is no more than 0,1 % of soil remaining or have undergone an equivalent method specifically applied in order to achieve the same outcome and remove the specified organisms concerned and to ensure that there is no risk of spreading the specified organisms;\n(c) the packaging material in which potato tubers are moved is clean;
