On 8 December 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted an International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (International Tracing Instrument). Both these international instruments declare that States will cooperate, as appropriate, with the United Nations to support their effective implementation.\n(2) The 2008 Third Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action noted in its final report the importance of regional approaches to the implementation of the Programme of Action and the usefulness, therefore, of convening regional meetings sponsored by interested States and international, regional and sub-regional organisations in a position to do so. The final report also encouraged States to support and make full use of existing mechanisms that support the implementation of the Programme of Action and the matching of needs with resources, such as the Programme of Action Implementation Support System.\n(3) On 15-16 December 2005, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition (the EU SALW Strategy). The EU SALW Strategy identifies support for the UN Programme of Action as the first priority for action at international level, and calls for the adoption of a legally binding international instrument on the tracing and marking of SALW and ammunition.\n(4) Following the adoption of the international tracing instrument, the European Union supported its full implementation through the adoption and implementation of Council Joint Action 2008/113/CFSP of 12 February 2008 in support of the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW)\u00a0(1). The implementation of that Joint Action was positively assessed by the Council of the European Union.\n(5) On 2 December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/64/50 on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects which encourages all initiatives, including those of international, regional and sub-regional organisations, for the successful implementation of the Programme of Action and emphasises that initiatives by the international community with respect to international cooperation and assistance remain essential and complementary to national implementation efforts.\n(6) Resolution A/RES/64/50 also provided that the fourth biennial meeting of States to consider the national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action should be held in New York from 14 to 18 June 2010, and that a conference to review progress made in implementation of the Programme of Action will be convened for a period of 2\u00a0weeks in New York, no later than in 2012.\n(7) Also on 2 December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/64/51 on Problems arising from the accumulation of conventional ammunition stockpiles in surplus, which encourages States in a position to do so to contribute to the development within the United Nations of technical guidelines for the stockpile management of conventional ammunition, in order to assist States in improving their national stockpile management capacity, preventing the growth of conventional ammunition surpluses,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a view to supporting the preparation of the Review Conference of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects to be held in 2012, the Union shall pursue the following objectives:\n\u2014 the promotion of the implementation of the UN Programme of Action on SALW both at global and regional level,\n\u2014 supporting the implementation of the International Tracing Instrument (ITI),\n\u2014 supporting the development and implementation of UN technical guidelines for ammunition stockpile management.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to achieve the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, the Union shall undertake the following measures:\n\u2014 developing the Programme of Action Implementation Support System as an effective tool to coordinate international efforts to implement the UN Programme of Action, including through support to the informal Group of Interested States on SALW,\n\u2014 organising up to eight 2-day regional meetings on advancing the implementation of the Programme of Action at regional level,\n\u2014 organising regional training-of-trainers courses on the International Tracing Instrument for countries in West Africa, and setting-up marking facilities and expertise in countries of the region lacking such equipment,\n\u2014 supporting the development of UN technical guidelines on ammunition stockpile management,\n\u2014 supporting the implementation of the guidelines through regional training-of-trainers programmes for law enforcement officials in the African Great Lakes region, Latin America and the Caribbean,\n\u2014 supporting individual States in critical need of assistance in the management of their ammunition stockpiles, by providing technical, legal and policy assistance and specialised training.\nA detailed description of these measures is set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the HR) shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The implementation of the measures referred to in Article 1(2) shall be carried out by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (hereinafter UNODA).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UNODA shall perform its task under the responsibility of the HR.

These meetings will aim at further familiarising relevant third countries with the regional aspects of the UN PoA and the recommendations of the Third and Fourth Biennial Meetings of States in preparation of the 2012 Review Conference. During the seminars beneficiary countries will, inter alia, take stock of existing regional implementation plans for the period 2010-2012 and will be encouraged to formulate regional implementation plans for the period 2013-2014 including measurable, achievable and time-bound targets.\nDevelopment and enhancement of the PoA-ISS as an effective tool to coordinate international efforts to implement the UN PoA, by integrating a web-based tool for matching SALW needs and resources into the PoA-ISS platform, by developing an electronic reporting function for the PoA national reports, by developing regional and thematic sections in the PoA-ISS, and by developing multilingual versions of the existing PoA-ISS platform. Support to the informal GIS as a forum to promote coordination, information and knowledge sharing between donors and the UN system as well as other stakeholders of the PoA about their small arms activities including on submitted project outlines and about policy making (see, e.g. the General Assembly Resolution on Practical Disarmament Measures, A/RES/63/62) will include support to the organisation and servicing of regular meetings of this Group (two to three times per year).\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results of the measure\nImproved regional implementation of the UN Programme of Action, effective preparation of beneficiary States for the Review Conference in 2012, and laying the groundwork for the development of realistic, achievable, measurable and time-bound regional implementation plans for the period 2012-2014.\nImproved, multilingual, user-friendly and reliable information on implementation needs related to the Programme of Action, making the Implementation Support System the primary tool to facilitate the implementation of the international instrument; rationalised management of international assistance through enhancement of the coordinating role of the Group of Interested States.\n2.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seminar venues\nUNODA will propose a list of potential venues for the regional seminars which will then be endorsed by the HR in consultation with the competent Council bodies.
