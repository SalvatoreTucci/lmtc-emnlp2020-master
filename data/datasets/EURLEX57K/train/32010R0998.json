The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 has been authorised for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 538/2007\u00a0(2), for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1521/2007\u00a0(3) and was provisionally authorised for 4 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005\u00a0(4).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of the preparation for chickens for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 27 May 2010\u00a0(5) that Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134, under the proposed conditions of use, does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has the potential to be efficacious, when fed to the target species, by improving zootechnical parameters. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 128, 16.5.2007, p. 16.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 335, 20.12.2007, p. 24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 84, 2.4.2005, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal (2010); 8(6):1636.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
