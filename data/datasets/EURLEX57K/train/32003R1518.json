In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that all exports for which export refunds are requested shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund. Therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the pigmeat sector which should in particular include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing licences for agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(6).\n(3) In order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the pigmeat sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down.\n(4) Article 13(11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences. Therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down.\n(5) In addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration. This period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending. It is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed.\n(6) In the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it. In this case, the licences shall not be subject to any special measures taken by the Commission.\n(7) In order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be laid down.\n(8) The Commission must dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system. In the interests of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["All exports of products in the pigmeat sector for which an export refund is requested, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund.", "1.

Applications for licences and licences shall bear, in section 15, the description of the product and, in section 16, the 12-digit product code of the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.\n3. The categories of products referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, as well as the rate of the security for export licences, are set out in Annex I.\n4.

Export licences are issued on the Wednesday following the period referred to in paragraph 1, provided that none of the particular measures referred to in paragraph 4 have since been taken by the Commission.\n4. Where applications for export licences concern quantities and/or expenditure which exceed the normal trade patterns, or where there is a risk that they will be exceeded, taking account of the limits referred to in Article 13(11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 and/or the corresponding expenditure during the period in question, the Commission may:\n(a) set a single percentage by which the quantities applied for are accepted;\n(b) refuse the applications for which export licences have not yet been awarded;\n(c) suspend the lodging of applications for export licences for a maximum of five working days. A suspension for a longer period may be decided in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75. In these cases, applications for export licences lodged during the suspension period shall be inadmissible.\nThese measures may be adjusted according to the category of products and the destination.\n5. Where quantities applied for are rejected or reduced, the security shall be released immediately for all quantities for which an application was not satisfied.\n6. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, where a single percentage of acceptance less than 80 % is set, the licence shall be issued at the latest by the 11th working day following publication of that percentage in the Official Journal of the European Union. During the 10 working days following its publication, the operator may:\n(a) either withdraw his application, in which case the security is released immediately; or\n(b) request immediate issuing of the licence, in which case the competent authority shall issue it without delay but no sooner than the normal issue date for the relevant week.\n7.
