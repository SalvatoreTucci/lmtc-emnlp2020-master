It is therefore necessary to allocate such fishing opportunities for 2004 to the Member States which acceded in 2004 taking into account fishing patterns similar to those used in 2002, in order to allow the fishermen of these Member States to continue their activities.\n(2) The allocation of fishing opportunities should not lead to the result that catches legally taken before 1 May 2004 are liable to quota deductions under Article 23(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy\u00a0(3), Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year to year management of TACs and quotas\u00a0(4) or Article 26 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(5).\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep sea stocks\u00a0(6) lays down power and capacity ceilings on the fishing fleet that may land significant quantities of deep sea species, and determines a reference period for establishing those ceilings, namely the three years prior to its entry into force. It is necessary that the reference period for establishing those ceilings take into account the recent years in order to allow the fishermen of the Member States which acceded in 2004 to continue their activities.\n(4) With a view to allow the application of Regulations (EC) Nos 2340/2002 and 2347/2002 to the Member States which acceded in 2004 as from the date of Accession, it is imperative that this Regulation enters into force on 1 May 2004.\n(5) Regulations (EC) Nos 2340/2002 and 2347/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2340/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n2. the following Article 4a shall be inserted:\n3.
