It is therefore appropriate to amend the existing provisions, based on the conclusions of the scientific opinion and available monitoring data.\n(5) On a request from the Commission, EFSA adopted an opinion relating to endosulfan on 20 June 2005\u00a0(3).\n(6) Based on the conclusions of the scientific opinion and available monitoring data, it is appropriate to amend the maximum level for endosulfan in crude vegetable oil in order to take into account to a certain extent the concentration of endosulfan in the crude vegetable oil compared to the level in the oilseed.\n(7) On a request from the Commission, EFSA adopted an opinion relating to hexachlorocyclohexanes (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 HCH) on 4 July 2005\u00a0(4) and an opinion on endrin on 9 November 2005\u00a0(5).\n(8) Based on the conclusions of the scientific opinions and available monitoring data, no modifications to the existing maximum levels as regards hexachlorocyclohexanes and endrin are necessary.\n(9) As regards aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane, DDT, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH), the term \u2018fats\u2019 should be replaced by the terms \u2018fats and oils\u2019 to indicate clearly that all fats and oils, including animal fat, vegetable oils, fish oil, are covered.\n(10) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive 12 months after the entry into force at the latest.
