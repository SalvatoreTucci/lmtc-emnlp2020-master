On 14 June 2007 a protection zone was established around an outbreak in the municipality of Offanengo, Province of Cremona. The protection zones are partially overlapping.\n(2) Accordingly, the movement and transport of pigs on public and private roads within those protection zones have been prohibited.\n(3) However, Italy has submitted two requests for an exemption from that prohibition for the transport of pigs for slaughter coming from outside those protection zones, on public and private roads within the protection zones, in order to transport them to slaughterhouses situated in the protection zones.\n(4) It is appropriate to provide for those two exemptions, subject to the condition that Italy takes strict control and precaution measures that guarantee that there is no risk of the spread of the disease.\n(5) Commission Decision 2007/123/EC of 20 February 2007 was adopted to grant a similar exemption for a slaughterhouse in the protection zone around an outbreak of swine vesicular disease in the municipality of Romano di Lombardia, Province of Bergamo, Italy.
