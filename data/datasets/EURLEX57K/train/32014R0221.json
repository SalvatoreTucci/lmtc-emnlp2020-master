Furthermore, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 fixes the maximum co-financing rates and a minimum amount of that aid per Member State.\n(2) The Commission should fix the indicative allocation of the aid for the school fruit and vegetables scheme to each Member State on the basis of criteria referred to in Article 23(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The Commission should furthermore periodically assess whether the indicative allocation remains consistent with those criteria.\n(3) Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 288/2009\u00a0(3) sets the amount of the indicative allocation of Union aid per Member State based on the overall Union budget of EUR 90 million. Since Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 increases the overall budget for the school fruit and vegetables scheme to EUR 150 million and it fixes new co-financing rates, a new indicative allocation should be fixed.\n(4) The new indicative allocation should also take into account the criteria referred to in Article 23(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 based on the latest available data from 2012 as regards the number of children in the age group of six- to ten-year olds as a proportion of the population in Member State's regions.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly. To take into account the periodicity of the school year, the new indicative allocation should therefore become applicable as from 1 August 2014.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 288/2009\nAnnex II is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "Entry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 346, 20.12.2013, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common market organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 of 7 April 2009 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards Community aid for supplying fruit and vegetables, processed fruit and vegetables and banana products to children in educational establishments, in the framework of a School Fruit Scheme (OJ L 94, 8.4.2009, p. 38).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX II\nIndicative allocation of Union aid per Member State\nMember State Co-financing rate (in %) Children 6-10 abs. numbers EUR\nAustria 75\u00a0% 406\u00a0322 2\u00a0239\u00a0273\nBelgium 75\u00a0% 611\u00a0450 3\u00a0369\u00a0750\nBulgaria 90\u00a0% 316\u00a0744 2\u00a0094\u00a0722\nCroatia 90\u00a0% 205\u00a0774 1\u00a0360\u00a0845\nCyprus 75\u00a0% 44\u00a0823 290\u00a0000\nCzech Republic 88\u00a0% 480\u00a0495 3\u00a0124\u00a0660\nDenmark 75\u00a0% 328\u00a0182 1\u00a0808\u00a0638\nEstonia 90\u00a0% 66\u00a0436 439\u00a0361\nFinland 75\u00a0% 290\u00a0308 1\u00a0599\u00a0911\nFrance 76\u00a0% 4\u00a0051\u00a0279 22\u00a0500\u00a0145\nGermany 75\u00a0% 3\u00a0575\u00a0991 19\u00a0707\u00a0575\nGreece 81\u00a0% 529\u00a0648 3\u00a0143\u00a0600\nHungary 86\u00a0% 482\u00a0160 3\u00a0031\u00a0022\nIreland 75\u00a0% 319\u00a0126 1\u00a0758\u00a0729\nItaly 80\u00a0% 2\u00a0853\u00a0098 16\u00a0719\u00a0794\nLatvia 90\u00a0% 95\u00a0861 633\u00a0957\nLithuania 90\u00a0% 136\u00a0285 901\u00a0293\nLuxembourg 75\u00a0% 29\u00a0473 290\u00a0000\nMalta 75\u00a0% 19\u00a0511 290\u00a0000\nNetherlands 75\u00a0% 986\u00a0118 5\u00a0434\u00a0576\nPoland 88\u00a0% 1\u00a0802\u00a0733 11\u00a0645\u00a0350\nPortugal 85\u00a0% 527\u00a0379 3\u00a0284\u00a0967\nRomania 89\u00a0% 1\u00a0054\u00a0185 6\u00a0869\u00a0985\nSlovakia 89\u00a0% 262\u00a0703 1\u00a0709\u00a0502\nSlovenia 83\u00a0% 91\u00a0095 554\u00a0291\nSpain 75\u00a0% 2\u00a0337\u00a0457 12\u00a0939\u00a0604\nSweden 75\u00a0% 518\u00a0322 2\u00a0856\u00a0514\nUnited Kingdom 76\u00a0% 3\u00a0494\u00a0635 19\u00a0401\u00a0935\nEU 28 79\u00a0% 25\u00a0917\u00a0593 150\u00a0000\u00a0000\u2019"}
