That Article also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Community trade.\n(2) In addition, Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC provides that where a Member State considers that its territory or part thereof is free from one of the diseases listed in Annex E(II) to that Directive, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission. That Article also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Community trade.\n(3) Commission Decision 2004/558/EC of 15 July 2004 implementing Council Directive 64/432/EEC as regards additional guarantees for intra-Community trade in bovine animals relating to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and the approval of the eradication programmes presented by certain Member States\u00a0(2) approves the programmes for the control and eradication of the infection with the bovine herpesvirus type 1 (\u2018BHV1\u2019) presented by the Member States listed in Annex I to that Decision for the regions listed in that Annex, and for which additional guarantees for BHV1 apply in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC.\n(4) In addition, Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC lists the regions of the Member States that are considered free of BHV1 infection and for which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC. Annex III to Decision 2004/558/EC defines BHV1-free holdings.\n(5) At present, all regions of Germany are listed in Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC. Germany has now submitted documentation in support of its application to declare a part of its territory free of BHV1 infection and provided rules for the national movement of bovine animals within and into this part of its territory. Accordingly, Germany has requested the application of the additional guaranties, in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC, for the administrative units of Regierungsbezirke Oberpfalz and Oberfranken in the federal state of Bavaria.\n(6) Following the evaluation of the application submitted by Germany, it is appropriate that those two BHV1-free administrative units in Germany be listed in Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC and to extend the application of the additional guaranties established in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC to them. Annexes I and II to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Italy has submitted the programmes for eradicating BHV1 infection in the Autonomous Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia and in the Autonomous Province of Trento. Those programmes comply with the criteria set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. Those programmes also provide for rules for the national movement of bovine animals within and into those regions which are equivalent to those previously implemented in the Province of Bolzano in Italy, which were successful in eradicating the disease in that Province.\n(8) The programmes presented by Italy for those two Regions, and the additional guarantees presented in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC, should be approved. Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The European Food Safety Authority has delivered an opinion on the \u2018Definition of a BoHV-1-free animal and a BoHV-1-free holding, and the procedures to verify and maintain this status\u2019\u00a0(3). It is appropriate to take into account certain recommendations of that opinion. Annex III to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Annexes I, II and III to Decision 2004/558/EC should be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Decision 2004/558/EC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 August 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 1977.
