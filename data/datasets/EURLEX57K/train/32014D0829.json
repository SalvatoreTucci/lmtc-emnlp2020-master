It was agreed that the process leading to this comprehensive solution would include, as a first step, initial mutually-agreed measures to be taken by both sides for a duration of six\u00a0months and renewable by mutual consent.\n(3) As part of this first step, Iran would undertake a number of voluntary measures as specified in the Joint Plan of Action. In return, a number of voluntary measures would be undertaken which would include, for the Union, the suspension of restrictive measures concerning the prohibition on the provision of insurance and reinsurance and transport for Iranian crude oil, the prohibition on the import, purchase or transport of Iranian petrochemical products and on the provision of related services, and the prohibition on trade in gold and precious metals with the Government of Iran, its public bodies and the Central Bank of Iran, or persons and entities acting on their behalf. The suspension of those restrictive measures would last for a duration of six months during which the relevant contracts would have to be executed.\n(4) Furthermore, the Joint Plan of Action also foresees a tenfold increase of the authorisation thresholds in relation to the transfers of funds to and from Iran.\n(5) On 20 January 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/21/CFSP\u00a0(2) amending Decision\u00a02010/413/CFSP in order to implement the provisions concerning the Union restrictive measures contained in the Joint Plan of Action.\n(6) On 19 July 2014, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, supported by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, agreed with Iran to extend the implementation of the measures of the Joint Plan of Action until 24 November 2014.\n(7) On 21 July 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/480/CFSP\u00a0(3) amending Decision\u00a02010/413/CFSP in order to extend the provisions concerning the Union restrictive measures contained in the Joint Plan of Action.\n(8) On 24 November 2014, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United\u00a0Kingdom and the United States, supported by the EU coordinator and negotiator for the E3/EU+3 group in the Iran nuclear negotiations, agreed with Iran to extend the implementation of the measures of the Joint Plan of Action until 30 June 2015.\n(9) The suspension of the Union restrictive measures specified in the Joint Plan of Action should therefore be extended until 30 June 2015. Relevant contracts would have to be executed within that date.\n(10) Decision 2010/413/CFSP should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article 26a of Decision 2010/413/CFSP is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 26a\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition set out in Article 3a(1) shall be suspended until 30 June 2015 insofar as it concerns the transport of Iranian crude oil.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition set out in Article 3a(2) shall be suspended until 30 June 2015 insofar as it concerns the provision of insurance and reinsurance, related to the import, purchase, or transport of Iranian crude oil.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition set out in Article 3b shall be suspended until 30 June 2015.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition set out in Article 4c shall be suspended until 30 June 2015 insofar as it concerns gold and precious metals.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 10(3)(a), (b) and (c) are replaced by the following points until 30 June 2015:\n\u201c(a) transfers due on transactions regarding foodstuffs, healthcare, medical equipment, or for agricultural or humanitarian purposes below EUR 1\u00a0000\u00a0000, as well as transfers regarding personal remittances, below EUR 400\u00a0000, shall be carried out without any prior authorisation.
