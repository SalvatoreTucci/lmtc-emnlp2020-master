It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of that information, subsequent discussions with the authorities of the Republic of Korea and an on-the-spot examination of the rules of production and the control measures applied in the Republic of Korea have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of organic production of processed agricultural products for use as food are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Consequently, the Republic of Korea should be included in the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 for processed agricultural products for use as food (Category D products).\n(3) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 contains a list of control bodies and control authorities competent to carry out controls and issue certificates in third countries for the purpose of equivalence. As a consequence of the inclusion of the Republic of Korea in Annex III to that Regulation, the relevant control bodies and control authorities recognised until now for the import of Category D products from the Republic of Korea should be deleted from Annex IV.\n(4) Annexes III and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The inclusion of the Republic of Korea in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should apply from 1\u00a0February 2015. In order to allow operators to adapt to the amendments made to Annexes III and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008, the amendment of the latter Annex should, however, apply only after a reasonable time period.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) Annex III is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation;\n(2) Annex IV is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nPoint (1) of Article 1 shall apply from 1 February 2015.\nPoint (2) of Article 1 shall apply from 1 May 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0189, 20.7.2007, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 of 8 December 2008 laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries (OJ L\u00a0334, 12.12.2008, p.\u00a025).\nANNEX I\nIn Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008, the following text is inserted:\n\u2018REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nProduct categories\n:\nCategory of products Designation of category as in Annex IV Limitations\nProcessed agricultural products for use as food D\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOrigin\n: organically grown ingredients in products of category D that have been grown in the Republic of Korea or that have been imported into the Republic of Korea:\n\u2014 either from the Union\n\u2014 or from a third country for which the Republic of Korea has recognised that the products have been produced and controlled in that third country in accordance with the rules equivalent to those laid down in the legislation of the Republic of Korea.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nProduction standards\n: Act on Promotion of Environmentally-friendly Agriculture and Fisheries and Management and Support for Organic Food.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCompetent authorities\n: Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nControl bodies\n:\nCode number Name Internet address\nKR-ORG-001 Korea Agricultural Product and Food Certification www.kafc.kr\nKR-ORG-002 Doalnara Organic Certificated Korea www.doalnara.or.kr\nKR-ORG-003 Bookang tech www.bkt21.co.kr\nKR-ORG-004 Global Organic Agriculturalist Association www.goaa.co.kr\nKR-ORG-005 OCK\nKR-ORG-006 Konkuk University industrial cooperation corps http://eco.konkuk.ac.kr\nKR-ORG-007 Korea Environment-Friendly Organic Certification Centre www.a-cert.co.kr\nKR-ORG-008 Konkuk Ecocert Certification Service www.ecocert.co.kr\nKR-ORG-009 Woorinong Certification www.woric.co.kr\nKR-ORG-010 ACO (Australian Certified Organic) www.aco.net.au\nKR-ORG-011 BCS (BCS Oko-Garantie GmbH) www.bcs-oeko.com\nKR-ORG-012 BCS Korea www.bcskorea.com\nKR-ORG-014 The Centrefor Environment Friendly Agricultural Products Certification www.hgreent.or.kr\nKR-ORG-015 ECO-Leaders Certification Co., Ltd www.ecoleaders.kr\nKR-ORG-016 Ecocert www.ecocert.com\nKR-ORG-017 Jeonnam bioindustry foundation www.jbio.org/oc/oc01.asp\nKR-ORG-018 Controlunion http://certification.controlunion.com\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCertificate issuing bodies and authorities\n: as at point 5.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDuration of the inclusion\n: 31 January 2018.\u2019\nANNEX II\nAnnex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1) In the entry relating to \u2018Australian Certified Organic\u2019, in point 3, the row concerning third country \u2018South Korea\u2019 and code number \u2018KR-BIO-107\u2019 is deleted.\n(2) In the entry relating to \u2018BCS \u00d6ko-Garantie GmbH\u2019, in point 3, in the row concerning third country \u2018South Korea\u2019 and code number \u2018KR-BIO-141\u2019, the cross in column D is deleted;
