In that case, the salt is intended to penetrate the fish meat to give it a long shelf life.\n(4) Cod fillets that have been only lightly salted (usually of a total salt content by weight of around 2 % but in any case less than 12 %) present different objective characteristics in so far as the actual and lasting preservation depends essentially upon an additional external process, such as freezing.\n(5) In order to ensure a consistent application of the Combined Nomenclature, the classification of frozen and salted cod fillets under subheadings 0304\u00a071\u00a010 and 0304\u00a071\u00a090 or subheadings 0305\u00a032\u00a011 and 0305\u00a032\u00a019 should therefore depend on the process which ensures the actual preservation of the product. This is consistent with the case law of the Court of Justice which used the same criterion for the classification of slightly dried and slightly smoked meat\u00a0(2).\n(6) Cod that has been only lightly salted should therefore be classified under subheadings 0304\u00a071\u00a010 and 0304\u00a071\u00a090 in so far as freezing is necessary to avoid degeneration of the product. Where, on the contrary, if it is the salt that ensures the preservation of the product, the cod fillets should be classified under subheadings 0305\u00a032\u00a011 and 0305\u00a032\u00a019.\n(7) An Additional note should therefore be inserted in Chapter 3 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature to ensure its uniform interpretation throughout the Union.\n(8) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["In Chapter 3 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 the following Additional note 1 is inserted:\n\u20181.
