That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of the substance monensin sodium (Coxidin) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening and turkeys, to be classified in the additive category \u2018occidiostats and histomonostats\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 20 October 2005 that monensin sodium (Coxidin) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment\u00a0(2). The Authority further concluded that monensin sodium (Coxidin) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that product may be effectively used to prevent coccidiosis. This opinion also verified the report on the method of analysis of that feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. The Authority concluded that it was necessary to establish maximum residue limits (MRLs). However, it was unable to propose MRLs since the applicant had not provided the data required. After receiving those data the Authority adopted an opinion proposing provisional MRLs on 21 November 2006\u00a0(3). It may be necessary to review the MRLs set out in the Annex to this Regulation in the light of the results of a future evaluation of the active substance concerned by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The substance, specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018coccidiostats and histomonostats\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
