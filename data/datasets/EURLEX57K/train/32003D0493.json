Those limits have been frequently and largely exceeded in samples of Brazil nuts.\n(4) Such contamination constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community and it is therefore appropriate to adopt protective measures at Community level.\n(5) The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (\u2018FVO\u2019) carried out a mission in Brazil from 25 January to 9 February 2003 to assess the control systems in place to prevent aflatoxin contamination levels in Brazil nuts intended for export to the Community. The mission revealed, inter alia, that:\n\u2014 the national legislation provides for an inadequate sampling procedure,\n\u2014 no adequate traceability system is in place in relation to Brazil nuts, either during the process chain, or in relation to the export procedure and certification,\n\u2014 control over the sample during the dispatch to the laboratory is inadequate,\n\u2014 some laboratories entitled to perform analysis for the purposes of export certification do not produce accurate or dependable results,\n\u2014 on some aflatoxin certificates issued by private laboratories lot identification is often inadequate to enable dependable guarantees on the relationship between sample, lot and certificate,\n\u2014 the official controls on returned lots is inadequate.\n(6) It is necessary that Brazil nuts be collected, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygiene practices. It is also necessary to establish the levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin in samples taken from consignment immediately prior to their dispatch from Brazil. The sampling and the analysis should be performed in accordance with Commission Directive 98/53/EC of 16 July 1998 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(4), as amended by Directive 2002/27/EC of 13 March 2002\u00a0(5).\n(7) Brazil should provide documentary evidence to accompany each consignment of Brazil nuts, relating to the conditions of collection, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport, as well as the results of laboratory analysis of the samples taken from consignment for levels of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin.\n(8) From the findings of the FVO's mission, it may be concluded that Brazil cannot ensure currently dependable analytical results or guarantee lot integrity in respect of certification of consignments of Brazil nuts. Therefore, any certificate issued for Brazil nuts from Brazil raises serious doubts with regard to its reliability. Furthermore, it may also be concluded that current official controls on returned lots are inadequate. It is therefore appropriate to impose strict conditions on the return of non-conforming lots. In the event that those strict conditions are not complied with, subsequent non-conforming lots should be destroyed.\n(9) It is therefore necessary in order to safeguard public health that all lots of Brazil nuts imported into the Community, are subjected to sampling and analysis for their aflatoxin level by the competent authority of the importing Member State prior to release onto the market.\n(10) In the interests of public health, Member States should provide the Commission with periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of Brazil nuts. Such reports should be in addition to the notification obligations under the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed established under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Restrictions on imports of Brazil nuts in shell originating in or consigned from Brazil\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may not import Brazil nuts in shell falling within category CN code 0801\u00a021\u00a000 originating in or consigned from Brazil (\u2018Brazil nuts\u2019), unless the consignment is accompanied by:\n(a) a report containing the results of official sampling and analysis; and\n(b) a health certificate issued in accordance with the model set out in Annex 1 and completed, signed and verified by a representative of the competent authority of Brazil, the Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, Pecu\u00e1ria e Abastecimento \u2014 (MAPA).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States shall authorise the import of consignments of Brazil nuts not complying with paragraph 1(a) and (b), which left Brazil before 5 July 2003, provided that the operator can demonstrate by sampling and analysis, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 98/53/EC, that the consignments comply with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 as regards maximum permitted levels for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin.", "Sampling and analysis of Brazil nuts by the competent authority of Brazil\nThe sampling and the analysis of Brazil nuts as provided for in Article 1(1)(a) must be performed in accordance with the provisions of Commission Directive 98/53/EC.\nThe analysis must be performed by the official control laboratory for the analysis of aflatoxins in Brazil nuts in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the Laborat\u00f3rio de Controle de Qualidade de Seguran\u00e7a Alimentar \u2014 (LACQSA).", "Code and points of entry into the Community for consignments of Brazil nuts\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each consignment of Brazil nuts shall be identified with a code, which corresponds to the code on the report and health certificate as provided for in Article 1(1)(a) and (b).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consignments of Brazil nuts may only be imported into the Community through one of the points of entry listed in Annex 2.", "Obligations on Member States as regards imports of Brazil nuts from Brazil\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities in each Member State shall ensure that Brazil nuts are subject to documentary checks to ensure that the requirements of Article 1(1) are complied with.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authorities in each Member State shall undertake sampling and analysis of each consignment of Brazil nuts for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin before release onto the market from the point of entry into the Community.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall submit to the Commission every three months a report of all analytical results of official controls on consignments of Brazil nuts, as provided for in paragraph 2.
