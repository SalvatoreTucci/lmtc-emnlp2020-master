Protocol No 2 was amended by the Adaptation Protocol(2) adjusting trade aspects of the Europe Agreement. It was improved by Decision No 6/2001 of the EC-Estonia Association Council(3).\n(2) A trade agreement has recently been concluded which amends the Adaptation Protocol. It aims to improve economic convergence in preparation for accession and should enter into force not later than 1 July 2003. On the Community side this agreement lays down concessions in the form of completed liberalisation of trade for certain processed agricultural products and duty-free quotas for others. For imports outside of these quotas the current provisions continue to apply.\n(3) The procedure for adopting a decision to amend the Adaptation Protocol will not be completed in time for it to enter into force on 1 July 2003. It is therefore necessary to provide for the application of the concessions made to Estonia on an autonomous basis from 1 July 2003.\n(4) On processed agricultural products covered by Protocol No 2, but not listed in the present Regulation, the trade provisions laid down by Protocol No 2 should apply.\n(5) For the importation of certain goods no duties should be applied; those goods should not be eligible for export refunds.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4) provides for a system for managing tariff quotas.
