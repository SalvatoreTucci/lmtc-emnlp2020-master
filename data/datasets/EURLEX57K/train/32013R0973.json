The need for the amendment has arisen as a result of the new rules relating to the labelling of the ingredients of foodstuffs (Quantitative Ingredient Declaration \u2013 QUID) introduced by Commission Directive 2001/101/EC of 26 November 2001 amending the Labelling Directive, Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Annex I to the Labelling Directive now stipulates that an ingredient may be described as \u2018\u2026-meat\u2019 only if it does not exceed a specified fat and connective tissue content. For pigmeat, fat content may not exceed 30\u00a0% and connective tissue content 25\u00a0%. An ingredient which exceeds this limit value must be described as \u2018fatty meat\u2019 for example.\n2. \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 are traditionally produced with belly, belly fat, jowl, jowl fat, back or back fat according to the recipe that has been handed down. These ingredients are largely responsible for the consistency and smoothness of the sausages. Without these ingredients, the minced meat product would dry out considerably during frying and fall apart. The fatty meat is also largely responsible for the flavour, which is enhanced by the spicy nuances provided by the specific spices characteristic of \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019.\nANNEX II\nConsolidated single document\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(1)\n\u2018N\u00dcRNBERGER BRATW\u00dcRSTE\u2019/\u2018N\u00dcRNBERGER ROSTBRATW\u00dcRSTE\u2019\nEC No: DE-PGI-0105-0184-28.09.2010\nPGI ( X ) PDO ( )\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State or Third Country\nGermany\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product\nClass 1.2.

The typical reduction of the length and weight of \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 can be traced back to at least 1573. Nuremberg\u2019s location at the intersection of two important trade routes meant that oriental spices were available in Nuremberg for making sausages from an early time.\nThe current tradition of Bratwurst production in Nuremberg has an illustrious past. \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 were greatly appreciated by Goethe and Jean Paul, for example. The Bratwurst-Gl\u00f6cklein in the St. Sebald area was one of the most famous public houses in 19th century Germany; not only was it open to aristocrats and plutocrats, but it was also an essential stop for every visitor to the city.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 are characterised by their unusual small shape and marjoram notes. They conform to a high-quality standard which has long been controlled, are known well beyond the Nuremberg region and are highly regarded by consumers.\nThis is reflected in the fact that the standard programme of a city visit today includes eating \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 in one of the many \u2018Bratwurstk\u00fcchen\u2019 or \u2018Wurstbratereien\u2019 in Nuremberg\u2019s city centre.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe centuries-old tradition of Bratwurst production in Nuremberg, the high quality standard which has long been controlled and the unusual small shape have made \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019/\u2018N\u00fcrnberger Rostbratw\u00fcrste\u2019 known and highly appreciated throughout Germany and the world.\nThe speciality emerged in the former Imperial City of Nuremburg as a result of its geographical location as a key intersection on the trade and spice routes from East Asia, introducing spices such as marjoram, nutmeg and pepper. It was the availability of these spices from Asia that made production possible in the first place. As Nuremburg was a city involved in much long-distance trade and with a number of refined modern traditions, ever smaller, more refined, better spiced sausages were produced here, which in time became the famous \u2018N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\u2019.\nUnlike the country areas, the city placed greater emphasis on quality from the outset. While quantity took precedence elsewhere, the principle on which production in Nuremburg was based was quality over quantity, and it was this which resulted in the small size of the sausages.\nCompliance with the recipe and quality date back to the supervisory rules of the Nuremburg city council. Nuremburg may well lay claim to the oldest foodstuffs supervision scheme, which is mentioned in the penal code dating from the year 1300.\nBy publishing the recipe, exercising strict supervision and restricting production to the city area, the city of Nuremberg has helped to ensure that the character of the sausage is an indication of its origin.\nThe link with the geographical area was therefore based initially on the geographical location as a key intersection on spice and trade routes and on the early introduction of supervision of foodstuffs. The geographical location and foodstuffs supervision and the associated protection of the recipe therefore resulted in the particular quality of the sausages. The imperial city with its extensive trade network across the world resulted a speciality which was very well known from the Middle Ages onwards. Today the link is based on the renown enjoyed by this speciality which is traditionally appreciated worldwide.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nMarkenblatt Vol. 44 of 2.11.2007, Part 7a-bb, p. 20269\nhttps://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/geo/detail.pdfdownload/142\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
