Veal calves which were ready for slaughter had to be kept in the stables awaiting the end of the movement restrictions. In order to avoid a further deterioration of the veal market when those heavier animals are coming forward for slaughter it is appropriate to provide for a private storage scheme which is likely to absorb the supplementary tonnage being produced until October where the balance is expected to return to the market.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) 907/2000(4) lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards aid for private storage in the beef and veal sector. Provision should hereby be made to fix not only the amount of aid for a specific minimum period of storage but also the amounts to be applied if that period is extended. In the light of the urgency of this measure, the amount of aid shall be fixed in advance. The fixing of the amount of aid should in particular take into account the market value of the veal carcasses and their subsequent depreciation through freezing.\n(3) With a view to increasing the market effect of the private storage arrangements, the period for placing in storage should be as short as possible.\n(4) Article 3(2)(a) and Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 907/2000 should not apply due to the age and weight of the veal animals concerned.\n(5) The measures provided for in Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural productions(5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83(6), should not apply in order to ensure equal treatment of all products regardless of their destination.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
