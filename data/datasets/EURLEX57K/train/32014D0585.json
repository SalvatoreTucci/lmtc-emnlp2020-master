The interoperable EU-wide eCall service is also expected to bring savings to society by improving incident management and by reducing road congestion and secondary accidents.\n(6) In order to ensure the full functionality, compatibility, interoperability, continuity and conformity of the service throughout the Union, and to reduce the costs of implementation for the Union as a whole, all Member States should deploy the eCall priority action in accordance with the common specifications established in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013. That should be without prejudice to the right of each Member State to deploy additional technical means to handle other emergency calls.\n(7) Member States should ensure that data transmitted via the EU-wide eCall service are used exclusively to attain the objectives of this Decision.\n(8) As experience with other emergency calls systems has demonstrated, manually triggered eCalls may include a share of assistance calls. If necessary, Member States should be able to implement all appropriate technical and organisational means in order to filter those assistance calls so as to ensure that only real emergency calls are handled by eCall PSAPs.\n(9) Since not all Union citizens are familiar with the use of the EU-wide eCall service, its deployment should be preceded by an awareness-raising campaign supported by the Commission, explaining to citizens the benefits, functionalities and data protection safeguards of the new system. The campaign should take place in Member States and should aim at informing users on how to use the system properly and how to avoid false alarms.\n(10) In line with the recommendations made by the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (the \u2018Article 29 Data Protection Working Party\u2019) in its Working document on data protection and privacy implications in eCall initiative, adopted on 26 September 2006, when deploying the eCall PSAP infrastructure, Member States are to ensure that the processing of personal data in the context of handling eCalls fully complies with the personal data protection rules provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) and in Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6).\n(11) Since eCalls are emergency calls, as defined in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013, the handling of those calls should be provided free of charge to users of the EU-wide eCall service.\n(12) Depending on the organisation of the handling of emergency calls in each Member State, such calls can be first received under the responsibility of a public authority or a private organisation recognised by the Member State concerned. In particular, eCalls can be dealt with in a different way depending on the type of eCall activation (manual or automatic).\n(13) In accordance with national procedures determined by the national authority concerned, data can be transferred to service partners, defined as public or private organisations recognised by national authorities that play a role in the handling of incidents related to eCalls (including road operators and assistance services), which should be subject to the same privacy and data protection rules as are applicable to the eCall PSAPs.\n(14) Since the objectives of this Decision, namely to ensure the coordinated and coherent deployment of the interoperable EU-wide eCall service and to guarantee the full functionality, compatibility, interoperability, continuity and conformity of the service throughout Europe, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and/or the private sector but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall deploy on their territory, at least six months before the date of application of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the type-approval requirements for the deployment of the eCall in-vehicle system and amending Directive 2007/46/EC and in any case no later than 1 October 2017, the eCall PSAP infrastructure required for the proper receipt and handling of all eCalls, if necessary purged of non-emergency calls, in accordance with the specifications laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013, in order to ensure the full functionality, compatibility, interoperability, continuity and conformity of the interoperable EU-wide eCall service.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 1 is without prejudice to the right of each Member State to organise its emergency services in a way which is most cost-effective and most appropriate to its needs, including the ability to reject calls that are not emergency calls and might not be handled by eCall PSAPs, in particular in the case of manually triggered eCalls.\nThis paragraph and paragraph 1 are without prejudice to the right of each Member State to allow private organisations recognised by it to deal with the receipt and handling of some or all eCalls, in accordance with the specifications laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 305/2013.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that data transmitted via the eCall service are used exclusively for the attainment of the objectives of this Decision.", "Member States shall ensure that the handling of eCalls is provided free of charge to users of the EU-wide eCall service.", "By 24 December 2015, Member States shall report to the Commission on the state of implementation of this Decision.
