The contracts and agreements referred to in paragraph 1 may, in the case of beet with a sucrose content below 14.5 %, define beet suitable for processing into sugar, if such contracts and agreements provide for further reductions for sucrose contents below 14.5 % but above the minimum sucrose content specified in that definition.\n3. If the definition referred to in paragraph 2 is not included in the contracts and agreements, the Member State concerned may lay down that definition.
