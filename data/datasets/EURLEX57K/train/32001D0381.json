UNDERTAKING\n(4) The sole exporting producer in Russia and its related companies involved in the production, trade and importation into the Community of the product concerned offered an undertaking. According to this undertaking, these companies have offered to sell the product concerned to their unrelated customers in the Community at a minimum price.\n(5) The Commission considers that the undertaking offered by the Russian company, Joint Stock Company \"United Company Siberian Aluminium\", Studencheskaya Street, 33/4, Moscow, Russia, and its related companies, namely the production company Sayan Foil, Sayanagorsk, Russia, the export sales company Rual Trade Limited, Suites 7B &  8B, 50 Town Range, Gibraltar and the importing company Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH, Graf-Adolf-Platz 1-2, D-40213, D\u0102\u017asseldorf, can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover, the regular and detailed reports which these companies undertook to provide to the Commission and the structure of their sales of the product concerned will allow effective monitoring such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking will be limited.\n(6) In order to ensure the effective respect and monitoring of the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty should be conditional upon presentation of a commercial invoice containing the information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 which is necessary for customs to ascertain that shipments correspond to the commercial documents at the required level of detail. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product concerned presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty should instead be payable.\n(7) In the event of a suspected breach, breach or withdrawal of the undertaking an anti-dumping duty may be imposed, pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation,", "main_body": ["The undertaking offered by Joint Stock Company \"United Company Siberian Aluminium\", Studencheskaya Street, 33/4, Moscow, Russia, Sayan Foil, Sayanagorsk, Russia, Rual Trade Limited, Suites 7B &  8B, 50 Town Range, Gibraltar, and Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH, Graf-Adolf-Platz 1-2, D-40213, D\u0102\u017asseldorf, in the framework of the anti-dumping proceedings concerning imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the PRC and Russia is hereby accepted.", "This Decision shall enter into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Decision shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nPascal Lamy\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 257, 11.10.2000, p. 2.\n(3) OJ C 45, 18.2.2000, p. 2.\n(4) See page 1 of this Official Journal."}
