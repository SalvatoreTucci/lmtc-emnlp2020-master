Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) The preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007\u00a0(3). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT\u00a04529 as a feed additive for laying hens and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use in water for drinking, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 1 July 2014\u00a0(4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority further concluded that the use of the preparation has the potential to increase laying intensity and improve the feed-to-egg mass ratio. It considered that the results are independent of the mode of administration provided that the exposure in water for drinking is the same by an equivalent dose to feed. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007\nRegulation (EC) No 1520/2007 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 4 is deleted.\n(2) Annex IV is deleted.", "Transitional measures\nThe preparation specified in the Annex and feed containing that preparation, which are produced and labelled before 3\u00a0September 2015 in accordance with the rules applicable before 3\u00a0March 2015 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 January 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feeding-stuffs (OJ L\u00a0270, 14.12.1970, p.\u00a01).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007 of 19 December 2007 concerning the permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs (OJ L\u00a0335, 20.12.2007, p.\u00a017).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2014; 12(7):3789.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nCFU/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 % CFU/l of water for drinking\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
