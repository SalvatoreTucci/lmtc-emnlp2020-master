The initial budgetary commitment shall be based on an indicative financial plan; this commitment shall be made for one year.\n4. The commitment will be made when the decision approving assistance is adopted by the Standing Committee on Plant Health under the procedure mentioned in Article 16a of Council Directive 77/93/EEC (1).\n5. Following commitment a first advance of not more than 40 % of the amount committed may be made.\n6. The balance of the amount committed is paid as two equal payments, each of 20 % of the total amount committed. The first part of the balance is paid upon presentation to the Commission of an interim report of activity. The second and final part of  the balance is paid upon presentation to the Commission and subject to its approval of the detailed total expenditure made and of the final report.\nAuthorities responsible for the implementation of the programme\n- Central administration:\nInstituto de Protec\u00e7ao da Produ\u00e7ao\nAgro-Alimentar (IPPAA)\nCentro Nacional de Protec\u00e7ao da Produ\u00e7ao Agr\u00edcola (CNPPA)\nQuinta do Marqu\u00eas\nP-2780 Oeiras\n- Local administration:\nRegiao Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores\nSecretaria Regional da Agricultura e Pescas\nDirec\u00e7ao Regional do Desenvolvimento Agr\u00e1rio\nVinha Brava\nP-9700 Angra do Hero\u00edsma, Ilha Terceira\n7.
