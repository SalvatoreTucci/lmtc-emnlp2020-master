However, a report of a pest-risk assessment based on the limited scientific information available has demonstrated that this specified organism causes severe tree damage including significant mortality on specific plant species, belonging to the Palmae family and restricted to plant sizes with a diameter of the stem at the base of over 5\u00a0cm (susceptible plants). The susceptible plants are present in many parts of Europe, mainly in the south where they are planted in large numbers for ornamental purposes and where they are of high environmental importance.\n(4) It is therefore necessary to take emergency measures against the introduction into and spread within the Community of the specified organism.\n(5) Those emergency measures should apply to the introduction and the spread of the specified organism, the demarcation of areas in the Community where the specified organism is present, the import, production, movement and control of susceptible plants in the Community. A survey to check for the presence or continued absence of the specified organism should be carried out on all plants of Palmae in the Member States to collect more scientific information about the susceptibility of plants.\n(6) It is appropriate that the results of the measures be reviewed by 31 March 2008 taking into account the experiences from the first growing season under the emergency measures.\n(7) Member States should, if necessary, adapt their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018specified organism\u2019 means Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier);\n(b) \u2018susceptible plants\u2019 means plants, other than fruit and seeds, having a diameter of the stem at the base of over 5\u00a0cm of Areca catechu, Arenga pinnata, Borassus flabellifer, Calamus merillii, Caryota maxima, Caryota cumingii, Cocos nucifera, Corypha gebanga, Corypha elata, Elaeis guineensis, Livistona decipiens, Metroxylon sagu, Oreodoxa regia, Phoenix canariensis, Phoenix dactylifera, Phoenix theophrasti, Phoenix sylvestris, Sabal umbraculifera, Trachycarpus fortunei and Washingtonia spp.;\n(c) \u2018place of production\u2019 means the place of production as defined in the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No\u00a05\u00a0(2).", "Emergency measures against the specified organism\nThe introduction into and spread within the Community of the specified organism shall be prohibited.", "Import of susceptible plants\nSusceptible plants may be introduced into the Community only if:\n(a) they comply with the specific import requirements in point 1 of Annex I;\n(b) they are, on entry into the Community, inspected by the responsible official body for the presence of the specified organism, in accordance with Article 13a(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, and no signs of the specified organism have been found.", "Movement of susceptible plants within the Community\nSusceptible plants originating in the Community or imported into the Community in accordance with Article 3 may be moved within the Community only if they meet the conditions in point 2 of Annex I.", "Surveys and notifications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism or evidence of infection by the specified organism on plants of Palmae in their territory.\nWithout prejudice to Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of those surveys, together with the list of demarcated areas referred to in Article 6, shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States by 28 February of each year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any suspected occurrence or confirmed presence of the specified organism shall immediately be notified to the responsible official bodies.", "Establishment of demarcated areas\nWhen the results of the surveys referred to in Article 5(1) or the notifications referred to in Article 5(2) confirm the presence of the specified organism in an area, or there is evidence of the presence of the specified organism by other means, Member States shall define demarcated areas and take official measures as laid down in points 1 and 2 respectively of Annex II.", "Compliance\nMember States shall, if necessary, amend the measures which they have adopted to protect themselves against the introduction and spread of the specified organism in such a manner that those measures comply with this Decision.
