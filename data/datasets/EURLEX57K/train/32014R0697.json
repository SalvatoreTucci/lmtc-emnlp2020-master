That Regulation will expire on 25 April 2015, in accordance with the maximum 5-year duration provided for in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 246/2009. On the basis of the Commission's experience in applying the block exemption, it appears that the justifications for a block exemption for consortia are still valid and that the conditions on the basis of which the scope and content of Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 were determined have not substantially changed.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 simplified and introduced substantial modifications to the rules applicable to consortia. Since the new legal framework has been in place and applied for only a short period of time, further changes should be avoided at this stage. This will avoid increasing the compliance costs of the operators in the industry.\n(3) The period of application of Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 should therefore be extended by five years,", "main_body": ["In Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 906/2009 \u201825 April 2015\u2019 is replaced by \u201825 April 2020\u2019.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
