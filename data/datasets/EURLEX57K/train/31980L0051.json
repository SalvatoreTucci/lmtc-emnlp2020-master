Member States may exempt from the provisions of Article 3 aircraft which do not satisfy the applicable requirements for noise certification in the case of:    (a) aircraft which replace an equivalent number of aircraft which have been accidentally destroyed and which cannot be replaced by a comparable aircraft with noise certification available on the market, provided that the registration of the replacement aircraft is is carried out within one year following the destruction in question;\n(b) aircraft of historic interest;\n(c) aircraft in respect of which an operator demonstrates that the pursuit of his operations would otherwise be adversely affected to an unreasonable extent, provided always that in such cases they be removed from the register not later than 31 December 1984.\nA Member State may, however, require aircraft covered by the exemptions provided for in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph to comply with Article 3 if they use airports in that Member State.
