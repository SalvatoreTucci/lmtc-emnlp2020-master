In the interests of legal clarity, therefore, Regulation (EU) No 298/2013 should be repealed.\n(7) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation must enter into force on the day of its publication,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 314/2004 is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 6, the following paragraph is added:\n(2) the Annex to this Regulation is added as Annex IV.", "Regulation (EU) No 298/2013 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 February 2014.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
