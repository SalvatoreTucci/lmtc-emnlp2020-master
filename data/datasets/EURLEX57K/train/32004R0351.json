and\n(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.\n(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.\n(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.\n(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(2), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(3), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.\n(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.\n(9) With a view to enlargement on 1 May 2004 and to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the new Member States on the Community level, all remaining refunds for exports to the new Member States should be abolished.\n(10) The consolidation of the maximum quantities for export within the limits set in the WTO Agreement will be more binding on the accession of the new Member States. In order to ensure the satisfactory management and optimum use of the maximum quantities for export, steps should therefore be taken to reduce or abolish the refunds for certain destinations, in particular those located in or close to the geographical area of the Community where the level of prices for milk products no longer justify the present level of refund rates, despite the collection of import duty in some of those countries.\n(11) The policy of some non-member countries is to prevent disturbance on the internal market by applying frontier measures. The refunds for certain milk products exported to those destinations should be differentiated in order to reduce the risk of such measures being applied.\n(12) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["The export refunds referred to in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on products exported in the natural state shall be as set out in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 27 February 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 February 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 48.
