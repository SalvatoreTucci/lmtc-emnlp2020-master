The maximum permissible doses of those substances are fixed in Annex IV.\n(3) Experiments concerning the use of lysozyme in winemaking carried out by two Member States have shown that the addition of this substance is of significant benefit for the stabilisation of wines and permits the production of quality wines with a reduced sulphur dioxide content. Its use should therefore be permitted and maximum doses laid down in line with the technological requirements revealed in the experiments.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly to permit the use of lysozyme fulfilling the purity criteria laid down by Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(5), as last amended by Directive 2001/30/EC(6).\n(5) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 is amended as follows:\n1.
