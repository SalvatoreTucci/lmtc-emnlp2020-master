whereas the quantities put on the market at the beginning and at the end of the marketing year represent  only a relatively small percentage of that marketed over the whole marketing year; whereas the reference price should therefore be fixed only for the period running from 1 December to the last day of February of the following year;\nWhereas the fixing of a single reference price valid for the whole marketing year appears to be the solution most suited to the particular nature of the Community market in the product in question;\nWhereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the amount referred to in paragraph 2 (a) of that Article and the  standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:\n- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and\n- the amount referred to in paragraph 2 (a) of that Article,\n- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;\nWhereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State, with regard to Article 23, of the amount referred to in paragraph 2 (a), plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount  has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;\nWhereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;\nWhereas Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 of 28 December 1992 on transitional measures for the application of the agrimonetary arrangements laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (6) establishes a correspondence between the  provisions of the agrimonetary arrangements applicable form 1 January 1993 and those applicable before that date;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 establishes a list of prices and amounts for the fruit and vegetables sector which are to divided by a coefficient of 1,010495, fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 537/93 (7) amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1331/93 (8), as  from the beginning of the 1993/94 marketing year; whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 lays down tht the resulting reduction in the prices and amounts for each sector concerned shall be specified and the level of such reduced prices fixed;  whereas, however, this adjustment may not result in a reference price level below that of the preceding marketing year, in accordance with Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["For the 1993/94 marketing year, the reference price for fresh clementines (CN code ex 0805 20 10) expressed in ecus per 100 kilograms net of packed products of quality class I, of all sizes, shall, for the period 1 December 1993 to 28  February 1994, be: 59,57.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 November 1993.\nFor the Commission\nRen\u0102\u0160 STEICHEN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 118, 20. 5. 1972, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 69, 20. 3. 1993, p. 7.\n(3) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 1.\n(4) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 29.\n(5) OJ No L 158, 30. 6. 1993, p. 18.\n(6) OJ No L 387, 31. 12. 1992, p. 22.\n(7) OJ No L 57, 10. 3. 1993, p. 18.\n(8) OJ No L 132, 29. 5. 1993, p. 114."}
