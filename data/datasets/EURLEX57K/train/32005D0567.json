A Notice of Initiation was therefore published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the 23 October 2004\u00a0(2).\n(5) During the investigation, the Government of Uruguay expressed its readiness to seek a negotiated solution to the issues raised in the complaint, and proposed:\n(a) to withdraw the requirement that whisky be aged less than three years to be included in the lowest tax category. The measure will take effect from 1 July 2005;\n(b) to apply the same treatment to domestic and imported whiskies as regards the requirement to affix strip stamps. The Eastern Republic of Uruguay will amend its regulations by 30 June 2005 and the measure will enter into force after a transitional period of 90 days;\n(c) to promote a change in the structure of the IMESI tax in order to bring it in line with the most usual tax systems at the international level. This change would help to address the issue of the alleged lack of transparency and predictability. The reform process is expected to be finalised by the end of 2006.\n(6) The Commission considers therefore that it is appropriate to suspend the procedure.\n(7) The Community will monitor the implementation of the negotiated solution and will terminate the procedure when the Government of Uruguay has fulfilled its commitments.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Advisory Committee,", "main_body": ["The examination procedure concerning obstacles to trade, consisting of measures imposed and practices followed by the Eastern Republic of Uruguay affecting trade in Scotch whisky, is hereby suspended."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 2005.\nFor the Commission\nPeter MANDELSON\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 349, 31.12.1994, p. 71.
