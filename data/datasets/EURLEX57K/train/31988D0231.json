whereas the Guideline Framework for Positive Action which is defined in the Annex to recommendation 86/379/EEC stresses in II (1) the importance of 'ensuring that disabled people live in an environment which makes it possible for them to benefit from further education and training and to make their full contribution to the economy';\nWhereas, in its resolution of 22 December 1986 on an action programme on employment growth (2), the Council advocated special provisions in training for the disadvantaged and disabled;\nWhereas the second Council resolution of 24 July 1986 on the promotion of equal opportunities for women (3) and the conclusions of the Council of Ministers for Education, meeting within the Council, of 14 May 1987 concerning a European cooperation programme for the integration of handicapped persons (4) call for consistency in this action;\nWhereas the present programme is designed to complement action taken at national level, in particular by ensuring coordination of these actions and exchanges of experience gleaned from them;\nWhereas the main responsibility for the social integration and independent way of life of handicapped persons lies with the Member States but cooperation action at Community level may help Member States to improve the effectiveness of the measures which they take in this area;\nWhereas in the field of disability, training and employment, measures will be ineffective unless they are complemented by measures to ensure the necessary support for an independent way of life;\nWhereas certain activities covered by the present programme fall outside the scope of the European Social Fund but can complement activities eligible for support from that Fund in respect of vocational rehabilitation and training of disabled people;\nWhereas this programme constitutes a positive response at Community level to the wishes expressed in particular by the European Parliament with regard to Community initiatives designed to meet the needs, aspirations and potential of the 30 million and more disabled people in the Community, in the form of actions which cover all the services relevant to full integration and an independent way of life;\nWhereas this programme will enable people to become aware of the important contribution which new technology can make to improving the lives of the disabled, and, in particular, their vocational opportunities; whereas it will thereby also help in developing the market for the relevant products of new technology, in line with the Commission's White Paper on completing the internal market;\nWhereas this programme is designed to ensure that the Community will be able to continue to contribute to the World Action Programme established by the United Nations in this field; whereas it should also lend support to the principles enshrined in Resolution AP (84) 3 of the Council of Europe on a consistent policy for the rehabilitation of handicapped persons;\nWhereas, because this decision is concerned on the one hand with principles for implementing a common vocational training policy for disabled people and on the other with measures, including those to promote the social integration and independent way of life of the disabled, which need to be adopted in order to achieve one of the objectives of the Community but for which the Treaty has not provided the necessary specific powers, it is necessary to invoke both Article 128 and Article 235 of the Treaty;\nWhereas, however, these principles and measures concern the same category of person, namely the disabled, and whereas their common purpose is to help such persons lead a normal life and improve their social integration; whereas these principles and measures should be considered as a single programme and amalgamated in a single decision,", "main_body": ["A Community action programme to promote vocational training and rehabilitation, economic integration, social integration and an independent way of life for disabled people, (Helios programme), hereinafter called 'the programme', is hereby established for the period 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1991.", "For the purposes of the programme, 'disabled people' means all people with serious disabilities resulting from physical or mental impairments.", "The objectives of the programme shall be as follows:\n(a) to develop, in the fields of vocational training and rehabilitation, economic integration, social integration and an independent way of life for disabled people, a Community approach based on the best innovatory experience in the Member States;\n(b) in the fields referred to in point (a), to develop exchange and information activities which fall outside the scope of the European Social Fund but can make a useful contribution in these areas;\n(c) to contribute to the implementation of recommendation 86/379/EEC and of the resolution of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council of 21 December 1981;\n(d) to continue and, where necessary, extend Community support to the European cooperation of non-governmental organizations in the fields referred to in point (a);\n(e) to give appropriate attention to:\n- the vocational needs of disabled women and the promotion of their social integration and independent way of life,\n- those with special responsibilities in caring for disabled children or adults at home.", "1.
