To prevent confusion between the name of the protected designation of origin \u2018Prosecco\u2019 and the name of the vine variety, the term \u2018Prosecco\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018Glera\u2019 when it refers to the vine variety in Regulation (EC) No 606/2009.\n(3) The Italian authorities have officially indicated that the \u2018Prosecco/Glera\u2019 variety may not be cultivated in the Trentino-Alto Adige region; consequently Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 should no longer refer to that region as one where that variety may be produced.\n(4) There is a typographical error in Annex IA, Appendix 7, to Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 in the requirements for electrodialysis treatment. The units for the maximum limit in the simulator should be expressed in \u03bcg/l and not in g/l.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 should be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 606/2009 became applicable on 1 August 2009.
