It is therefore necessary to align Directive 2000/25/EC with the provisions of Directive 97/68/EC as amended.\n(3) Annex XII to Directive 97/68/EC has been amended by Commission Directive 2012/46/EU\u00a0(3) in order to introduce new alternative type-approvals according to technical progress at the UNECE level and so as to ensure international harmonisation with respect to alternative type-approval procedures. Those alternative type-approval provisions should therefore be introduced into Directive 2000/25/EC. In addition, it is necessary to update the references to Regulations No 49 and No 96 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) to ensure that they correspond to the amendments to Directive 97/68/EC with respect to the recognition of alternative type-approvals for engines intended to power agricultural and forestry tractors.\n(4) Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 20 of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2000/25/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the 1 January 2015 at the latest.
