Products within those tariff quotas can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates. For the same reasons,with effect from 1 January 2011 new tariff quotas at a zero duty rate for an appropriate volume for certain additional products should be opened.\n(2) The quota volume for autonomous tariff quotas entered with the order numbers 09.2977 and 09.2635 are insufficient to meet the needs of the industry of the Union for the current quota period ending on 31 December 2010. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased with effect from 1 July 2010.\n(3) It is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant tariff quotas in 2011 for certain products for which such quotas were established for 2010. Those quotas should therefore be closed with effect from 1 January 2011 and the products concerned should be deleted from the list in Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.\n(4) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/10 to be replaced in its entirety.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the tariff quotas have to take effect from 1 January 2011, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "With effect from 1 July 2010, in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010:\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number 09.2977 is fixed at 40\u00a0000 tonnes,\n\u2014 the quota volume of the tariff quota for order number 09.2635 is fixed at 1\u00a0300\u00a0000\u00a0km,", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2011.", "shall apply from 1 July 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
