The governments of the countries concerned were separately invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as regards the content of the complaint and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. During the consultations no mutually agreed solution was found.\n(5) The Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union\n\u00a0(2), accordingly initiated an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned, currently falling within CN codes 7318\u00a012\u00a010, 7318\u00a014\u00a010, 7318\u00a015\u00a030, 7318\u00a015\u00a051, 7318\u00a015\u00a061 and 7318\u00a015\u00a070.\n(6) On the same day, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned\u00a0(3).\n(7) The Commission sent questionnaires to the Union industry and to any known association of producers in the Union, to the exporters/producers in the countries concerned, to any association of exporters/producers, to the importers, to any known association of importers, and to the authorities of the countries concerned. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(8) By its letter of 1 April 2010 to the Commission, EIFI formally withdrew its complaint.\n(9) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(10) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia, currently falling within CN codes 7318\u00a012\u00a010, 7318\u00a014\u00a010, 7318\u00a015\u00a030, 7318\u00a015\u00a051, 7318\u00a015\u00a061 and 7318\u00a015\u00a070, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0188, 18.7.2009, p.\u00a093.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0190, 13.8.2009, p.\u00a032.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0190, 13.8.2009, p.\u00a027."}
