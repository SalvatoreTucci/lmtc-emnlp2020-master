Amongst the Member States concerned, Luxembourg and Malta notified their intention to continue transferring the whole amount of their budget for the support programmes in the wine sector as set in Annex Xb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. However, the fact that the amount had slightly increased for financial year 2014 compared to that available for financial year 2013 for these two Member States was not taken into account when adapting the national ceilings for direct payments for claim year 2013. The respective national ceilings as referred to in Article 40(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be adapted accordingly.\n(3) In accordance with Article 103n of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, Spain, Luxembourg, Malta and the United Kingdom notified the Commission of their intention to definitively transfer part or all of the amount available for the support programmes referred to in Annex Xb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in order to increase their national ceilings for direct payments referred to in Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for claim years 2014 and onwards.

On the basis of the schedule of increments referred to in Article 121 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, and in accordance with Article 57a(7) of that Regulation, the respective national ceilings as referred to in Article 40(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be adapted accordingly.\n(5) Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The
