The substitution of lead in MCPs is scientifically and technically impracticable.\n(3) The substitution of MCPs as components with alternative detectors is not viable under conditions where extreme miniaturisation, very short response times or very high signal multiplication factors are required. The use of lead in those cases where the performance and specific features of MCPs exceed alternative detectors should therefore be exempted from the prohibition. As currently no lead-free alternatives are in sight, pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2011/65/EU, the validity period of the exemption should be 7 years from the relevant compliance dates for medical devices, monitoring and control instruments, in vitro medical devices and industrial monitoring and control instruments, as laid down in Article 4(3) of Directive 2011/65/EU. In view of the innovation cycles for all medical devices and monitoring and control instruments 7 years is a relatively short transition period which is unlikely to have adverse impacts on innovation.\n(4) Directive 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex IV to Directive 2011/65/EU is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by the last day of the sixth month after entry into force at the latest.
