These studies are not yet concluded.\n(6) Member States which require additional warnings in the form of colour photographs or other illustrations, as referred to in Article 5(3) of Directive 2001/37/EC need to have at their disposal the selected source documents sufficiently in advance in order to transpose Directive 2012/9/EU.\n(7) Given the complexity of the process of updating the library of selected source documents and amending Decision C(2005) 1452, there is a risk that the process will not have been concluded within a timeframe that would allow Member States sufficient time to comply with the deadline for transposition of Directive 2012/9/EU.\n(8) In order to ensure that Member States have adequate time it is appropriate to postpone the deadlines for the transposition of Directive 2012/9/EU and for the end of the transitional period provided for by that Directive.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 2012/9/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 2(1) \u201828 March 2014\u2019 is replaced by \u201828 March 2016\u2019;\n(2) in Article 3 \u201828 March 2016\u2019 is replaced by \u201828 March 2018\u2019.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 March 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 194, 18.7.2001, p. 26.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2012/9/EU of 7 March 2012, amending Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (OJ L 69, 8.3.2012, p. 15).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2003/641/EC of 5 September 2003 on the use of colour photographs or other illustrations as health warnings on tobacco packages (OJ L 226, 10.9.2003, p. 24)."}
