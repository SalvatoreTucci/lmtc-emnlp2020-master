Persuant to its Article 2, the measures include the application of a minimum import price (MIP).\n(2) In particular, Article 2(3) of the definitive Regualtion sets the level of the MIP applicable until 15 April 2005.\n(3) Recital (112) of the definitive Regulation calls for an early review before the entry into force of the revised MIP, should this be warranted.\n(4) In line with the provisions of recital 112, the Commission is currently conducting a monitoring of the market and the development of prices. At this stage, it has not yet been possible to reach a conclusion on the appropriateness of a definitive minimum import price.
