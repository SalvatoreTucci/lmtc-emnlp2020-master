This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(6).\n(9) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,", "main_body": ["This Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.\nIt shall not apply to products intended for the manufacture of fine bakery wares, pastries or biscuits.", "Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Annex I hereto, subject to the following conditions:\n1.
