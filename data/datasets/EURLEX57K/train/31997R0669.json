whereas the said Community tariff quotas and ceilings in respect of products originating in the Faroe Islands should therefore be opened for the volumes indicated respectively in Annexes I and II to this Regulation and Community statistical surveillance established in respect of the products listed in Annex III thereto;\n(3) Whereas the preferential rates of duty indicated in Annexes I, II and III apply only where the free-at-frontier price determined by the Member States in accordance with Article 22 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization of the market in fishery products and aquaculture (2) is at least equal to the reference price set, or to be set, by the Community for the products or categories of products concerned;\n(4) Whereas, for reasons of simplification, provision should be made to empower the Commission to give effect, following receipt of the opinion of the Customs Code Committee set up by Article 247 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (3), to necessary amendments and technical adaptations to the Annexes to this Regulation arising from amendments of the combined nomenclature and Taric codes and to adaptations of volume, periods and quota rates arising from decisions by the Council or by the Commission;\n(5) Whereas, for the same reasons, provision should be made for this procedure to be applied in cases where the abovementioned Agreement is amended to the extent that the agreed amendments specify the products eligible for tariff quotas or subject to tariff ceilings or to statistical surveillance, quota-volumes, duties and tariff periods, and any eligibility criteria;\n(6) Whereas the Agreement provides for tariff quotas, tariff ceilings and statistical surveillance for an indefinite period; whereas, therefore, to make implementation of the measures concerned more efficient and simpler, this Regulation should apply on a multiannual basis;\n(7) Whereas equal and continuous access to the quotas in respect of the products likely to benefit from the Community tariff quotas listed in Annex I should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates of duty laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question in all Member States until the quotas are exhausted;\n(8) Whereas the Community should take the decision to open tariff quotas in the execution of its international obligations; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reason why the Member States should not be authorized to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration does, however, require close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which must be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;\n(9) Whereas, in respect of products listed in Annex II and subject to Community tariff ceilings, Community surveillance may be effected by charging imports of these products against the ceilings at Community level as and when the products are presented at customs and declared for free circulation; whereas this method of administering the ceilings should enable customs duties to be restored as soon as the ceilings in question are reached at Community level;\n(10) Whereas this method of administering the ceilings calls for close and especially speedy cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which must be able to monitor the level reached by imports charged against the ceilings and inform the Member States accordingly; whereas this cooperation should be close enough to allow the Commission to take appropriate steps to restore customs duties as soon as one of the ceilings is reached;\n(11) Whereas, for the products listed in Annex III, it would seem appropriate to have recourse to the system of statistical surveillance administered by the Commission pursuant to the relevant provisions of Regulations (EC) No 1172/95 (4) and (EEC) No 2658/87 (5);\n(12) Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1983/95 (6), which brought into force the measures applicable pursuant to the old agreement, should be repealed,", "main_body": ["From 1 January to 31 December each year, the customs duties applicable to imports into the Community of products listed in Annex I and originating in the Faroe Islands shall be suspended at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas specified therein.", "The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission, which may take any appropriate administrative measure to ensure efficient operation.", "Where an importer enters a product covered by this Regulation for free circulation in a Member State accompanied by:\n- a request for preferential treatment, and\n- a movement certificate, complying with the rules laid down in the Protocol concerning the definition of the concept of originating products and methods of administrative cooperation annexed to Decision 97/126/EC (7),\nand his declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member State concerned shall, by notifying the Commission accordingly, draw a quantity from the quota concerned to satisfy the requirement.\nApplications for drawings from the quotas shall indicate the date on which the declarations were accepted and shall be sent to the Commission forthwith.\nDrawings shall be granted by the Commission on the basis of the date when the declarations for free circulation were accepted by the customs authorities of the Member State concerned, provided the available balance is sufficient.\nWhere a Member State fails to use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the relevant quota.\nWhere the quantities applied for are in excess of the available balance, allocation shall be made in proportion to the requirements.

As soon as the ceilings are reached, the Commission may, by adopting a Regulation, resume the collection of the customs duties applicable to third countries until the end of the calendar year.\n4.
