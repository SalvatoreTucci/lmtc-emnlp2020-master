For the sake of harmonisation, imports under the quotas of \"baby beef\" originating in Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should also be made subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex III to the Interim Agreements with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and with Croatia. A model should also be established for the certificates of authenticity and detailed rules laid down for their use.\n(4) Kosovo, as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, is subject to an international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which has also set up a separate customs service. There should therefore also be a specific certificate of authenticity for goods originating in the FRY/Kosovo.\n(5) The quotas concerned should be managed through the use of import licences.
