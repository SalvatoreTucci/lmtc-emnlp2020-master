The main constituent, with the highest concentration, is d-Limonene, followed by \u03b3-Terpinene. The essential oils are extracted from the whole fruit or exclusively from the peel using mechanical means and the quantity produced depends on a number of factors, such as the degree of ripeness of the fruit, its size and the method used.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area\n\u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 must be grown, harvested, sorted and graded on the islands of Chios, Psara and Inousses.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2014\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\n\u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 processed into confectionery, juices and other products such as essential oils must be labelled in accordance with the \u2027Commission Communication - Guidelines on the labelling of foodstuffs using protected designations of origin (PDOs) or protected geographical indications (PGIs) as ingredients\u2027 (OJ C 341, 16.12.2010, pp. 3 and 4).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nProtection of the name is requested for the islands of Chios, Psara and Inousses.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nSoil \u2013 the geological substratum is made up of alluvial deposits from the disintegration of limestone. Most of the soils are loamy and rich in total and active calcium (CaCO3), two favourable factors for the growing of \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027.\nClimate \u2013 the area\u2019s climate is characterised by:\nannual Etesian winds (Meltemi winds, which in the Mediterranean area are found only in the Aegean) that help maintain stable temperatures (producing a milder climate and generally protecting the fruit from frost) and disperse any clouds,\na high level of sunshine throughout the year (Chios has more hours without cloud than anywhere else in Greece) and particularly during the period of the annual winds, when the hours of sunshine are greatest, and\na small temperature range throughout the year and, consequently, short, mild winters and cool summers.\nThe climate described above together with (a) the maintenance of high surface-water temperatures (>22\u00a0\u00b0C), even in autumn, (b) the terrain, which allows greater exposure to the sun, and (c) the properties of the soils, as described in the previous point, have influenced the size and quality of the fruit grown, since a high sugar content due to the high exposure to the sun and high daytime temperatures that promote photosynthesis, as well as the rapid breakdown of acids due to high night-time temperatures, lead to an increased maturity index.\nSugar\nAcidity as citric acid\nand consequently a sweet taste and an intense aroma.\nHuman factors \u2013 \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 has been grown continually over many decades, with practices being adapted as necessary, and this has led to the construction of suitable buildings and the development of practices totally adapted to production. These can be summarised as follows:\n\u2014 the special architecture of many of the buildings/homes of the owners of agricultural holdings, which stand inside the orchards and are usually two-storied to permit better monitoring of the crop.\n\u2014 the irrigation system, which uses ditches and capstans to draw water of excellent quality from wells. It should be noted that the island\u2019s irrigation system was developed in the 14th century by the Genoese, who also built drainage systems not found anywhere else in the world at that time.\n\u2014 the intelligent harvesting methods that were developed. According to many sources, the growers of Chios were alone among the Greeks in knowing the correct method of cutting the fruit from the tree, i.e. using shears and then cutting the stalks close to the fruit, leaving only the peduncle, so as to avoid long stalks causing any damage to the fruit during their transportation in buckets and crates.\n\u2014 the techniques and practices for applying fertiliser that were developed, inter alia, the general use of manure from the cattle, sheep, goats and poultry that the citrus-fruit growers farmed together with their fruit trees. The use of manure, although remaining one of the main methods for nourishing the trees, is tending to disappear as manure is no longer available in sufficient quantities.\n\u2014 the techniques and practices adopted to protect the trees against frost, including controlled fires, \u2027tichoyiria\u2027 (enclosure walls) and the high planting density used, with a minimum distance between trees of 2 to 2,5\u00a0m (around 100 trees per 1\u00a0000\u00a0m2).\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 is one of the most celebrated traditional agricultural products of Greece and, together with \u2027Mastiha Chiou PDO\u2027 (Chios mastic) is the Prefecture\u2019s most important product. It is greatly sought after for its particular flavour and its characteristic intense aroma. The variety of mandarins grown in Chios is unique. It is said to be among the best and most aromatic in the world. Even unripe mandarins are so fragrant that anyone eating them is amazed by the persistence of their aroma. The aroma from orchards planted with \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 is so intense that Chios has become known both in Greece and abroad as \u2027fragrant\u2027 Chios. This comes as no surprise to visitors, since it is said that the perfumes arising from the district of Kampos can be smelled even out at sea, from the very first moment visitors begin their journey to the green heart of the island.\nThe application for \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 to be registered as a PGI product is based on its reputation, which derives from a particular quality. The term \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 was established on the fresh-fruit market at the end of the 19th century to identify and request an original, sought-after product with a characteristic intense aroma and a particular flavour, grown on Chios in a way that contributed to the product\u2019s special commercial value.\nIn order to preserve the fruit\u2019s special properties \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 used to be wrapped in paper after harvesting. This procedure was invented by growers in Chios and was used nowhere else in Greece. The earliest written evidence for wrapping the mandarins in paper in Chios is from the French writer A. Testevuide in the French travel review \u2027Le Tour du Monde\u2027 in 1878.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or another characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe product\u2019s excellent reputation is the result of a combination of its innate properties and effective human intervention.\nIn any case, \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 is held in great esteem by consumers, both in Greece and abroad, principally because of its characteristic aroma and its special flavour, factors that in the past were instrumental in the flowering of the local economy and the development of trade with European countries (Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Poland and Germany). References to the above can be found in the writings of many famous travellers (Galland, Testevuide, \u0396\u03bflontas, \u03a4\u03bfmbazis, Sgouros and Sotiriadou).\nThe physical environment has also made an important contribution to the product\u2019s reputation, particularly the area\u2019s soil and climate, while the propagation of the product\u2019s special characteristics has been greatly facilitated by the integration of mandarin growing into the islands' wider economic and commercial environment.\nFinally, it should be noted that the reputation of \u2027Mandarini Chiou\u2027 is due, to a great extent, to the special characteristics of the agricultural area in which it is grown - it is not by chance that the island is known as \u2027fragrant\u2027 Chios.\nPublication reference of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nhttp://www.minagric.gr/greek/data/Allin1_for%20CD01.pdf"}
