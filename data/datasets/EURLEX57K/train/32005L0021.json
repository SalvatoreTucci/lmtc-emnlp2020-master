It is therefore necessary to align the technical requirements relating to the light source of the opacimeter used for the measurement of the opacity of the exhaust with UN-ECE Regulation 24 and international standards. It is also appropriate to align the fuel used for measuring the opacity of the exhaust with the fuel permitted for the measurement of emissions, as given in Council Directive 88/77/EEC\u00a0(4).\n(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["The Annexes to Directive 72/306/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "With effect from 9 March 2006, Member States:\n\u2014 shall no longer grant EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, and\n\u2014 may refuse national type-approval,\nfor a new type of vehicle on grounds relating to the emission of pollutants from diesel engines if it fails to comply with the provisions of Directive 72/306/EEC, as amended by this Directive.\nThis Directive shall not invalidate any approval previously granted pursuant to Directive 72/306/EEC nor prevent extensions to such approvals under the terms of the Directive under which they were originally granted.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 8 March 2006.
