It also provides for certain zones to be recognised as protected zones.\n(2) From information supplied by Portugal, it appears that Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations) is now established in the Alentejo region and in some communes of the Ribatejo e Oeste region. These parts of the Portuguese territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n(3) From information supplied by Slovenia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in the Gorenjska and Maribor regions. These regions should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.)

Winsl. et al. is now established in certain communes of the Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda, Levice, Topo\u013e\u010dany, Polt\u00e1r, Ro\u017e\u0148ava and Trebi\u0161ov Counties.

Those parts of the Italian territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.)

Lithuania should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus.\n(7) The relevant Annexes to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I to IV to Directive 2000/29/EC are amended in accordance with the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 April 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
