Assembly of a multidisciplinary team\nThis team, which involves all parts of the enterprise concerned with the product, needs to include the whole range of specific knowledge and expertise appropriate to the product under consideration, its production (manufacture, storage, and  distribution), its consumption and the associated potential hazards.\nWhere necessary, the team will be assisted by specialists who will help it to solve its difficulties as regards assessment and control of critical points.\nThe team may consist of:\n- a quality control specialist who understands the biological, chemical or physical hazards connected with a particular product group,\n- a production specialist who has responsibility for, or is closely involved with, the technical process of manufacturing the product under study,\n- a technician who has a working knowledge of the hygiene and operation of the process plant and equipment,\n- any other person with specialist knowledge of microbiology, hygiene and food technology.\nOne person may fulfil several of these roles, provided all relevant information is available to the team and is used to ensure that the own-checks system developed is reliable. Where expertise is not available in the establishment, advice should be  obtained from other sources (consultancy, guides of good manufacturing practices, etc.).\n2. Description of the product\nThe end product should be described in terms of:\n- composition (e.g. raw materials, ingredients, additives, etc.),\n- structure and physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. solid, liquid, gel, emulsion, Aw, Ph, etc.),\n- processing (e.g. heating, freezing, drying, salting, smoking, etc. and to what extent),\n- packaging (e.g. hermetic, vacuum, modified atmosphere),\n- storage and distribution conditions,\n- required shelf life (e.g. sell by date and best before date),\n- instructions for use,\n- any microbiological or chemical criteria applicable.\n3. Identification of intended use\nThe multidisciplinary team should also define the normal or expected use of the product by the customer and the consumer target groups for which the product is intended. In specific cases, the suitability of the product for particular groups of  consumers, such as institutional caterers, travellers, etc. and for vulnerable groups of the population may have to be considered.\n4. Construction of a flow diagram (Description of manufacturing process)\nWhatever the format chosen all steps involved in the process, including delays during or between steps, from receiving the raw materials to placing the end product on the market, through preparation, processing, packaging, storage and distribution,  should be studied in sequence and presented in a detailed flow diagram with sufficient technical data.\nTypes of data may include but are not limited to:\n- plan of working premises and ancillary premises,\n- equipment layout and characteristics,\n- sequence of all process steps (including the incorporation of raw materials, ingredients or additives and delays during or between steps),\n- technical parameters of operations (in particular time and temperature, including delays),\n- flow of products (including potential cross-contamination),\n- segregation of clean and dirty areas (or high/low risk areas),\n- cleaning and disinfectrion procedures,\n- hygienic environment of the establishment,\n- personnel routes and hygiene practices,\n- product storage and distribution conditions.\n5. On-site confirmation of flow diagram\nAfter the flow diagram has been drawn up, the multidisciplinary team should confirm it on site during operating hours. Any observed deviation must result in an amendment of the original flow diagram to make it accurate.\n6. Listing of hazards and control measures\nUsing the confirmed flow diagram as a guide, the team should:\n(a) list all potential biological, chemical or physical hazards that may be reasonably expected to occur at each process step (including acquisition and storage of raw materials and ingredients and delays during manufacture).\nA hazard is a potential to cause harm to health and is anything covered by the hygiene objectives of Directive 91/493/EEC. Specifically, it can be any of the following:\n- unacceptable contamination (or recontamination) of a biological (micro-organisms, parasites), chemical or physical nature of raw materials, intermediate products or final products,\n- unacceptable survival or multiplication of pathogenic micro-organisms and unacceptable generation of chemicals in intermediate products, final products, production line or line environment,\n- unacceptable production or persistence of toxins or other undesirable products of microbial metabolism.\nFor inclusion in the list, hazards must be of a nature such that their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the to the production of safe food.\n(b) consider and describe what control measures, if any, exist which can be applied for each hazard.\nControl measures are those actions and activities that can be used to prevent hazards, eliminate them or reduce their impact or occurrence to acceptable levels.\nMore than one control measure may be required to control an identified hazard and more than one hazard may be controlled by one control measure. For instance, pasteurization or controlled heat treatment may provide sufficient assurance of reduction of  the level of both salmonella and listeria.\nControl measures need to be supported by detailed procedures and specifications to ensure their effective implementation. For instance, detailed cleaning schedules, precise heat treatment specifications, maximum concentrations of preservatives used in  compliance with the applicable Community rules on additives and in particular Directive 89/107/EEC (1).\n7. Methods for identification of criticla points\nThe identification of a critical point for the control of a hazard requires a logical approach. Such an approach can be facilitated by the use of the following decision tree (other methods can be used by the team, according to their knowledge and  experience).\nDecision tree for the identification of critical points\nAnswer each question in sequence, at each step and for each identified hazard.\nFor the application of the decision tree, each process step identified in the flow diagram should be considered in sequence. At each step, the decision tree must be applied to each hazard that may be reasonably expected to occur or be introduced and  each control measure identified.\nApplication of the decision tree should be flexible and requires common sense, having consideration for the whole manufacturing process in order to avoid, whenever possible, unnecessary critical points.\n8. Action to be taken following identification of a critical point\nThe identification of critical points has two consequences for the multidisciplinary team which should then:\n- ensure that appropriate control measures are effectively designed and implemented. In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step,or at any other, then  the product or process should be modified at that step, or at any other, then the product or process should be modified at that step, or at an earlier or later stage, to include a control measure,\n- establish and implement a monitoring and checking system at each critical point.\nCHAPTER II:   ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MONITORING AND CHECKING CRITICAL POINTS  An appropriate monitoring and checking system is essential to ensure the effective control of each critical point.\nTo develop such a system, it is recommended to proceed to the following activities:\n1. Establishment of critical limits for each control measure associated with each critical point\nEach control measure associated with a critical point should give rise to the specification of critical limits.\nThose critical limits correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. They separate acceptability from unacceptability. They are set for observable or measurable parameters which can readily demonstrate that the critical point  is under control; they should be based on substantiated evidence that chosen values will result in process control.\nExamples of such parameters include temperature, time, pH, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, sensory parameters such as visual appearance or texture, ect.\nIn some cases, to reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent levels (i.e. target levels) to assure that critical limits are observed.\nCritical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. When not taken from regulatory standards (e.g. frozen storage temperature) or from existing and validated guides of good manufactoring practices, the team should ascertain their validity relative  to the control of identified hazard and critical points.\n2. Establishment of a monitoring and checking system for each critical point\nAn essential part of own-checks is a programme of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified critical limits. The programme should describe the methods, the frequency of observations or measurements  and the recording procedure.\nObservations or measurements must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in time for corrective action to be taken.\nObservations or measurements can be made continuously or discontinuously. When observations or measurements are not continuous, it is necessary to establish a frequency of observations or measurements which provides reliable information.\nThe programme of observations or measurements should properly identify for each critical point:\n- who is to perform monitoring and checking,\n- when monitoring and checking is performed,\n- how monitoring and checking is performed.\n3. Establishment of a corrective action plan\nObservations or measurements may indicate:\n- that the parameter monitored tends to deviate from its specified critical limits, indicating a trend toward loss of control. Appropriate corrective action to maintain control must be taken before the occurence of hazard,\n- that the parameter monitored has deviated from its specified critical limits, indicating a loss of control. It is necessary to take appropriate corrective action to regain control.\nCorrective action has to be planned in advance by the multidisciplinary team, for each critical point, so that it can be taken without hesitation when a deviation is observed.\nSuch corrective action should include:\n- proper identification of the person(s) responsible for the implementation of the corrective action,\n- description of means and action required to correct the observed deviation,\n- action to be taken with regard to products that have been manufactured during the period when the process was out of control,\n- written record of measures taken.\nCHAPTER III:   VERIFICATION OF OWN-CHECKS SYSTEMS  Own-checks system verification is necessary to ensure that they are working effectively. The multidisciplinary team should specify the methods and procedures to be used.\nUsable methods may include in particular random sampling and analysis, reinforced analysis or tests at selected critical points, intensified analysis of intermediate or final products, surveys on actual condition during storage, distribution and sale  and on actual use of the product.\nVerification procedures may include: inspection of operations, validation of critical limits, review of deviations, corrective action and measures taken with regard to the product, audits of the own-check system and its records.\nVerification should provide for confirmation of the suitability of the own-checks system established and ensure, afterwards, with an appropriate frequency, that the provisions laid down are still being properly applied.\nIn addition, it is necessary to review the system, to ensure that it is (or will be) still valid in case of change.\nExamples of change include:\n- change in raw material or in product, processing conditions (factory layout and environment, process equipment, cleaning and disinfection programme),\n- change in packaging, storage or distribution conditions,\n- change in consumer use,\n- receipt of any information on a new hazard associated with the product.\nWhere necessary, such a review must result in the amendment of the provisions laid down.\nAny change to the own-checks system arising should be fully incorporated into the documentation and record-keeping system in order to ensure that accurate up-to-date information is available.\nWhere criteria are specified in regulations, such criteria are to be used as reference values for the verification process.\n(1) OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 27."}
