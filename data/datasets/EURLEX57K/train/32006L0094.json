In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2) A common transport policy involves inter alia laying down common rules for the international carriage of goods by road to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States. Those rules must be laid down in such a way as to contribute to the smooth operation of the internal transport market.\n(3) It is necessary to ensure a progressive expansion of the international carriage of goods by road, bearing in mind developments in trade and movement of goods within the Community.\n(4) A certain number of types of carriage were exempt from any quota and carriage authorisation system. Within the framework of the organisation of the market introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No\u00a0881/92 of 26\u00a0March 1992 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States\u00a0(5), a system of exemption from Community authorisation and from any other carriage authorisation should be maintained for some of those types of transport, because of their special nature.\n(5) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex\u00a0II, Part B,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the conditions laid down in paragraph\u00a02, Member States shall liberalise the types of international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward and on own account listed in Annex\u00a0I where such carriage is performed to or from or in transit through their territory.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The types of carriage and unladen journeys made in conjunction with the carriage listed in Annex\u00a0I shall be exempted from Community authorisation and from any carriage authorisation.", "This Directive shall not affect the conditions under which any Member State authorises its own nationals to engage in the activities mentioned in this Directive.", "The First Council Directive of 23\u00a0July 1962 on the establishment of common rules for certain types of carriage of goods by road is hereby repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member\u00a0States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex\u00a0II, Part\u00a0B.\nReferences made to the repealed Directive shall be construed as being made to this Directive and should be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex\u00a0III.", "This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Directive is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 12\u00a0December 2006.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
