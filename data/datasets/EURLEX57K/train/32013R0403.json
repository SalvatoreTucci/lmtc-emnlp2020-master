Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) A preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74252) was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004\u00a0(3), on turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005\u00a0(4), and on laying hens and weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1876/2006\u00a0(5). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of that preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) (formerly ATCC 74252), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens and piglets and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use for all poultry species for fattening and laying, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 17 October 2012\u00a0(6) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has a potential to favourably affect animal performance in target species. However, based on the incomplete information provided by the applicant, the Authority was not in a position to specify the minimum enzyme activities. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) As a new authorisation is granted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulations (EC) No 1259/2004, (EC) No 1206/2005 and (EC) No 1876/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Authorisation\nThe preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004\nRegulation (EC) No 1259/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
