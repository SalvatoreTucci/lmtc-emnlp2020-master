It is for the Council to determine, not later than 4 years from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 and at 5-yearly intervals thereafter, whether to put an end to this derogation.\n(3) The institutions of the Union will continue to take steps to improve public access to information in Irish on the activities of the Union. Nevertheless, there are still difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of Irish-language translators, legal/linguistic experts, interpreters and assistants. It is therefore necessary to extend the derogation provided for in the first paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 for a period of 5 years from 1 January 2012,", "main_body": ["The derogation provided for in the first paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 is hereby extended for a period of 5 years from 1 January 2012.\nThis Article shall not apply to Regulations adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ.
