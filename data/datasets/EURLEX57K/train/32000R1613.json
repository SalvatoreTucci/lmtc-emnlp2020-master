Article 76 of that Regulation provides, however, for derogations to those provisions in favour of least-developed GSP-beneficiary countries which submit an appropriate request to that effect to the Community.\n(3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1537/1999(7), Laos obtained such a derogation for certain textiles, for the period from 15 July 1999 to 14 July 2000.\n(4) The request submitted by Laos satisfies the requirements of Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. In particular the introduction of quantitative conditions (on an annual basis) reflecting the Community market's capacity to absorb the Lao products, Laos's export-capacity and actual recorded trade flows, is such as to prevent injury to the corresponding branches of Community industry. The derogation should be adapted, however, with reference to the economic needs.\n(5) In order to encourage regional cooperation among beneficiary countries, it is desirable to provide that the raw materials to be used in Laos in the context of this derogation should originate in countries belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (except Myanmar), to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\n(6) The open and effective administration of these measures should be ensured by applying the relevant provisions, for the management of tariff quotas, laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1427/97(8).\n(7) Any demand to extend application of the derogation beyond the quantities provided for must be considered in consultation with the Lao authorities.\n(8) To be fully effective, the derogation should be granted for a reasonable length of time, that is, until 31 December 2001 when Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 expires.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["1. By way of derogation from Articles 67 to 97 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, products listed in the Annex to this Regulation which are manufactured in Laos from woven fabric (woven items) or yarn (knitted items) imported into that country and originating in a country belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (except Myanmar), to the South Asian Assocation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement shall be regarded as originating in Laos in accordance with the arrangements set out below.\n2.
