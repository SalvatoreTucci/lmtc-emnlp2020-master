Winsl. et al. for a period expiring on 31 March 2003.\n(6) From information supplied by Austria, Ireland and Italy it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zones for those countries in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should exceptionally be extended for a further period to enable the responsible official bodies of those countries to complete the information on the distribution of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. and to complete efforts for the eradication of this harmful organism in the areas concerned.\n(7) From information supplied by Italy it appears that some parts of the region of Veneto, where this harmful organism is now established, should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al.\n(8) Under Directive 2001/32/EC, Sweden is provisionally recognised as a \"protected zone\" in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus for a period expiring on 31 March 2003.\n(9) From information supplied by Sweden, it appears that certain areas in the county of Sk\u00e5ne, where this harmful organism is now established, should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus. The provisional recognition of this protected zone for the rest of Sweden should exceptionally be extended for a further period to enable the responsible official bodies of Sweden to complete the information on the distribution of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus and to complete efforts for the eradication of this harmful organism in other areas concerned.\n(10) Directive 2001/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Directive 2001/32/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
