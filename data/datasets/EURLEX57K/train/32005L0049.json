Accordingly Decision 2004/545/EC designated and made available for automotive short-range radar equipment the 79\u00a0GHz range radio spectrum band on a non-interference and non-protected basis. However, the technology in the 79\u00a0GHz range radio spectrum band is still under development and is not immediately available on a cost-effective basis.\n(4) The time-limited use of the 24\u00a0GHz range radio spectrum band for automotive short-range radars equipment has been permitted by Decision 2005/50/EC. The technology using this frequency band is available in the short-term at a reasonable cost, which will make it possible to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of the deployment of automotive short-range radar equipment as regards road safety. However, the use of radars of that technology has to be limited to avoid interference with other applications that use the 24\u00a0GHz range radio spectrum band.\n(5) Decision 2005/50/EC permits the use of 24\u00a0GHz radar equipment only when originally installed in new vehicles or when replacing one so installed and for a period ending 30 June 2013 at the latest. However, according to Article 5 of Decision 2005/50/EC, that date may be advanced.\n(6) In accordance with Decision 2005/50/EC, Member States have to set up a monitoring system aiming to quantify the number of vehicles equipped with 24\u00a0GHz short-range radars equipment registered in their territory. It is therefore necessary to provide Member States with the appropriate means to carry out this monitoring.\n(7) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The amendments to Directive 72/245/EEC have an impact on Directive 70/156/EEC. It is therefore necessary to amend that directive accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Directive 72/245/EEC\nDirective 72/245/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
