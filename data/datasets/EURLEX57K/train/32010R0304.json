That report includes the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, on the necessity of setting MRLs for that active substance in accordance with Article 12(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and a proposal for such MRLs.\n(2) The Authority examined in particular the risks to consumers and animals. It evaluated the representative use as a post harvest fungicide on citrus and pears and concluded that, based on the available information, a maximum residue level (MRL) of 5\u00a0mg/kg should be set provisionally for the notified use on citrus fruit by drench application. In order to confirm the risk assessment, the Authority requested confirmation that the analytical method applied in the residue trials correctly quantifies the residues of 2-phenylphenol, 2-phenylhydroquinone and their conjugates. In addition, the Authority concluded that the notifier should submit two additional residue trials on citrus fruit and valid storage stability studies. As regards the notified use on pears, the Authority could not propose any MRL because the submitted residue data were not acceptable. In the absence of a specific MRL, the lowest limit of analytical determination should apply.\n(3) The risk assessment carried out by the Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of 2-phenylphenol. It showed that an MRL of 5\u00a0mg/kg for citrus fruit is acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The lifetime exposure assessment via consumption of all food products that may contain 2-phenylphenol showed that there is no risk that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) is exceeded. As an acute reference dose (ARfD) is not necessary for 2-phenylphenol, there was no need to evaluate the short term exposure.\n(4) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the EFSA Scientific report for 2-phenylphenol, including the proposed MRLs. The notifier submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.\n(5) Based on the Scientific Report of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the proposed MRLs fulfil the requirements of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,",
