Grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cVCS 2000\u201d.\n2. The apparatus VCS 2000 is a picture-processing system for automatically determining the trade values of pork-carcass-halves. The system is used online within the slaughtering production system where via a camera system the carcass halves are automatically filmed. The picture data is then processed in a computer by special picture processing software.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcasses shall be calculated on the basis of 38 variables according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = 54,078892\u00a0+\u00a00,037085 * X5\u00a0+\u00a00,256113 * X15\u00a0+\u00a00,021655 * X16\u00a0+\u00a033,97699 * X59 \u2013 0,149103 * X88 \u2013 0,106705 * X90 \u2013 0,0768985 * X91 \u2013 0,079832 * X95 \u2013 0,079042 * X96 \u2013 0,084983 * X97\u00a0+\u00a00,039831 * X107 \u2013 0,681172 * X108\u00a0+\u00a00,234541 * X109 \u2013 0,059871 * X113 \u2013 4,149651 * X120 \u2013 36,8824 * X147 \u2013 19,9219 * X149 \u2013 7,512613 * X156 \u2013 0,086669 * X168 \u2013 0,545069 * X171 \u2013 0,386719 * X173 \u2013 0,025001 * X175 \u2013 1,410422 * X186 \u2013 0,32873 * X192 \u2013 0,260074 * X193 \u2013 0,08137 * X196\u00a0+\u00a0141,2392 * X198 -141\u00a0236 * X199 \u2013 12,7862 * X222 \u2013 27,3973 * X227 \u2013 289\u00a0576 * X228\u00a0+\u00a0425,3549 * X233\u00a0+\u00a014,62961 * X234 \u2013 0,97067 * X242 \u2013 2,084821 * X243 \u2013 3,11945 * X259\u00a0+\u00a014,72706 * X270 \u2013 0,949448 * X273\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcasses\n4. Descriptions of the measurement points and the statistical method can be found in Part II of the Belgian protocol forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\nPART 4\nHENNESSY GRADING PROBE (HGP4)\n1. Grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cHennessy Grading Probe (HGP4)\u201d.\n2. The HGP4 apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade on top of the probe) containing a photodiode and photodetector and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of carcasses shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcasses\nX1 = fat depth (including skin) in millimetres, measured 6 cm off the split line between the third and fourth last rib\nX2 = muscle depth in millimetres, measured 6 cm off the split line between the third and fourth last rib\nPART 5\nOPTISCAN-TP\n1. Grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u201cOptiscan-TP\u201d.\n2. The Optiscan-TP apparatus shall be equipped with a digital imager taking an illuminated photo of the two measurement points on the carcasses. The images are the base for the calculation of fat and muscle thickness according to the two points method \u201cZwei-Punkte Messverfahren (ZP)\u201d. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the Optiscan-TP apparatus itself. The photos are saved and later can be controlled. The integrated Bluetooth\u00ae interface permits easy data transfer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcasses shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcasses\nX1 = smallest fat depth (including skin) over the musculus gluteus medius in millimetres\nX2 = lumbar muscle depth in millimetres, measured as the shortest distance from the front (cranial) end of the musculus gluteus medius to the upper (dorsal) edge of the spinal canal"}
