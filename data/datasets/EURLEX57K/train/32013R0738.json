Additional ingredients are water, spices and authorised additives. Seaweed based fish roe analogues belong to the food category 04.2.4.1 \u2018Fruit and vegetable preparations excluding compote\u2019 according to Part D of the Union List of food additives of the Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(5) As these products are not visually appealing, the use of certain food colours are needed. The use of sweeteners is needed to adjust the taste, to mask bitterness and at the same time to avoid that the use of sugars would limit the microbiological stability and the shelf-life of these products. Additionally requested additives are needed as stabilisers and antioxidants.\n(6) The seaweed based fish analogues are primarily intended to be used as garniture or for ornamentation purposes on dishes, as an alternative to fish roe. The additional exposure due to the use of these additives would therefore be negligible compared to their use in other foodstuffs and is not liable to have an effect on human health. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of certain colours, sweeteners, antioxidants and stabilisers in fish roe analogues.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health.
