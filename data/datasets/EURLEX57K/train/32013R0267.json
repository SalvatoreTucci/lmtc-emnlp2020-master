When the first version of the specification was drawn up the measurement systems used were not as precise as those used today. Thanks to modern GPS systems greater precision has now been possible.\nOil production\nA new production level has been introduced for olive plantations with a density greater than 500 plants per hectare, since the \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 area includes plantations dating from the 1990s which meet the technical criteria of that time and for which the limit of 650\u00a0kg of oil per hectare is a major impediment to the economy and the development of the sector.\nHarvesting and conservation method\nAlongside boxes, crates and waggons may be used to transport the olives, but in this case the olives must be transported to the mill for processing on the day of harvesting and within three (3) days if open boxes are used.\nOil extraction method and constitution of batches\nIt is now possible to use air to clean the olives, as new technological systems developed by manufacturers and already used in other producing countries have been introduced, in order to attach even greater importance to conserving water.\nValidity of the certificate of conformity\nOil complying with the specification may be bottled up to 31 October of the year following that of the olive harvest if it is filtered to clarify it by 31 December and, in any case, at the latest by the application date for certification.\nIf the oil exhibits the chemical and organoleptic characteristics listed in the specifications, and if the conservation conditions are correct, these conditions may differ slightly in terms of quality without, however, jeopardising the criteria of \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 PDO oil. The filtration method has been added, specifying that its aim is to clarify the oil (rather than merely to filter out the solids) and that it must be carried out by 31 December at the latest, with the aim of teaching olive growers conservation techniques which are better suited to marketing a quality product.\nIt has also been specified that the oil\u2019s physical characteristics must be definitive at the time it is sampled, i.e. if the compliant oil is to be bottled, at the latest by 31 October of the year following that of harvesting, and that the clarifying filtration must be carried out by 31 December at the latest, or in any case prior to sampling, if the application in question is received before 31 December.\nThe amendment adds the option of not filtering the oil, so as not to restrict the freedom of the grower, but the oil must be conserved under inert gas so as to best preserve its qualitative characteristics.\n\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other (packaging)\nMetal containers may now be used for formats of less than 3 and 5 litres.\nIndeed, containers of less than 100\u00a0ml have been added, on condition that these are not sold individually but rather placed on the market in packaging with a total volume corresponding to those authorised by the regulations. This amendment stems from the need to meet market demands, i.e. these smaller containers will allow retailers to satisfy the expectations of the gastronomic sector, which prefers not to use already-opened bottles, and to guarantee product promotion by improving its visibility.\nANNEX II\nSINGLE DOCUMENT\nCouncil regulation (EC) No 510/2006\u00a0(1)\n\u2018CHIANTI CLASSICO\u2019\nEC No.: IT-PDO-0205-0977-07.11.2011\nPGI ( ) PDO ( X )\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Chianti Classico\u2019\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State or third country\nItaly\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product\nClass 1.5.

Glass, metal or PET containers of less than 100\u00a0ml are also allowed, provided that their packaging complies with the total capacities authorised by the regulations in force. Containers must be closed hermetically using a device which, upon opening, breaks the guarantee seal.\n\u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 extra virgin olive oil must be put up in the geographical production area so as to better guarantee the product\u2019s proof of origin and avoid deterioration and loss of the product\u2019s specific characteristics, defined in 3.2 above, when it is transported in bulk, in particular the typical bitter and sharp notes of \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 extra virgin olive oil, determined by the phenol antioxidant content and the profile of aromatic substances. Exposure to oxygen in the air when being transferred, pumped, transported and unloaded \u2014 operations carried out more frequently if bottling takes place outside the production area \u2014 could cause the \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 extra virgin olive oil to lose the specific characteristics defined in 3.2 above.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe labelling on containers must bear, in addition to the particulars normally required by law and trade practice, the words \u2018Olio Extravergine di Oliva Chianti Classico\u2019 followed immediately by the words \u2018Denominazione di Origine Protetta\u2019 and show clearly in indelible letters the year of production.\nIt is prohibited to add to the designation any description not expressly provided for in the production specification. However, marks denoting producer groups, names of holdings, estates or farms and place names referring to locations where olives are genuinely grown may be included.\nThe designation must be shown on the label in clear, indelible letters sufficiently intense in colour to contrast sharply with the colour of the label. The graphic characters of any additional wording may not exceed 50\u00a0% of the size of the wording of the designation.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area for \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 oil comprises, in the Provinces of Siena and Florence, the following administrative districts: the whole of Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti, and parts of Barberino Val d\u2019Elsa, Castelnuovo Berardenga, Poggibonsi, San Casciano in Val di Pesa and Tavarnelle Val di Pesa.\nThe area is the same as the production area for \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 wine set out in the Interministerial Decree of 31 July 1932, published in GURI (Italian State Gazette) No 209 of 9 September 1932.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe production area of \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 oil has specific climatic and hydrological characteristics and has been well mapped out since the 14th century.\nThe production area is fairly uniform in terms of terrain and climate; autumns which are on average mild and dry give way to hard winters. The environment as a whole is such that olive trees can be cultivated at the limit of their natural growth zone, which has and indeed continues to influence the olives\u2019 fructification and maturing process.\nAccording to the cultivation techniques which have always been used in this area, the olives are harvested directly from the tree before they are fully mature.\nThe thermal conditions also determine the shape of the trees (normally branching out at the top) adopted by the local growers, which allows the crown to grow so as to better distribute light and heat in the crown, which help the trees develop during short periods of the year.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 extra virgin olive oil is made from varieties traditionally grown in Tuscany and is distinguished by its sensory profile, mainly due to its intense bitter and sharp taste, with fruity aromatic notes.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe chemical and organoleptic characteristics of \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 PDO extra virgin olive oil are linked to the climate of the production area which has a direct influence on the quality and quantity of the phenols, the degree of bitterness and sharpness of the taste and the level of fruitiness.\nIn view of the need to protect the olives from the first autumn frosts, they are traditionally harvested early (i.e. before they are fully mature). Even if this means a lower quantity of oil, it allows the olives to be harvested when their polyphenol content is still high, helping to intensify the bitter and sharp taste so typical of \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 oil. Moreover, thanks to the major variations in temperature normal in this area in autumn, \u2018Chianti Classico\u2019 extra virgin olive oil is also distinguished by a very fruity aroma.\nThe area was given more precise recognition in an edict issued by Duke Cosimo III in 1716 marking out its present boundaries in acknowledgement of the merits and distinctive features of its wine and olive production: a kind of PDO long before the term was invented. A complete theoretical and practical treatise on the olive by G. Tavanti in 1819 listed the main varieties grown in the Chianti Classico region.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006]\nThe consolidated text of the product specification is available on the following website:\nhttp://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3335\nor alternatively:\nby going direct to the home page of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (www.politicheagricole.it) and clicking on \u2018Qualit\u00e0 e sicurezza\u2019 (at the top right of the screen) and then on \u2018Disciplinari di Produzione all\u2019esame dell\u2019UE\u2019.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
