This Article provides for a special timetable for the reduction of customs duties on imports into the Community as originally constituted and Ireland of products of subheading No 76.01 A and of heading No 76.02 or 76.03 of the Common Customs Tariff.\nOwing to the error, the timetable of Article 3 of Protocol No 1 contains only the schedule of tariff reductions based on the basic duties \u2014 as defined in Article 5 (1) of the Agreement \u2014 applied on 1 January 1972 by the Community as originally constituted. The basic duties applied by Ireland on 1 January 1972 being different, the schedule of tariff reductions for Ireland ought to be mentioned separately, as has been done for other products in Article 1 (2) and Article 2 (1) of Protocol No 1.\nThe Irish duty applied on 1 January 1972 to products of subheading No 76.01 A and of certain subheadings of heading Nos 76.02 or 76.03 was zero (Annex). According to Article 3 (1) of the Agreement these duties will remain zero.\nConsequently, it is the understanding of the Community that the timetable of Article 3 should read as follows in respect of those subheadings of heading Nos 76.02 and 76.03 where a positive basic duty on imports into Ireland was in force on 1 January 1972:\nTimetable Community as originally constituted Rates of duty applicable \u2014 percentage ad valorem Ireland Percentage of basic duties applicable\nHeading Nos 76.02 and 76.03 Subheading No 76.01 A Heading Nos 76.02 and 76.03\nOn the date of entry into force of the Agreement 11.4 6.6 95 %\n1 January 1974 10.8 6.3 90 %\n1 January 1975 10.2 5.9 85 %\n1 January 1976 9 5.6 75 %\n1 January 1977 7.2 4.2 60 %\n1 January 1978 3 3 25 %\n1 January 1979 2.7 2.7 22.5 %\n1 January 1980 0 0 0 %\nFurther proof that this form of timetable corresponds to the intention of the negotiators is given in Article 4 (f) of Protocol No 1, which determines the duties that can be reimposed when a ceiling has been reached.
