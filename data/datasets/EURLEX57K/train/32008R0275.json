These provisions have not been adjusted since then.\n(3) Since 1997 the rates of customs duty for goods normally imported by travellers in their personal luggage or sent in small consignments to private individuals have been reduced by about 20\u00a0%. It is therefore appropriate to reduce the standard rate by one percentage point to 2,5\u00a0%. This rate should only be applied to imported goods for which the rate of the Common Customs Tariff is not \u2018free\u2019.\n(4) Given the development of price inflation inside and outside the Community for products normally imported on the said occasions and in view of the increased number of travellers and private consignments it is appropriate to adapt the ceiling to EUR 700 in order to facilitate the customs clearance in these situations.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Annex I, Part One, Section II, to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 shall be amended as follows:\n1. point D.1. shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20181.
