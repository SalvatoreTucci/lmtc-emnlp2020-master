The representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council declare that the additional amounts shall be mentioned in Annex XV of the Accession Treaty without prejudice to the European Parliament's rights and the powers and prerogatives of the budgetary authority conferred by Article 272 of the EC Treaty and the relevant provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure (IIA) in particular points 15, 19 to 21 and 24 thereof and in the negotiations on the future financial perspective.\n2. The European Parliament and the Council agree to adjust the Financial Perspective for 2004, 2005 and 2006 due to enlargement, in accordance with point 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 as proposed by the Commission(1).\n3. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council agree on a revision of the Financial Perspective increasing the ceiling of heading 3, after adjustment under point 25 of the IIA, by EUR 480 million 2004 to 2006, i.e. EUR 50 million for 2004, EUR 190 million for 2005, EUR 240 million for 2006, in accordance with points 19 to 21 of the IIA. The Commission will present the appropriate proposals with a view to adoption before 9 April 2003.\n4. They also agree, as proposed by the Commission, to transfer the financing of the aid to Turkey from heading 4 to heading 7 and to modify the title as follows: \"Pre-accession strategy\". Heading 7 would therefore cover expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania and Turkey as a candidate country(2).\n5. Once adopted, the adjusted ceilings of the Financial Perspective shall apply to all Member States, without any discrimination through subceilings concerning the new Member States.\n6. They also agree to revise (by the end of the budgetary procedure for 2004), in accordance with the codecision procedure, the reference amounts of the codecided programmes within the limits of the ceilings resulting from the abovementioned adjustment and revision of the Financial Perspective.\n7. The preliminary draft budget 2004 to be presented by the Commission will cover all current and acceding States, so that the budgetary procedure can lead to an agreement on all relevant appropriations for the enlarged Union.\n8. In compliance with Article 28 of the draft Accession Treaty, the 2004 budget \"shall be adapted to take into account the accession of the new Member States through an amending budget that shall enter into effect on 1 May 2004.\"\n9.
