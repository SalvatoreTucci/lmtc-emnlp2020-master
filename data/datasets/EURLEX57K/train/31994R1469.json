The following subparagraph is added to Article 4 (a):\n'To be considered as having been harvested, areas must have undergone an operation:\n- carried out after seed formation,\n- aimed at terminating the growing cycle of the plant, and\n- carried out with the aim of valorizing the stalk, with or without seed.\nThe valorization referred to in the third indent shall be considered as having been desired if the plant has been pulled up or if it has been cut by a cutter bar operating, in the case of flax and hemp, at a maximum height of 10 cm and 20 cm  respectively from the ground.\nAs regards the requirement as to the height of the cutter bar:\n- areas must be kept in a state allowing it to be verified during the 20 days following the date of submission of the aid application or the request for checks; by way of derogation from this provision, Member States shall, in respect of the 1994/95  marketing year, take the necessary measures to verify that this requirement is satisfied as soon as harvesting starts,\n- Member States may take special harvest conditions into account.'\n2. Article 8 (2) is replaced by the following:\n'2. Aid applications shall contain:\n- the surname, first name(s) and address of the applicant,\n- a declaration in hectares and ares of the areas harvested, and the cadastral register number of those areas, or a reference recognized as equivalent by the body responsible for checking the areas, stating, in the case of flax, the part relating to  retted, non-deseeded flax and the part relating to flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax, and specifying if it has been pulled up and/or deseeded,\n- details of the place where the product concerned is stored and, where appropriate, in the case of seed, separate details, or, if it has been sold and delivered, the name, first name(s) and address of the purchaser.'\n3. Article 8 (5) is replaced by the following:\n'5. If the checks provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 619/71 show:\n(a) that for hemp and for flax, without distinction between the part under retted non-deseeded flax and the part under flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax, the area in respect of which the aid is applied for differs from that ascertained during  checks, the amount of the aid shall be calculated on the basis of the following area:\n- where the area ascertained is greater than that shown in the aid application, the area ascertained shall be used,\n- where the area ascertained is less than that shown in the aid application, the area to be used shall be that ascertained minus the difference between the two areas. However, the aid application shall be rejected if the difference is more than 25 % of  the ascertained area or if, for the person making the declaration in question, the areas indicated in his declarations or applications have been reduced during the same marketing year or the preceding one in accordance with Article 7 or with this  paragraph.\nWhere the second indent applies to areas under flax, the reduction shall in the first place apply to areas under flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax.\n(b) that an area under retted, non-deseeded flax has been declared in the aid application as an area under flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax, the total amount of the aid to be granted shall, having taken account, where appropriate, of the second  indent of (a), be reduced, in respect of each hectare or part of a hectare of retted, non-deseeded flax declared as flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax, by an amount equal to 15 % of the aid applicable to flax other than retted, non-deseeded flax.\nWhere the inaccurate declarations referred to in (a) and (b) are considered justified by the Member State concerned, no penalty shall be applied.\nThe provisions of this paragraph shall apply without prejudice to any penalties provided for under national law. Member States shall notify the Commission of the measures taken in pursuance of this paragraph.'\n4.
