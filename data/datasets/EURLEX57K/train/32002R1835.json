This measure will enable an overall reduction in the burden on intra-Community operators by concentrating the obligation to provide statistical information at national level and exempting operators in other Member States.\n(5) Member States should have the choice of whether to implement this type of data collection and, if need be, to determine the implementing provisions.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1901/2000 must therefore be amended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Statistics Relating to the Trading of Goods between Member States,", "main_body": ["The first paragraph of Article 47 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2000 is replaced by the following text: \"Those Member States wishing to have more detailed information than that resulting from the application of Article 21 of the basis Regulation may, by way of derogation from that Article, organise the collection of that information.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 October 2002.\nFor the Commission\nPedro Solbes Mira\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 316, 16.11.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 187, 26.7.2000, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1.\n(4) OJ L 149, 6.7.2002, p. 20.\n(5) OJ L 228, 8.9.2000, p. 28.\n(6) OJ L 288, 1.11.2001, p. 30."}
