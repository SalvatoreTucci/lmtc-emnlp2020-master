By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011\u00a0(4) the Commission granted Cape Verde a new derogation from those rules of origin\u00a0(5). That derogation expired on 31 December 2011.\n(2) By letter dated 21 November 2011, Cape Verde submitted a request for a prolongation of that derogation for three years, i.e. from 2012 until 2014. That application concerns a volume of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel.\n(3) Between 2008 and 2011, the total annual derogation quantities that were granted to Cape Verde contributed, to a significant extent, to improving the situation in the Cape Verdean fishery processing sector. Those quantities also led, to a certain extent, to the revitalisation of Cape Verde\u2019s artisanal fleet, which is of vital importance for the country. However, fully revitalising the Cape Verdean fleet to the degree envisaged requires a renewal of the increased available capacity to provide enough originating raw materials to Cape Verde\u2019s fish processing industries.\n(4) The request demonstrates that, without the derogation, the ability of the Cape Verdean fish processing industry to continue to export to the Union would be significantly affected, which might deter further development of the Cape Verdean fleet for small pelagic fishing.\n(5) The derogation should give Cape Verde sufficient time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin. Additional time is needed to consolidate the results already obtained by Cape Verde in its efforts to revitalise its local fishing fleet.\n(6) In order to ensure that the temporary derogation be limited to the time needed for Cape Verde to achieve compliance with the rules, the derogation should be granted for a period of three years, i.e. from 2012 until 2014, in respect of yearly quantities of 2\u00a0500 tonnes for prepared or preserved mackerel fillets and 875 tonnes for prepared or preserved frigate tuna or frigate mackerel.\n(7) In order to ensure continuity of exports from Cape Verde to the Union, the derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 January 2012.\n(8) In the interest of clarity, it is appropriate to set out explicitly that the only non-originating materials to be used for the manufacture of prepared or preserved fillets of mackerel, and prepared or preserved fillets of frigate tuna and frigate mackerel of CN codes 1604\u00a015\u00a011 and ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a097 should be mackerel or frigate tuna or frigate mackerel of HS headings 0302 or 0303, in order for the prepared or preserved fillets of mackerel, frigate tuna and frigate mackerel to benefit from the derogation.\n(9) Since with effect from 1 January 2012 CN code 1604\u00a019\u00a098 was replaced by CN code 1604\u00a019\u00a097, it is appropriate to update the CN codes for the products for which the derogation is granted.\n(10) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Implementing Regulation (EU) No 439/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Articles 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n(a) prepared or preserved fillets of mackerel of CN codes 1604\u00a015\u00a011 and ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a097 produced in Cape Verde from non-originating mackerel of HS headings 0302 or 0303;\n(b) prepared or preserved fillets of frigate tuna or frigate mackerel of CN code ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a097 produced in Cape Verde from non-originating frigate tuna or frigate mackerel of HS headings 0302 or 0303.\n(2) the Annex is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 220, 15.8.2008, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 119, 7.5.2011, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 307, 23.11.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nOrder No CN code Description of goods Periods Quantity\n09.1647 1604\u00a015\u00a011 Prepared or preserved fillets of mackerel (Scomber scombrus, Scomber japonicus, Scomber colias) 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 2\u00a0500\n1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012 2\u00a0500\n1.1.2013 to 31.12.2013 2\u00a0500\n1.1.2014 to 31.12.2014 2\u00a0500\n09.1648 ex\u00a01604\u00a019\u00a097 Prepared or preserved fillets of frigate tuna or frigate mackerel (Auxis thazard, Auxis rochei) 1.1.2011 to 31.12.2011 875\n1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012 875\n1.1.2013 to 31.12.2013 875\n1.1.2014 to 31.12.2014 875\u2019"}
