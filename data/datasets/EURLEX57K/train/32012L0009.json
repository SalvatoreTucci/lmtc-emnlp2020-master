In particular, there is evidence that smoking plays a causal role in mouth and throat cancer, visual impairments as well as dental and gum disease. There is also evidence that parental smoking is a major risk factor for smoking initiation.\n(5) Article 9(2) of Directive 2001/37/EC provides that the Commission shall adapt to scientific and technical progress the health warnings set out in Annex I of the same Directive. Furthermore, guidelines on tobacco packaging and labelling\u00a0(2) adopted by the Third Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in November 2008 recommend that legal measures for packaging and labelling of tobacco products should be reviewed periodically and updated as new evidence emerges and as specific health warnings and messages wear out.\n(6) A revision of the current additional warnings set out in Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC is therefore needed in order to maintain and increase their impact, and to take into account the new scientific developments.\n(7) This revision should be based on the results of the review of existing knowledge on tobacco labelling and the health effects of tobacco use and of testing of the warnings made in all Member States.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee established under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/37/EC and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 28 March 2014 at the latest.
