That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article\u00a07(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(3) The application concerns authorisation of the enzyme preparation 6-phytase (Quantum Phytase) produced by Pichia pastoris (DSM\u00a015927) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, ducks for fattening and piglets (weaned), to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion adopted on 1\u00a0February 2007 and on 30\u00a0January 2008\u00a0(2) that the enzyme preparation 6-phytase (Quantum Phytase) produced by Pichia pastoris (DSM\u00a015927) does not have an adverse effect on animals, consumers, or the environment and that it is efficacious in improving digestibility of feedingstuffs, based on the data provided by the applicant. It further concluded that the product is a mild irritant and a dermal sensitiser and that it may be a potential respiratory sensitiser. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as a digestibility enhancer, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation. Measures should be provided for the protection of users from the risks identified in the opinion of the Authority.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 June 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.
