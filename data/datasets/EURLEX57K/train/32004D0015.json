It would thus appear necessary to provide for the possibility of a Member State to be represented in a third country by another Member State even when it already has representation in that third country, subject to fair distribution between the Member States.\n(3) It is appropriate moreover, for reasons of transparency, to draw up a new Annex to these CCI, concerning a table of representations for issuing uniform visas.\n(4) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. As this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether or not it will transpose it in into its national law.\n(5) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(2), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(3).\n(6) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(4). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(7) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(5). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(8) This Decision constitutes an act building upon the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,", "main_body": ["Point 1.2 of Part II of the Common Consular Instructions shall be amended as follows:\n1. Points (a) to (d) shall be replaced by the following:\n\"(a) If the State responsible has no diplomatic mission or consular post in a given State, the uniform visa may be issued by the mission or post of the State representing the State responsible. The visa is issued on behalf of the State that is being represented, subject to its prior authorisation, and where necessary, to consultation between the central authorities. If one of the Benelux States has a diplomatic mission or consular post, it shall in principle automatically represent the other Benelux States, unless the Benelux State concerned is in practice unable to represent the other Benelux States, in which case the latter may call upon another partner State to represent them on visa matters in the third country in question.\n(b) Even if a State has a diplomatic mission or consular post in a third country, it may ask another State having a consular post in that third country to represent it. The uniform visa is issued on behalf of the State that is being represented, subject to its prior authorisation, and where necessary, to consultation between the central authorities.\n(c) When uniform visas are issued pursuant to (a) and (b), the form of representation shall be agreed between the State or States being represented and the State representing that or those State(s), and shall specify:\n- the duration of such representation and the conditions for its termination;\n- and, for the application of point (b), the arrangements for implementing such representation, including the conditions governing the provision of premises by the representing State or the provision of staff by the representing State and the State being represented, and the possible financial contribution of the State being represented to the costs involved in issuing visas incurred by the representing State.\n(d) When uniform visas are issued pursuant to (a) and (b), the representation shall be reflected in the table of representation for the issuing of uniform visas set out in Annex 18.\"\n2. In point (e), the words \"in non-member countries in which not all Schengen States are represented\" shall be replaced by \"in the event of representation pursuant to (a) and (b).\"\n3.
