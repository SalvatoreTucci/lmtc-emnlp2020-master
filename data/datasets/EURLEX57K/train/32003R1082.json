In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2) It is appropriate to define the minimum level of controls to be carried out in order to ensure proper implementation of the identification and registration system for bovine animals.\n(3) The competent authority of each Member State should carry out controls based on a risk analysis. The risk analysis should take into account all relevant factors, including in particular public and animal health considerations.\n(4) In principle all the animals on a holding should be covered by the controls. However, where for practical reasons it is not possible to assemble the animals on the holding within 48 hours, the competent authority may provide for an appropriate sampling system.\n(5) The competent authority of each Member State should carry out on-the-spot inspections, which should in general be unannounced, as provided for by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(4), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 495/2001(5).\n(6) Member States should make an annual report to the Commission giving details of the implementation of the controls.\n(7) The Commission should provide the Member States with a model of such a report.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,", "main_body": ["The controls provided for in the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals shall at least comply with the minimum requirements set out in Articles 2 to 5.", "1.

The selection of holdings to be inspected by the competent authority shall be made on the basis of risk analysis.\n4.
