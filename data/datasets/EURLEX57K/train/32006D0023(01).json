Accordingly, the adoption of a new ECB decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2004/7 of 22 April 2004 laying down the terms and conditions for transfers of the European Central Bank's capital shares between the national central banks and for the adjustment of the paid-up capital\u00a0(2) with effect from 1 January 2007.\n(2) The Bulgarian National Bank and Banca Na\u0163ional\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei will not join the ESCB until 1 January 2007, which means that transfers of capital shares pursuant to Article 28.5 of the Statute do not apply to them on this occasion.\n(3) Decision ECB/2006/22 of 15 December 2006 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank's capital by the participating national central banks\u00a0(3) determines how and to what extent the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro (hereinafter the participating NCBs) are under an obligation to pay up the ECB's capital in view of the expanded capital key. Decision ECB/2006/26 of 18 December 2006 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank's capital by the non-participating national central banks\u00a0(4) determines the percentage that the NCBs of the Member States that will not have adopted the euro on 1 January 2007 (hereinafter the non-participating NCBs) are under an obligation to pay up with effect from 1 January 2007 in view of the expanded capital key.\n(4) The participating NCBs, with the exception of Banka Slovenije, have already paid up their shares in the ECB's subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2004/6 of 22 April 2004 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank's capital by the participating national central banks\u00a0(5). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2006/22 states that either a participating NCB should transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2006/22.\n(5) Furthermore, Article 2(1) and 2(2) of Decision ECB/2006/30 of 30 December 2006 on Banka Slovenije's paying-up of capital, transfer of foreign reserve assets and contribution to the European Central Bank's reserves and provisions\u00a0(6) lay down that Banka Slovenije, which will be a participating NCB from 1 January 2007, is under an obligation to pay up the remaining share of its subscription to the ECB's capital in order to arrive at the amount shown next to its name in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2006/22, taking into account the expanded capital key.\n(6) Likewise, the non-participating NCBs, with the exception of the Bulgarian National Bank and Banca Na\u0163ional\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei, have already paid up their shares in the ECB's subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2004/10 of 23 April 2004 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank's capital by the non-participating national central banks\u00a0(7). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2006/26 states that each of them should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2006/26. Article 2(2) of Decision ECB/2006/26 states that the Bulgarian National Bank and Banca Na\u0163ional\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei should transfer to the ECB the amount shown next to their names in the table in Article 1 of the same Decision,", "main_body": ["Transfer of capital shares\nGiven the share in the ECB's capital that each NCB, with the exception of the Bulgarian National Bank and Banca Na\u0163ional\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei, will have subscribed on 31 December 2006 and the share in the ECB's capital that each of these NCBs will subscribe with effect from 1 January 2007 as a consequence of the adjustment of the capital key weightings laid down in Article 2 of Decision ECB/2006/21, these NCBs shall transfer capital shares among themselves via transfers to and from the ECB to ensure that the distribution of capital shares with effect from 1 January 2007 corresponds to the adjusted weightings. To this effect, each of these NCBs shall, by virtue of this Article and without any further formality or act being required, either transfer or receive with effect from 1 January 2007 the share in the ECB's subscribed capital shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex I to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to a capital share that the ECB shall transfer to the NCB and \u2018-\u2019 to a capital share that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB.", "Adjustment of the paid-up capital\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the amount of the ECB's capital that each NCB has paid up, if any, and the amount of the ECB's capital that each NCB shall pay up with effect from 1 January 2007 pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2006/22 for the participating NCBs and Article 1 of Decision ECB/2006/26 for the non-participating NCBs respectively, on the first operating day of the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (Target) following 1 January 2007 each NCB shall either transfer or receive the net amount shown next to its name in the fourth column of the table in Annex II to this Decision, whereby \u2018+\u2019 shall refer to an amount that the NCB shall transfer to the ECB and \u2018-\u2019 to an amount that the ECB shall transfer to that NCB.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the first Target operating day following 1 January 2007, the ECB and the NCBs that are under an obligation to transfer an amount under paragraph 1 shall each separately transfer any interest on the respective amounts due accruing over the period from 1 January 2007 until the date of the transfer. The transferors and recipients of this interest shall be the same as the transferors and recipients of the amounts on which the interest accrues.", "General provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The transfers described in Article 2 shall take place through Target.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an NCB does not have access to Target, the amounts described in Article 2 shall be transferred by crediting
