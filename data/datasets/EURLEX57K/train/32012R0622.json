Consultation Forum,\nWhereas:\n(1) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 641/2009 of 22 July 2009 implementing Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for glandless standalone circulators and glandless circulators integrated in products\u00a0(2) requires the Commission to review the methodology for calculating the energy efficiency index, set out in Annex II, point 2, to that Regulation, for glandless circulators integrated in products before 1 January 2012.\n(2) The review carried out by the Commission as well as experience gained with the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 641/2009 revealed the necessity to amend certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 641/2009 in order to avoid unintended impacts on the circulator
