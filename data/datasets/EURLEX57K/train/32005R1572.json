This situation has already resulted in high local prices, causing supply difficulties at competitive prices.\n(3) Germany has significant intervention stocks of rye, outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of.\n(4) The stocks of rye held by the German intervention agency should therefore be made available on the Spanish cereals market as they are particularly suited to the traders\u2019 needs.\n(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.\n(6) It is also important that the German intervention agency\u2019s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.\n(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The German intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the internal Community market of 500\u00a0000 tonnes of rye held by it.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These sales are intended to supply the Spanish market.", "The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.\nHowever, notwithstanding that Regulation:\n(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;\n(b) the minimum selling price shall be fixed at a level that does not disturb the cereals markets.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security shall be set at EUR 10 per tonne.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by the tenderer\u2019s written commitment to lodge a security of EUR 80 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 5 October 2005.\nThe closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Wednesday at 15.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 2 November 2005, 28 December 2005, 12 April 2006, 24 May 2006 and 14 June 2006, there being no invitation to tender in the weeks concerned.\nThe closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial invitation to tender shall be 28 June 2006 at 15.00 (Brussels time).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders must be lodged with the German intervention agency:\nBundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und Ern\u00e4hrung (BLE)\nDeichmannsaue 29\nD-53179 Bonn\nFax 1: (49-228) 6845 3985\nFax 2: (49-228) 6845 3276", "The German intervention agency shall send the Commission the tenders received, no later than two hours after expiry of the time-limit for submitting tenders.
