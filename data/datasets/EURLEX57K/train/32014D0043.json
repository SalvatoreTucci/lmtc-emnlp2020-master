Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC provides for the establishment of an infected area following the confirmation of one or more cases of African swine fever in feral pigs.\n(4) Lithuania has informed the Commission of the current African swine fever situation on its territory, and in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC, it has established an infected area where the measures referred to in Articles 15 and 16 of that Directive are applied.\n(5) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, it is necessary to establish in collaboration with the Member State concerned a Union list of the restricted zones for African swine fever in Lithuania.\n(6) Accordingly, pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, the restricted zones in Lithuania should be listed in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(7) This Decision is to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Lithuania shall ensure that the infected area established in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/60/EC comprises at least the areas listed in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply until 15 February 2014.", "This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 January 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 395, 30.12.1989, p. 13.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever (OJ L 192, 20.7.2002, p. 27).\nANNEX\nInfected area in Lithuania Date until applicable\nThe districts of Trakai and \u0160al\u010dininkai in county (apskritis) Vilnius and the districts of Lazdijai, Var\u0117na, Alytus, Druskininkai in county Alytus. 15 February 2014"}
