Winsl. et al., and for Portugal, Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations), because these organisms now seem to be present in parts of the relevant designated 'protected zone`; whereas also the extent of the protected zones recognized for the United Kingdom in respect of Cephalcia lariciphila (Klug.), Dendroctonus micans Kugelan, Gilpinia hercyniae (Hartig), Gremmeniella abietina (Lag.)
