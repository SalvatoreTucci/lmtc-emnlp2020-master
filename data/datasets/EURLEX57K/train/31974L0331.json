The text of item 5.2.4 of Chapter I.B of the Annex is replaced by the following:\n\"The pointer or the reference mark must be sufficiently thin to permit-certain and easy reading.\nThe test element may have a removable reference mark and be of a size sufficient to permit photo-electric scanning. The reference mark must not conceal the graduation ; if necessary, it may replace the figure 0. It must not interfere with the accuracy of reading.\"\n2. The following is inserted after the table in paragraph 4.3 of Chapter II of the Annex:\n\"The volume of air to be measured may be replaced by the volume which corresponds approximately with a whole number of revolutions of the test element.\"\n3. The text of paragraph 7.26 of Chapter II of the Annex is replaced by the following:\n\"7.2.6. After the endurance test, the meters (with the exception, at most, of one of them if the tests are carried out on a minimum of three meters) must satisfy the following requirements:      (a) over the flow range the difference between the maximum and minimum errors as a function of the flow Q must not exceed a value of 4 % for each meter;\n(b) the error values must not differ by more than 1 75 % of the initial corresponding values;\nFor the Qmin rate this error applies only to variations in the negative sense;\n(c) the mechanical pressure drop must not have increased by more than 20 N/m2 (0 72 millibars).\"\n4. The text of item 8.1 of Chapter II of the Annex is replaced by the following:\n\"8.1. Accuracy tests\nA meter is considered to satisfy the requirements concerning maximum permissible errors if these requirements are met at the following flow rates:      (a) at a flow rate of Qmin;\n(b) at a flow rate of the order of 1/5 Qmax;\n(c) at a flow rate of Qmax.\nIf the examination is conducted under different conditions, the guarantees must be at least equal to those obtained by the tests mentioned above.\"\n5.
