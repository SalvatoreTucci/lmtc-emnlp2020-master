The amount of the  duty imposed was equal to either the amount by which the free-at-Community-frontier-price per  kilogram net, before duty, was less than ECU 2,25 or 20  % of that price per kilogram net,  free-at-Community-frontier, before duty, whichever was higher.\n(2)  Following a review of the measures, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2819/94  (3)  imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium permanganate originating in the  People's Republic of China. The amount of duty imposed was ECU 1,26 per kilogram. The Regulation  entered into force on 20 November 1994.\n(3)  However, Regulation (EC) No 2819/94 does not specifically provide for the repeal or amendment  of Regulation (EEC) No 1531/88, and it is therefore appropriate to make it clear that Regulation  (EEC) No 1531/88 is repealed and is replaced by Regulation (EC) No 2819/94.
