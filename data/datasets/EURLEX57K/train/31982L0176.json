The limit values, the time limits by which they must be complied with and the monitoring procedure for discharges are laid down in Annex I.\n2. The authorizations referred to in Article 3 of Directive 76/464/EEC must contain provisions at least as stringent as those in Annex I to this Directive, except in cases where a Member State is complying with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC on the basis of Annexes II and IV to the present Directive.\nThe authorizations shall be reviewed at least every four years.\n3.

The limit values expressed in terms of concentration which, in principle, should not be exceeded are set out in the following table.\n1.2,3.4 //   //   //   // Unit of measurement  // Monthly average limit values not to be exceeded from 1 July  // Remarks  //  1.2.3.4 //   // 1983  // 1986  //   //   //   //   //  // Recycled brine and lost brine Micrograms of mercury per litre  // 75  // 50  // Applicable to the total quantity of mercury present in all mercury-containing water discharged from the site of the industrial plant  //   //   //   //\nIn all cases, limit values expressed as maximum concentrations may not be greater than those expressed as maximum quantities divided by water requirements per tonne of installed chlorine production capacity.\n2. However, because the concentration of mercury in effluents depends upon the volume of water involved, which is different for different processes and plants, the limit values expressed in terms of quantity of mercury discharged in relation to installed chlorine production capacity given in the following table must be observed in all cases.\n1.2,3.4 //   //   //   // Unit of measurement  // Monthly average limit values not to be exceeded from 1 July  // Remarks  //  1.2.3.4 //   // 1983  // 1986  //   //   //   //   //  // Recycled brine Grams of mercury per tonne of installed chlorine production capacity  // 0;5  // 0;5  // Applicable to the mercury present in effluent discharged from the chlorine production unit  //   // 1;5  // 1;0  // Applicable to the total quantity of mercury present in all mercury-containing water discharged from the site of the industrial plant  //  //   //   //   // Lost brine Grams of mercury per tonne of installed chlorine production capacity  // 8;0  // 5;0  // Applicable to the total quantity of mercury present in all mercury-containing water discharged from the site of the industrial plant  //   //   //   //\n3. The daily average limit values are four times the corresponding monthly average limit values given in points 1 and 2.\n4. In order to check whether the discharges comply with the emission standards which have been fixed in accordance with the limit values laid down in this Annex, a monitoring procedure must be instituted. This procedure must provide for:\n- the taking each day of a sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours and the measurement of the mercury concentration of that sample, and\n- the measurement of the total flow of the discharge over that period.\nThe quantity of mercury discharged during a month must be calculated by adding together the quantities of mercury discharged each day during that month. This total must then be divided by the installed chlorine production capacity. ANNEX II\nQuality objectives\nFor those Member States which apply the exception provided for in Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the emission standards which Member States must establish and ensure are applied, pursuant to Article 5 of that Directive, shall be fixed so that the appropriate quality objective or objectives from among those listed below is or are complied with in the area affected by discharges of mercury from the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry. The competent authority shall determine the area affected in each case and shall select from among the quality objectives listed in paragraph 1 the objective or objectives that it deems appropriate having regard to the intended use of the area affected, taking account of the fact that the purpose of this Directive is to eliminate all pollution.\n1. In order to eliminate pollution as defined in Directive 76/464/EEC, and pursuant to Article 2 of that Directive, the following quality objectives are set:\n1.1. The concentration of mercury in a representative sample of fish flesh chosen as an indicator must not exceed 0;3 mg/kg wet flesh.\n1.2. The total concentration of mercury in inland surface waters affected by discharges must not exceed 1 g/l as the arithmetic mean of the results obtained over a year.\n1.3. The concentration of mercury in solution in estuary waters affected by discharges must not exceed 0;5 g/l as the arithmetic mean of the results obtained over a year.\n1.4. The concentration of mercury in solution in territorial sea waters and internal coastal waters other than estuary waters affected by discharges must not exceed 0;3 mg/l as the arithmetic mean of the resu.lts obtained over a year.\n1.5. The quality of the waters must be sufficient to comply with the requirements of any other Council Directive applicable to such waters as regards the presence of mercury.\n2. The concentration of mercury in sediments or in shellfish must not increase significantly with time.\n3. Where several quality objectives are applied to waters in an area, the quality of the waters must be sufficient to meet each of them.\n4. The numerical values of the quality objectives specified in 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 may, as an exception and where this is necessary for technical reasons, be multiplied by 1;5 until 30 June 1986, provided that the Commission has been notified beforehand.\nANNEX III\nReference method of measurement\n1. The reference method of analysis for determining the mercury content in waters, the flesh of fish, sediments and shellfish is by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry after suitable pre-treatment of the sample which takes account in particular of pre-oxidation of the mercury and of successive reduction of the mercury ions Hg (II).\nThe limits of detection (1) must be such that the mercury concentration can be measured to an accuracy (1) of \u00b1 30 % and a precision (1) of \u00b1 30 % at the following concentrations:\n- in the case of discharges, one tenth of the maximum permitted concentration of mercury specified in the authorization,\n- in the case of surface water, one tenth of the mercury concentration specified in the quality objective,\n- in the case of the flesh of fish and shellfish, one tenth of the mercury concentration specified in the quality objective,\n- in the case of sediments, one tenth of the mercury concentration in the sample or 0;05 mg/kg dry weight, whichever is the greater.\n2. Flow measurement must be carried out to an accuracy of \u00b1 20 %.\nANNEX IV\nMonitoring procedure for quality objectives\n1. For each authorization granted in pursuance of this Directive, the competent authority shall specify the restrictions, the monitoring procedure and deadlines for ensuring compliance with the quality objective or objectives concerned.\n2. In accordance with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the Member State shall report to the Commission for each quality objective chosen and applied, on:\n- the points of discharge and the means of dispersal,\n- the area in which the quality objective is applied,\n- the location of sampling points,\n- the frequency of sampling,\n- the methods of sampling and of measurement,\n- the results obtained.\n3. Samples must be properly representative of the quality of the aquatic environment in the area affected by the discharges, and the frequency of sampling must be sufficient to show any changes in the aquatic environment, taking into account in particular natural variations in the hydrological regime. The salt-water fish analysis must be carried out on a sufficiently representative number of samples and species.\n4. With regard to the quality objective in 1.1 of Annex II, the competent authority shall choose the species of fish to be adopted as indicators for analysis. For salt waters the species chosen from among those inhabiting coastal waters and caught locally may include cod, whiting, plaice, mackerel, haddock and flounder.\nStatement on Article 3 (3)\nThe Council and the Commission state that the application of the best technical means available makes it possible to limit discharges of mercury from the site of a new industrial plant using the recycled-brine process to less than 0;5 g/tonne of installed chlorine production capacity.\n(1) The definitions of these terms are as given in Council Directive 79/869/EEC of 9 October 1979 concerning the methods of measurement and frequencies of sampling and analysis of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States (OJ No L 271, 29. 10. 1979, p. 44)."}
