The mandate requested that the following be taken into account: the stability of free-standing equipment, sharp edges and burrs, tube ends, squeeze, shear, rotating and reciprocating points within the accessible area, weights, equipment access and escape, adjustment and locking mechanisms, ropes, belts and chains, wire ropes and pulleys, rope and belt guides, pull-in points, gripping positions, integral, applied and rotating handgrips, electrical safety and the immobilisation unit for locking the power out.\n(7) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) adopted a series of European standards (EN 957 parts 2 and\u00a04-10) and a European standard EN ISO 20957 (part 1) for stationary training equipment that fall within the scope of the Commission's mandate.\n(8) European standards series EN 957 parts 2 and 4-10 and a European standard EN ISO 20957 (part 1) for stationary training equipment fulfil the mandate M/506 and comply with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC. Their references should accordingly be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(9) On 27 July 2011, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/479/EU on the safety requirements to be met by European standards for gymnastic equipment pursuant to Directive 2001/95/EC\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3).\n(10) On 5 September 2012, the Commission issued standardisation mandate M/507 to the ESOs for developing European standards for gymnastic equipment to address the main risks associated with such equipment, namely risks resulting from insufficient load bearing capacity of the equipment, loss of stability of the equipment, the use of electrical energy and operating circuits, applied mechanical or water energy, use of the equipment itself, including falls, cuts, entrapment, suffocation, collisions and overloading of the body, the accessibility of the equipment, including accessibility in case of defects and emergency situations, possible interactions of the equipment and occasional bystanders (e.g. public audience), insufficient maintenance, the assembly, disassembly and handling of the equipment, and exposure to chemical substances.\n(11) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) adopted ten European standards for gymnastic equipment that fall within the scope of the Commission's mandate.\n(12) These ten European standards for gymnastic equipment fulfil the mandate M/507 and comply with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC. Their references should accordingly be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Directive 2001/95/EC,", "main_body": ["The following European standards meet the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC for the risks they cover:\n(a) EN ISO 20957-1:2013 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 1: General safety requirements and test methods (ISO 20957-1:2013)\u2019,\n(b) EN 957-2:2003 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 2: Strength training equipment, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(c) EN 957-4:2006+A1:2010 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 4: Strength training benches, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(d) EN 957-5:2009 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 5: Stationary exercise bicycles and upper body crank training equipment, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(e) EN 957-6:2010 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 6: Treadmills, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(f) EN 957-7:1998 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 7: Rowing machines, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(g) EN 957-8:1998 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 8: Steppers, stairclimbers and climbers \u2014 Additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(h) EN 957-9:2003 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 9: Elliptical trainers, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(i) EN 957-10:2005 \u2018Stationary training equipment \u2014 Part 10: Exercise bicycles with a fixed wheel or without freewheel, additional specific safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(j) EN 913:2008 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 General safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(k) EN 914:2008 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Parallel bars and combination asymmetric/parallel bars \u2014 Requirements and test methods including safety\u2019,\n(l) EN 915:2008 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Asymmetric bars \u2014 Requirements and test methods including safety\u2019,\n(m) EN 916:2003 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Vaulting boxes \u2014 Requirements and test methods including safety\u2019,\n(n) EN 12196:2003 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Horses and bucks \u2014 Functional and safety requirements, test methods\u2019,\n(o) EN 12197:1997 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Horizontal bars \u2014 Safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(p) EN 12346:1998 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Wall bars, lattice ladders and climbing frames \u2014 Safety requirements and test methods\u2019,\n(q) EN 12432:1998 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Balancing beams \u2014 Functional and safety requirements, test methods\u2019,\n(r) EN 12655:1998 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Hanging rings \u2014 Functional and safety requirements, test methods\u2019,\n(s) EN 13219:2008 \u2018Gymnastic equipment \u2014 Trampolines \u2014 Functional and safety requirements, test methods\u2019.", "The references of standards EN ISO 20957-1:2013, EN 957-2:2003, EN 957-4:2006+A1:2010, EN 957-5:2009, EN\u00a0957-6:2010, EN 957-7:1998, EN 957-8:1998, EN 957-9:2003, EN 957-10:2005, EN 913:2008, EN 914:2008, EN\u00a0915:2008, EN 916:2003, EN 12196:2003, EN 12197:1997, EN 12346:1998, EN 12432:1998, EN 12655:1998 and EN\u00a013219:2008 shall be published in part C of the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 June 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a011, 15.1.2002, p.\u00a04.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0196, 28.7.2011, p.\u00a016.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0197, 29.7.2011, p.\u00a013."}
