whereas the current or likely situation as regards availability of fish in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned does not allow for any  adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved; whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1992 to 1996, in view of the fact that  availability of fish continues to deteriorate;\nWhereas the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme  period between fleet capacity and fish availability;\nWhereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;\nWhereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken under this programme may not warrant public financial  assistance; whereas, in this context, approval of the programme should only be effective where the limitations and conditions upon which such approval was made conditional are complied with;\nWhereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is  most apparent;

GENERAL REMARKS  The programme concerns the whole of the United Kingdom fishing fleet and covers the whole territory of the United Kingdom.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The objectives of the programme should be:\n(a) to reduce the fishing fleet to 189 166 GRT and 1 073 302 kW according to the provisions set out in point II.2;\n(b) to modernize existing vessels where there is no increase in global capacity of the category expressed in gross registered tonnage and engine power.\n2. The evolution of the registered fishing fleet with the exception of:\n- aquaculture working vessels,\n- vessels engaged exclusively in bivalve fishing,\nduring the period covered by the programme should be made within the following limits:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nEqual to or more than 80 feet\n(+ 24,4 m)\n99 908\nLess than 80 feet (+ 24,4 m)\n117 365\nTotal A\n198 997\n206 934\n217 273\n205 543\n198 590\n193 027\n189 166\nVessels for aquaculture and bivalve fishing\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Including the vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\nEngine power  (in kW)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nEqual to or more than 80 feet\n(+ 24,4 m)\n340 566\nLess than 80 feet (+ 24,4 m)\n879 008\nTotal A\n1 117 557\n1 155 212\n1 219 547\n1 149 211\n1 119 208\n1 095 206\n1 073 302\nVessels for aquaculture and bivalve fishing\nTotal B\n(\u00b9) Including the vessels under construction at 1 January 1987.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. While the objectives in point II.2, Total A fix a reduction in the fishing fleet capacity equal to the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the objectives to be achieved by 31 December 1992, it is also  necessary to take into account the balance of capacity, if any, resulting from:\n- those projects for new construction having benefited from Community and national aids at the 1991 tranches,\n- those projects for new vessel construction presently under examination by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- the balance of exists and entries from the fleet carried out during 1992 and not taken into account in the preceding lines,\nwhich additions give the total reduction in fishing fleet capacity required.\n1.2. The reductions envisaged in point III.1.1, should be achieved by implementing the following actions in so far as the entry into service of surplus fishing capacity having been incorporated in the capacity limits of this programme and being intended  that the reductions envisaged for each of the actions can be varied on condition that the total volume of reduction of fishing capacity set out in point III.1.1 is respected:\n- a reduction in the total fleet, by renewal of those active vessels lost by accident at sea, sinking or otherwise by linking direct withdrawals to new construction in line with the achievement of the objectives for fleet capacity envisaged in point  II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of direct measures intended to adapt fishing capacity,\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results.\n2. Adoption and implementation of comprehensive legislation and/or administrative measures in order to control effectively the active fishing capacity and fishing operations and consequently to achieve the objectives of the programme set out in point  II.2.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels in order to effectively control fishing capacity.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (\u00b2) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) The withdrawal of requests for financing of projects currently being examined by the Commission will allow for adjustment of the total reduction required.\n(\u00b2) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 91."}
