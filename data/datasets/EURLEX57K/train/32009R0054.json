The new tariff quotas are to apply from 1 September 2008. In order to implement these new tariff quotas, it is necessary to adjust the list of fish and fishery products subject to tariff quotas laid down in Regulation (EC) No 669/97.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3) provides for a system of management for tariff quotas, designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of acceptance of the customs declarations. For reasons of simplification and to ensure efficient management carried out in close cooperation between the authorities of the Faroe Islands, the customs authorities of the Member States and the Commission, that management system should apply to the tariff quotas provided for in Regulation (EC) No 669/97.\n(4) For the year 2008, the volumes of the tariff quotas provided for in this Regulation should be calculated as a pro rata of the basic volumes set out in Decision No 2/2008 (2008/957/EC), in proportion to the part of the year which has elapsed before the tariff quotas apply.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 669/97 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) In accordance with Decision No 2/2008 (2008/957/EC), the new tariff quotas are to apply from 1\u00a0September 2008. This Regulation should therefore apply from the same date.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 669/97 is amended as follows:\n1.
