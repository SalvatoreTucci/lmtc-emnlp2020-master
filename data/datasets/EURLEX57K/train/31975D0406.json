(3)OJ No L 116, 1.5.1973, p. 1.\nANNEX ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME CONCERNING THE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE (INDIRECT ACTION)\nAn upper limit of 19 716 million units of account shall be allocated to this programme and the number of staff shall be four.\nThe aim of the programme shall be the joint development and perfecting of a system of management of radioactive waste produced by the nuclear industry which, at its various stages, affords man and his environment the best protection possible.\nIn order that the Commission may submit suitable proposals at the earliest opportunity, the programme shall seek to promote:    A. Work to solve certain technological problems posed by the processing, storage and disposal of radioactive waste.\nProcessing:      - medium activity solid waste : coating with plastic resins;\n- high-activity solid waste : decontamination and conditioning of irradiated fuel element cladding;\n- high-activity solid waste : immobilization of calcined waste from fission products in a metal matrix;\n- plutonium-contaminated solid waste : incineration process;\n- comparative study of the properties of various materials suitable for the immobilization of high-activity waste.\nStorage and disposal:      - storage of solidified radioactive waste in engineered structures;\n- disposal of radioactive waste in suitable geological formations, including those formations currently being studied;\n- storage of gaseous waste.\nStudy of an advanced management model:    - separation and recycling of long-life waste (actinides).\nB. Work contributing towards the definition of a general framework (legal, administrative, financial) for the implementation of radioactive waste storage and disposal measures:      - review of problems posed by the management of radioactive waste which could not be solved under existing international legal, administrative and financial provisions and proposals for solutions;\n- study of principles which should govern the management of radioactive waste.\nThe work described in A and B will in the main be carried out by means of contracts."}
