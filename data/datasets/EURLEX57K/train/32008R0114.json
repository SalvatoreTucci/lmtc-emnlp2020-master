This rule is laid down for programmes not approved by 31 March 2007.\n(2) Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 provides that the Community\u2019s budget commitments for rural development programmes are to be made in annual instalments and that for each programme, the budget commitment for the first instalment is to follow the adoption of the programme by the Commission.\n(3) Under the second subparagraph of Article 9(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(3), appropriations which have not been used at the end of the financial year may be carried over, to the following financial year only, by means of a decision taken by the Commission by 15 February at the latest.\n(4) Given this framework and the appropriations available for 2007, a large number of programmes will not be able to be approved until after the appropriations not used in that financial year have been carried over. As a result, for 2007, the first year of the programming period, it will not be possible for some of the payments made in anticipation by the Member States to be covered by a declaration of expenditure by the deadline of 31 January 2008 laid down in Article 16(2)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006.\n(5) Therefore, in order to facilitate the financial management of the rural development programmes and in order not to prolong the deadline for reimbursing the expenditure incurred by the Member States, a new deadline should be laid down to enable the Member States, by derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, to make an additional, special declaration of expenditure for the payments in anticipation made by them in 2007 under programmes approved by the Commission between the date of the Commission decision on the carry-over of appropriations from 2007 and 29 February 2008.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["The third subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u2018However, if a rural development programme has not been approved by the Commission by 31 March 2007, all the expenditure carried out in anticipation by the paying agency under its own responsibility, during the periods preceding the adoption of this programme, shall be declared to the Commission in the first declaration of expenditure following the adoption of the programme.
