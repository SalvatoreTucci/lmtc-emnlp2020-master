That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) for ornamental use should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled.\n(5) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.\n(6) The opinion adopted on 12 March 2008 (published 26 March 2008)\u00a0(2) by the European Food Safety Authority (hereafter EFSA), concluded, from all evidence provided, that cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) are unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use. EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the notifier is in line with the intended use of the carnation.\n(7) An examination of the full notification, additional information provided by the notifier, specific objections raised by the Member States and the opinion of EFSA, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use.\n(8) A unique identifier has been assigned to the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC\u00a0(3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms\u00a0(4).\n(9) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended use with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.\n(10) Proposed labelling, on a label or in an accompanying document, should include wording to inform operators and final users that the cut flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12 can not be used for human or animal consumption nor for cultivation.\n(11) A detection method as required by Annex III B.D.12 to Directive 2001/18/EC, was verified, tested and single-laboratory validated for the Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12 in January 2008 by the Community Reference Laboratory established by Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5).\n(12) The Committee under Directive 2001/18/EC did not deliver an opinion on the draft measures submitted by the Commission. The Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC, the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them, in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(6), the measures should be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Consent\nWritten consent shall be granted by the competent authority of the Netherlands to the placing on the market, in accordance with this Decision, of the product identified in Article 2, as notified by Florigene Ltd, Melbourne, Australia (Reference C/NL/06/01).\nThe consent shall, in accordance with Article 19(3) of Directive 2001/18/EC, explicitly specify the conditions to which the consent is subject, which are set out in Articles 3 and 4.", "Product\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The genetically modified organisms to be placed on the market as product, hereinafter \u2018the product\u2019, are cut flowers of carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.), with modified flower colour, derived from the Dianthus caryophyllus L. cell culture, and transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, strain AGL0, using the vector pCGP1991 and resulting in line 123.8.12.\nThe product contains the following DNA in three cassettes:\n(a) Cassette 1\n(b) Cassette 2\n(c) Cassette 3\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consent shall cover progeny derived through vegetative reproduction of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12).", "Conditions for placing on the market\nThe product may be put to ornamental use only and cultivation is not allowed.
