GENERAL REMARKS\nThe programme relates to all Danish vessels. Vessels of a tonnage below 5 GRT may not receive any State aid. The programme covers the entire territory of Denmark, excluding the Faroes and Greenland.\nII. OBJECTIVES\n1. The objectives of the programme shall be:\n(a) to reduce the overall fleet to 119 188 GRT and to 514 716 kW, according to the provisions set out in II. 2;\n(b) the maintainence of a regional balance between the various categories of the fleet;\n(c) the introduction of better measures to support and monitor the development of the fleet;\n(d) to modernize existing vessels that are less than 25 years old where there is no increase in global capacity on the category; expressed in gross registered tons and engine power, and with the exception of boats envisaged in IV. 2 below.\n2. The evolution of the active fishing fleet with the exception of:\n- aquaculture working vessels,\n- vessels engaged exclusively in bivalve fishing,\n- vessels engaged exclusively for transport and which have been considered as fishing vessels by National legislation,\n- vessels less than five tons,\nduring the period covered by the programme should be made within the following limits:\nTonnage\n(GRT)\n1.2.3.4,6 //  //  //  //  // Type  // Objective of programme (Regulation (EEC) No 2908/83)   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987 (1)  // Objective at 1.2.3.4.5.6 //  //  //  // 31. 12. 1989  // 31. 12. 1990  // 31. 12. 1991   //    //   //   //   //  //   // 1.

PLANNED MEASURES\n1.1. While the objectives at point II 2 \"Total A\" fix a reduction in the fishing capacity equal to the difference between the situation at 1 January 1987 and the objective to be achieved by 31 December 1991 it is also necessary to take into account the balance of capacity resulting from:\n- those projects for new construction having benefited from Community and national aids at the 1987 tranche,\n- those projects for new vessel construction presently under examination by the Commission (1),\n- the balance of exits from and entries to the fleet carried out between 1 January 1987 and 30 June 1988 and not taken into account in the preceding lines;\nwhich additions give the total reduction in the fishing fleet capacity required.\n1.2. The reductions envisaged in point III. 1.1 should be achieved by implementing the following actions in so far as the entry into service of surplus fishing capacity having been incorporated in the capacity limits of this programme and being intended that the reductions envisaged for each of the actions can be varied on condition that the total volume of reduction of fishing capacity is respected:\n- a reduction in the total fleet, by renewal of those active vessels lost by accident at sea, sinking or otherwise of that part of the fleet that will contribute to a reduction towards the achievement of the objectives for fleet capacity envisaged in II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures intended to adapt fishing capacity by permanently withdrawing such vessels that will contribute for the achievement of a balanced fleet in accordance with the objectives of the programme,\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results and improve planning and control of fishing operations.\n2. Adoption and implementation of comprehensive legislation and or administrative measures in order to control effectively the active fishing capacity and fishing operations and consequently to achieve the objectives of the programme set out in II.2.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels in order to effectively control fishing capacity.\nIV. COMMENTS\n1. The objectives of the fleet given in II. 1 (a) can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. In the case of fishing vessels operating in the coastal zone and smaller than 12 metres, a limited increase of 10 % in tonnage and of 6 % in power can be taken into consideration in order to improve safety, working conditions and preservation of catch on board on condition that these increases are fully justified and that the objectives for the vessel category to which these vessels belong and which are fixed in II. 2 of this Decision are respected. Any such increase, if the case arises, can only take place in equilibrium with the resources which may be exploited by these vessels.\n3. The objectives of the programme should be realized up to the 20 % level at least by the end of 1988 and to the 80 % level at least by the end of 1990.\n4. The Commission recalls that all aids sanctioned by Denmark on the fisheries sector and including shipyards for the construction of fishing vessels should be included within the framework of the present programme.'\n(1) The withdrawal of requests for financing of projects currently being examined by the Commission will allow adjustment of balance of the total reduction required."}
