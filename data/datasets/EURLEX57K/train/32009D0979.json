In addition, Article 37(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC provides that the Member State concerned shall submit to the Commission a national programme, accompanied by all the appropriate financial information, designed to improve its control system.\n(3) The functioning of the internal market requires a harmonised control system for live animals including those being exported to third countries. It is appropriate to facilitate the implementation of that strategy by providing for a Union financial contribution towards the implementation of this strategy.\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 of 9 April 2003 laying down detailed rules pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards requirements for the granting of export refunds related to the welfare of live bovine animals during transport\u00a0(4) provides that the exit of the animals from the customs territory of the Union may take place through an exit point where the official veterinarian shall verify for those animals for which an export declaration is accepted whether the requirements laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97\u00a0(5) have been complied with from the place of departure until the exit point and that the transport conditions for the rest of the journey comply with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 provides that where animals are presented at exit points, official veterinarians of the Member States shall check that the animals are transported in compliance with this Regulation. Where the competent authority considers that animals are not fit to complete their journey, they shall be unloaded, watered, fed and rested in a control post.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 of 25 June 1997 concerning Community criteria for control posts and amending the route plan referred to in the Annex to Directive 91/628/EEC\u00a0(6) lays down the criteria applicable throughout the Community to be met by control posts so as to ensure the optimum welfare conditions for the animals passing through them and also to provide for certain incidental animal health matters.\n(7) Bulgaria has experienced staffing and infrastructure problems at the exit point of Bourgas port in implementing the veterinary checks, required within the Community by Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 639/2003, on live bovine animals exported via this port. In particular, there are neither facilities for official veterinarians to inspect live bovine animals nor an approved control post in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 in the immediate vicinity of the port where the animals can be unloaded, watered, fed and rested if they are unfit to pursue their journey or if they cannot be transported within the journey times laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1/2005.\n(8) On 17 September 2009, Bulgaria submitted to the Commission a programme for controlling and monitoring transport conditions of live bovine animals exported from the Union via Bourgas port for 2010 for which Bulgaria wishes to receive a financial contribution from the Union.\n(9) The Commission has assessed the programme submitted by Bulgaria for 2010 from both the veterinary and the financial point of view.
