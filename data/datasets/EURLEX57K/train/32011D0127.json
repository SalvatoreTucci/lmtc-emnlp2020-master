Decision 2007/697/EC expires on 17 July 2010.\n(4) On 12 May 2010 Ireland submitted to the Commission a request for an extension of the derogation. The request contained a justification on the basis of the objective criteria specified in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC.\n(5) Ireland has adopted a new action programme for the period July 2010 to December 2013, which mainly maintains the measures of the action programme for the period until 30 June 2010 and applies to the whole territory of Ireland.\n(6) The fourth report on implementation of Directive 91/676/EEC in Ireland for the period 2004-2007 shows in general stable or improving water quality. For groundwater, 2\u00a0% of sites showed average nitrate values above 50\u00a0mg/l and 74\u00a0% of sites values below 25\u00a0mg/l. For surface river waters, 97\u00a0% of monitoring sites showed average nitrate values below 25\u00a0mg/l, and no sites showed average values above 50\u00a0mg/l. 93\u00a0% of lakes were classified as either oligotrophic or mesotrophic and 7\u00a0% of lakes were classified as eutrophic or hypertrophic.\n(7) Livestock numbers decreased further during the period 2004-2007, by about 4\u00a0% for cattle, 19\u00a0% for sheep, 4\u00a0% for pigs and 7\u00a0% for poultry\u00a0(3). The annual use of organic nitrogen from livestock manure and of mineral nitrogen decreased by 5\u00a0% and 17\u00a0% respectively. The total farmed area decreased by 3\u00a0% to 4,28 million hectares and grassland still accounts for over 90\u00a0% of the agricultural area.\n(8) In the light of the scientific information referred to in the request for extension of the derogation and the measures which Ireland has committed itself to in the action programme for the period July 2010 to December 2013, it can be concluded that the conditions for obtaining the derogation as specified in Directive 91/676/EEC, such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake, are still fulfilled, and that the derogation does not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of that Directive.\n(9) For the purpose of ensuring that the grassland farms concerned may continue to benefit from a derogation, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of Decision 2007/697/EC to 31 December 2013.\n(10) The deadlines for reporting to the Commission set out in Decision 2007/697/EC should however be adapted in order to simplify the administrative burden by allowing Ireland to establish only one deadline for all reporting obligations.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["Decision 2007/697/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
