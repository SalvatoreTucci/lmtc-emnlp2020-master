It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.\n(2) The SCCP further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.\n(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products, according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.\n(4) Substances for which updated safety files were submitted are currently being evaluated by the SCCP. For 17 hair dye substances final opinions have already been given by the SCCP. Therefore, definitive regulation of these hair dye substances, on the basis of such evaluations, can take place.\n(5) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 15 November 2009 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
