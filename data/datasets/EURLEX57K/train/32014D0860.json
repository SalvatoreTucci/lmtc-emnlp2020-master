This will also allow for time to prepare for a transition of its coordination and planning functions and resources to the EEAS/CSDP structures on a permanent basis, in the context of the EEAS review process to be led by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR), with due regard to the institutional framework and applicable procedures. There would be no need for further mandate extension after such a transition. Any future new entity within the EEAS/CSDP structures undertaking coordination and planning support functions would therefore have a different name reflecting this role. In the interim, the EU Operations Centre should expand its civil/military coordination and planning support role, and assume enhanced geographical responsibility for the Sahel region, within the established resource and staffing ceiling. Any geographical expansion beyond the Sahel region would require a separate Political and Security Committee (PSC) agreement.\n(3) Decision 2012/173/CFSP should therefore be amended and extended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 2012/173/CFSP is amended as follows:\n(1) The title is replaced by the following:\n(2) In Article 1, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n(3) Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n(a) provide direct support to the Civilian Operations Commander for the operational planning and conduct of the civilian missions in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel region, using its military and specialised planning expertise;\n(b) provide support to the military Missions and Operation Commanders in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel region;\n(c) provide support to the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD), at its request, in its strategic planning for the CSDP missions and operation in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel region;\n(d) facilitate interaction between the respective CSDP missions and operation and the Brussels-based structures.
