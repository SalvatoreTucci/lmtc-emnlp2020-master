In the light of the verifications made some of the accounts do not fulfil this condition and therefore part of the expenditure concerned cannot be recognised as chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Annex I lists the amounts cleared by Member State. The details of these amounts have been described in the Summary Report that has been presented to the Fund Committee at the same time as the present Decision.\n(7) In the light of the verifications made, the information submitted by certain other paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be cleared in this decision. Annex II lists the paying agencies concerned.\n(8) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, in liaison with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 on budgetary discipline(8) lays down that advances against booking are to be reduced for expenditure effected by the Member States after the limits or deadlines laid down. However, pursuant to Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, any overrun of deadlines during August, September and October are to be taken into account in the accounts clearance decision except where noted before the last decision of the financial year relating to advances; part of the expenditure claimed by certain Member States during the abovementioned period and for the measures for which the Commission did not accept any extenuating circumstances was effected after the limits or deadlines laid down. This Decision should therefore lay down the relevant reductions. A decision will be taken at a later date, in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, definitively fixing the expenditure for which Community financing will not be granted regarding those reductions and any other expenditure which may be found to have been effected after the limits or deadlines laid down.\n(9) The Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 and Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, reduced or suspended a number of monthly advances on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2001 financial year and proceeds in this Decision to the reductions laid down in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96. In the light of the above, to avoid any premature or even only temporary reimbursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision, without prejudice to further examination according to Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.\n(10) The second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, lays down that the amounts that, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph, are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2001, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with the first subparagraph. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken. Annex I lists the amounts cleared for each Member State.\n(11) In accordance with the final subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, this Decision, adopted on the basis of accounting information, does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules,", "main_body": ["With the exception of the paying agencies referred to in Article 2 the accounts of the paying agencies of the Member States concerning expenditure financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section in respect of the 2001 financial year are hereby cleared.
