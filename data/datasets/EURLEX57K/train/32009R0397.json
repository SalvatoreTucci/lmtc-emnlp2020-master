Such support for energy efficiency and renewable energy investment in the housing sector should be made available for all Member States.\n(3) Support should be provided to those investments which take place in the framework of public schemes in line with the objectives of the Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5\u00a0April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services\u00a0(4).\n(4) In order to ensure that the objectives of the cohesion policy as set out in Article\u00a0158 of the Treaty are met, interventions should support social cohesion.\n(5) The European Court of Auditors recommended in its 2007 annual report that the legislative authorities and the Commission be prepared to reconsider the design of future expenditure programmes by giving due consideration to simplifying the basis of calculation of eligible costs and making greater use of lump-sum or flat-rate payments instead of reimbursement of \u2018real costs\u2019.\n(6) In order to ensure the necessary simplification in the management, administration and control of operations that receive an ERDF grant, particularly when linked to a result-based reimbursement system, it is appropriate to add three additional forms of eligible costs, namely, indirect costs, lump sums and flat-rate standard scales of unit cost.\n(7) In order to ensure legal certainty in relation to the eligibility of expenditure, these additional forms of eligible costs should be applicable to all grants from the ERDF. Retroactive application should therefore be necessary with effect from 1\u00a0August 2006, which is the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01080/2006.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01080/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Article\u00a07 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01080/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following paragraph shall be inserted:\n2. the introductory phrase of paragraph\u00a02 shall be replaced by the following:\n3. the following paragraph shall be added:\n(i) indirect costs, declared on a flat-rate basis, of up to\u00a020\u00a0% of the direct costs of an operation;\n(ii) flat-rate costs calculated by application of standard scales of unit cost as defined by the Member State;\n(iii) lump sums to cover all or part of the costs of an operation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever, Article\u00a01(3) shall apply with effect from 1\u00a0August 2006.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 6\u00a0May 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.
