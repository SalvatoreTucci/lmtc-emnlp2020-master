As from 4 June until 21 June 1985 applications for private storage aid in the pigmeat sector may be made to the Belgian intervention agency in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80 and of this Regulation.\nOnly products coming from pigs reared and slaughtered in the infection zone can be eligible for the aid. The list of products which qualify for aid and the relevant amounts are set out in the Annex hereto.\n2. If the period of storage is extended or curtailed, the amount of aid shall be adjusted accordingly. The amounts of the supplements and the deductions per month and per day are set out colums 7 and 8 of the Annex.", "The minimum quantities per contract and per product shall be as follows:\n(a) 10 tonnes for carcases and half carcases;\n(b) 5 tonnes for all the other products.", "By way of derogation from Article 3 (1) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80 placing in storage must be carried out within 14 days of the date of conclusion of the contract.", "The storage contract must impose, in addition to the obligations specified in Article 3 (2) (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80, an obligation to indicate on each batch placed in storage the name or names of the producer(s) who supplied the pigs the meat of which is covered by the contract.", "By way of derogation from Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80, the security shall be 100 % of the amounts of aid set out in the Annex.", "By way of derogation from Article 6 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80, the intervention agency, shall, on application by the party concerned, make an advance payment of 80 % of the aid once the products have been placed in storage in accordance with the storage contract.", "1. Where following a decision by the national health authorities, meat cannot be released for consumption until it has undergone sufficient heat treatment to prevent any further spread of the epizootic or where it must be destroyed because of the risk of the latter, the Belgian intervention agency shall, at the request of the party concerned, buy in the products offered to it.\nIn such cases the buying-in price for carcases shall be the grade II market price in Belgium within the meaning of Council Regulations (EEC) No 2760/75 and (EEC) No 43/81 recorded during the week in which the contract was concluded, plus 10 %. In the case of other products, the buying-in price shall be determined on the basis of the carcase price, using the coefficients referred to in Article 10 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 expected for bellies without rind and cuts corresponding to 'middles' (ex 02.01 A III a) 6) for which the coefficient is fixed at 1,12. However, the buying-in price shall be reduced by an amount corresponding to 30 % of the final amount of aid granted to the storer.\n2. Where buying in takes place, the period covered by the storage contract shall expire on the day which precedes buying in.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 June 1985.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 307, 18. 11. 1980, p. 5.\n(3) OJ No L 75, 16. 3. 1985, p. 12.\n(4) OJ No L 86, 27. 3. 1985, p. 20.\n(5) OJ No L 96, 3. 4. 1985, p. 17.\n(6) OJ No L 105, 17. 4. 1985, p. 6.\n(7) OJ No L 114, 27. 4. 1985, p. 36.\n(8) OJ No L 114, 3. 5. 1980, p. 22.\n(9) OJ No L 23, 26. 1. 1985, p. 19.\n(10) OJ No L 3, 1. 1. 1981, p. 15.\n(11) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 10.\nANNEX\n(ECU/tonne)\n1.2.3,6.7,8 //   //   //   //   // CCT heading No  // Products in respect of which aid is granted  // Amount of the aid for a storage period of  // Supplement or deduction  //   //   //   //  1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8 //   //   // 4 months  // 5 months  // 6 months  // 7 months  // per month  // per day  //  //   //   //   //   //   //   //   // 1  // 2  // 3  // 4  // 5  // 6  // 7  // 8  //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //  // ex 02.01 A III a) 1  // Whole carcases or half carcases without the head, flare fat, kidneys, forefeet, tail, diaphragm and spinal cord, fresh or chilled (1)  // 522  // 553  // 584  // 615  // 31  // 1,03  // ex 02.01 A III a) 2  // Legs, fresh or chilled  // 628  // 663  // 698  // 733  // 35  // 1,17  // ex 02.01 A III a) 3  // Fore-ends or shoulders, fresh or chilled  // 628  // 663  // 698  // 733  // 35  // 1,17  // ex 02.01 A III a) 4  // Loins, with or without collar, collars, fresh or chilled (2)  // 628  // 663  // 698  // 733  // 35  // 1,17  // ex 02.01 A III a) 5  // Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut, fresh or chilled  // 326  // 353  // 380  // 407  // 27  // 0,90  // ex 02.01 A III a) 6 aa)  // Bellies, whole or trimmed by rectangular cut, without rind and ribs, fresh or chilled  // 326  // 353  // 380  // 407  // 27  // 0,90  // ex 02.01 A III a) 6  // Cuts corresponding to 'middles', with or without rind, fat or bones, fresh or chilled (3)  // 480  // 509  // 538  // 567  // 29  // 0,97  // ex 02.01 A III a) 6 aa)  // Legs, fore-ends, shoulders, loins with or without collar or collars, boned, fresh or chilled (4)  // 628  // 663  // 698  // 733  // 35  // 1,17  //   //   //   //   //   //   //   //\n(1) The aid for products falling within subheading ex 02.01 A III a) 1 can also be granted for half carcases presented as Wiltshire sides, i.e. without the head, feet, tail, flare fat, kidneys, tenderloin, bone blade, sternum, vertebral column, pelvic bone and diaphragm.\n(2) Loins falling within subheading ex 02.01 A III a) 4 may be with or without rind, the adherent layer of fat, however, not exceeding 25 mm in depth.\n(3) Same presentation as for products falling within subheading 02.06 B I a) 2.\n(4) Loins and collars falling within subheading ex 02.01 A III a) 6 aa) may be with or without rind, the adherent layer of fat, however, not exceeding 25 mm in depth.
