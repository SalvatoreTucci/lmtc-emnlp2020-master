 whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1992 to 1996, in view of the fact that availability of certain species continues to deteriorate;\nWhereas the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies an improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme period between  fleet capacity and fish availability;\nWhereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;\nWhereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy;

GENERAL REMARKS  The programme relates to all Danish vessels. Vessels of a tonnage below 5 GRT may not recieve any State aid. The programme covers the entire territory of Denmark, excluding the Faroes and Greenland.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The objectives of the programme shall be:\n(a) to reduce the overall fleet to 116 804 GRT and to 504 422 kW, according to the provisions set out in point II.2;\n(b) the maintainence of a regional balance between the various categories of the fleet;\n(c) the introduction of better measures to support and monitor the development of the fleet;\n(d) to modernize existing vessels that are less than 25 years old where there is no increase in global capacity in the category expressed in gross registered tonnes and engine power.\n2. The evolution of the active fishing fleet with the exception of:\n- aquaculture working vessels,\n- vessels engaged exclusively in bivalve fishing,\n- vessels engaged exclusively in transport and which have been considered as fishing vessels by national legislation,\n- vessels less than five tonnes,\nduring the period covered by the programme should be made within the following limtis:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\n1.

PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. While the objectives in point II.2, Total A fix a reduction in the fishing fleet capacity equal to the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the objectives to be achieved by 31 December 1992, it is also  necessary to take into account the balance of capacity, if any, resulting from:\n- the balance of exits and entries from the fleet carried out during 1992 and not taken into account in the preceding lines,\nwhich additions give the total reduction in fishing fleet capacity required.\n1.2. The reductions envisaged in point III.1.1 should be achieved by implementing the following actions in so far as the entry into service of surplus fishing capacity having been incorporated in the capacity limits of this programme and being intended  that the reductions envisaged for each of the actions can be varied on condition that the total volume of reduction of fishing capacity is respected:\n- a reduction in the total fleet, by renewal of those active vessels lost by accident at sea, sinking or otherwise of that part of the fleet that will contribute to a reduction towards the achievement of the objectives for fleet capacity envisaged in  point II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures intended to adapt fishing capacity by permanently withdrawing such vessels that will contribute to the achievement of a balanced fleet in accordance with the objectives of the programme,\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results and improve planning and control of fishing operations.\n2. Adoption and implementation of comprehensive legislation and/or administrative measures in order to control effectively the active fishing capacity and fishing operations and consequently to achieve the objectives of the programme set out in point  II.2.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels in order to effectively control fishing capacity.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (\u00b9) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 1991."}
