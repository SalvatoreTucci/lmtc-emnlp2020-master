No 2 is amended as follows:\n- in the column 'Name`, the word 'Cashgora` is inserted after 'guanaco`,\n- in the column 'Fibre description`, the words 'cashgora goat` (a cross between the kashmir goat and the angora goat) are added after the word 'guanaco`.\n2. No 30 is amended as follows:\n- the text in the column 'Name` reads 'Polyamide or nylon`,\n- the description of the fibres is replaced by the following text:\n'Fibre formed from synthetic linear macromolecules having in the chain recurring amide linkages of which at least 85 % are joined to aliphatic or cycloaliphatic units`.\n3. Nos 31 to 41 now read 34 to 44.\n4. A new No 31 is added:\n- the text in the column 'Name` reads 'Aramid`,\n- the text in the column 'Fibre description` reads:\n'Fibre formed from synthetic linear macromolecules made up of aromatic groups joined by amide or imide linkages, of which at least 85 % are joined directly to two aromatic rings and with the number of imide linkages, if the latter are present, not exceeding the number of amide linkages`.\n5. A new No 32 is added:\n- the text in the column 'Name` reads 'Polyimide`,\n- the text in the column 'Fibre description` reads:\n'Fibre formed from synthetic linear macromolecules having in the chain recurring imide units`.\n6. A new No 33 is added:\n- the text in the column 'Name` reads 'Lyocell`,\n- the text in the column 'Fibre description` reads:\n'A regenerated cellulose fibre obtained by dissolution, and an organic solvent spinning process, without formation of derivatives`,\n- a reference to the footnote is added after the text in the column 'Name`. The footnote reads:\n'It is understood that an \"organic solvent\" means essentially a mixture of organic chemicals and water`.\n7. Consequently, No 22 is amended as follows:\nthe description is replaced by the following text:\n'A regenerated cellulose fibre obtained by a modified viscose process having a high breaking force and high wet modulus. The breaking force (BC) in the conditioned state and the force (BM) required to produce an elongation of 5 % in the wet state are:\nBC (CN) &ge; 1,3 &radic;T + 2 T\nBM (CN) &ge; 0,5 &radic;T\nwhere T is the mean linear density in decitex`.", "Annex II to Directive 96/74/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
