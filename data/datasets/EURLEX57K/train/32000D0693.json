Consequently, Italy has taken the view that this standard did not satisfy the essential health and safety requirements of the Directive and that its references should be withdrawn from publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities in order to no longer give a presumption of conformity with the Directive.\n(7) Technical Committee CEN/TC 144 examined this problem and started work on revising this standard. In view of the significant difficulties it encountered in this revision, it has concluded that it will be several years before the revised standard can be ratified.\n(8) Given the anticipated delay, it is proposed that the references of this standard be withdrawn immediately in order to avoid it being used as a harmonised standard in the future,", "main_body": ["The references of standard EN 703 \"Agricultural machinery - Silage cutters - Safety\" are withdrawn from publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
