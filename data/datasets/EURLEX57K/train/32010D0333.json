It provides that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from third countries or parts of the territory thereof, which have been free from glanders for a period of at least 6 months.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species\u00a0(3) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision.\n(3) Glanders occurs in parts of the territory of Brazil and therefore imports of equidae, and, as a consequence, of their semen, ova and embryos, are only authorised from the disease-free parts of the territory of that third country listed in column 4 of Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC. The State of Goi\u00e1s is listed in that column. The Distrito Federal is a distinct administrative entity situated within the State of Goi\u00e1s. From an epidemiological point of view it has been considered part of the State of Goi\u00e1s and not been specifically mentioned in that column.\n(4) In April 2010 Brazil notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the confirmation of a case of glanders in a horse in Distrito Federal. Since Distrito Federal is no longer free from glanders, Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should be amended in order to indicate that the introduction into the Union of equidae and of semen, ova and embryos of animals of the equine species are no longer authorised from that region.\n(5) In addition, the Commission has received a report about confirmed cases of glanders in Bahrain. The introduction of registered horses and of semen thereof from Bahrain should therefore no longer be authorised.\n(6) Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the entry for Bahrain is replaced by the following:\n\u2018BH Bahrain BH-0 Whole country E - - - - - - - - -\u2019\n2. the entry for Brazil is replaced by the following:\n\u2018BR Brazil BR-0 Whole country  - - - - - - - - - -\nBR-1 The States of: D X X X X X X X X X\nBR-2 Distrito Federal D - - - - - - - - -\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p. 42.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 14.9.1992, p. 54.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a073, 11.3.2004, p. 1."}
