As a result, detailed rules for the administration of those quotas should be laid down.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1458/2003 of 18\u00a0August 2003 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas in the pigmeat sector\u00a0(2) has been substantially amended several times and further changes are needed. Regulation (EC) No 1458/2003 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(3) Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3) and 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(4) should apply, save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, the quota period running from 1 July to 30 June the following year should be subdivided into several subperiods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(5) The import tariffs should be administered on the basis of import certificates. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.\n(6) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in question in the pigmeat sector, precise conditions should be laid down as regards operators' access to the tariff quota scheme.\n(7) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.\n(8) In the interests of the operators, the Commission should determine the quantities that have not been applied for, which will be added to the next quota subperiod in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01301/2006.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quotas in Annex I are hereby opened for the import of pigmeat products under the CN codes indicated therein.\nThe tariff quotas shall be open on an annual basis for the period from 1 July to 30 June the following year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quotas referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable rate of customs duty, the order numbers and the group numbers shall be as set out in Annex I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with this Regulation, products of CN codes ex\u00a00203\u00a019\u00a055 and ex\u00a00203\u00a029\u00a055 referred to in groups G2 and G3 of Annex I have the following meanings assigned to them:\n(a) \u2018boneless loins\u2019, loins and cuts thereof, without tenderloin, with or without subcutaneous fat or rind;\n(b) \u2018tenderloin\u2019, cuts including the meats of muscles musculus major psoas and musculus minor psoas, with or without head, trimmed or not trimmed.", "The provisions of Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "The quantity set for the annual tariff quota period for each order number shall be subdivided into four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 25\u00a0% from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) 25\u00a0% from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) 25\u00a0% from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) 25\u00a0% from 1 April to 30 June.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, import licence applicants shall, when submitting their first application for a given annual quota period, furnish proof that they imported or exported, during each of the two periods referred to in that Article, at least 50\u00a0tonnes of products covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No\u00a02759/75.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications may refer to only one of the order numbers indicated in Annex I to this Regulation.
