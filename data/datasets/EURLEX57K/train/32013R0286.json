Accumulation of such surplus quantities can also give rise to distortion of competition likely to affect the proper functioning of the common organisation of the markets. Surplus stocks may also result from national production. Provisions should, therefore, be made for effective, proportionate, and deterrent charges at the amount of the difference between import duties applicable in Croatia before accession and the import duties applicable in the Union increased with 20\u00a0%, to be levied on surplus stocks in Croatia.\n(3) It is necessary to prevent goods in respect of which export refunds were paid before 1 July 2013 from benefiting from a second export refund when exported to third countries after 30 June 2013.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Regulation shall apply to products set out in the Annex.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation \u2018products\u2019 means agricultural products and/or goods not included in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.", "Charges on holders of products in free circulation\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Section 3(a) of Annex IV to the Act of Accession, and where stricter legislation does not apply at national level, Croatia shall levy charges on holders of surplus stocks at 1 July 2013 of products in free circulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine the surplus stock of each holder, Croatia shall take into account:\n(a) averages of stocks available in the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2013;\n(b) the pattern of trade in the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2013;\n(c) the circumstances in which stocks were built up.\nThe notion \u2018surplus stocks\u2019 applies to products imported into or originating from Croatia and to such products outside the customs territory of Croatia but intended for the market in Croatia.\nThe recording of the stocks shall be performed on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature applicable on 1 July 2013.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of the charge referred to in paragraph 1 shall, for each product concerned, be equal to the amount by which the import duty applicable in the Union in accordance with Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87\u00a0(1), including any applicable additional duty on 30 June 2013, exceeds the import duty applicable in Croatia on that date, plus 20\u00a0% of that amount.
