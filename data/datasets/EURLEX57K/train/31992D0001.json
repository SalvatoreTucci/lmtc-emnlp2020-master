With a view to developing legislation on the control of African swine fever in pigs kept under extensive and semi-extensive husbandry systems, the Community shall undertake scientific measures to determine the importance of soft ticks  (Ornithodorus erraticus) in the epidemiology of the said disease.\n2. The objectives of the measures to be carried out in Portugal are:\n- to map distribution of ticks,\n- to determine the period of survival of ticks on farms which have been depopulated of pigs due to African swine fever and whether ticks can survive by feeding on other vertebrate hosts,\n- to determine whether sentinel pigs are a satisfactory way of monitoring virus persistence in ticks on infected premises.\n3. The objectives of measures to be performed in the United Kingdom are:\n- to determine virus infection and excretion rates in Portuguese ticks infected with virus isolates collected in different areas of Portugal,\n- to determine the efficiency and duration of virus transmission to pigs by infected ticks.", "The scientific measures provided for in Article 1 shall be carried out and ensured by the conclusion of a contract between the Commission and the Lisbon Veterinary School, Portugal and the AFRC Institute of animal health, Pirbright  Laboratory, United Kingdom.", "The Community shall reimburse the costs of the scientific measures referred to in Article 1 up to a maximum of ECU 34 100 in accordance with the modalities of the contract.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 1991.
