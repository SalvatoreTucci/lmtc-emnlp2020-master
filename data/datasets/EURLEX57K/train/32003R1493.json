The current situation as regards implementation of the balance shows that the quantities laid down for supplying the two departments are insufficient to cover their needs.\n(3) By letter dated 6 June 2003, the French authorities therefore submitted a request for an amendment to the balance for Martinique and French Guiana in order to satisfy the supply needs of the two departments.\n(4) In the light of the supporting documentation provided, the quantities of cereals provided for in the forecast supply balance should be increased.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 98/2003 contains a technical error concerning the quantities of products processed from fruit and vegetables falling within CN code 2008 intended for processing or packing in the Canary Islands. That error in the forecast supply balance for the Canary Islands should consequently be corrected.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 98/2003 should therefore be amended and corrected.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committee for Cereals and the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 98/2003 is hereby replaced by the Annex hereto.", "In Part 4 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 98/2003, note 2 is hereby corrected as follows:\n\"(2) Including 5300 tonnes for the products intended for processing and/or packaging.\"", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "shall apply from 1 January 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 August 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 45.\n(3) OJ L 293, 29.10.2002, p. 11.\n(4) OJ L 14, 21.1.2003, p. 32.\n(5) OJ L 107, 30.4.2003, p. 3.\nANNEX\n\"Part 1 Cereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feed; oilseeds, protein crops, dried fodder\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n>TABLE>\""}
