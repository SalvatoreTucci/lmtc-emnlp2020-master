whereas, therefore, provision should be made for the application  of a reduced of duty until the end of the current marketing year;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3089/78  (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3461/87   (4), lays down that the release of imported olive oil for free circulation in the Community is  subject to the provision of a security equal to the consumption aid; whereas the level of duty  resulting from the Agreements is calculated taking the said security into account; whereas olive  oil released for free circulation from 1 July 1995 after payment of the rate of duty provided for  in this Regulation should not be subject to the system of securities, given that the duty includes  a component corresponding to the level of security now applicable and whereas such oil may  therefore be regarded as qualifying for consumption aid;\nWhereas it is the Commission's intention to present a proposal for an amendment to Council  Regulation (EEC) No 3089/78 to the Council shortly which would abolish the system of securities for  imported olive oil apart from oil imported from Tunisia under special arrangements; whereas these  transitional measures are necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the market organization  during the transition from the present arrangements to those resulting from the Agreements;\nWhereas, for reasons of clarity and legal certainty, the conditions applicable to the use after 1  July 1995 of import licences issued before that date should be specified and the rate of duty  applicable to imports of olive oil from Tunisia under Council Regulation (EC) No 287/94 should be  laid down  (5);\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 2a of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the rates of  duty applicable during the period 1 July to 31 October 1995 to imports of the products referred to  in the Annex shall be as set out therein.", "Import licences issued until 30 June 1995 pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No  2751/78  (6) and which are valid beyond that date may be used until their term of validity  expires.\nThe duty applicable to imports against such licences shall be equal to the levy fixed in advance in  the licences.", "The rate of duty applicable to imports of olive oil originating in Tunisia covered by  Regulation (EC) No 287/94 in the period 1 July to 31 October 1995 shall be equal to ECU 9,419 per  100 kilograms.", "Notwithstanding Article 9 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3089/78, no security need  be lodged for the release of olive oil for free circulation in the Community, with the exception of  olive oil for free circulation in the Community, with the exception of olive oil originating in  Tunisia and imported under the arrangements provided for in Regulation (EC) No 287/94 and olive oil  imported in accordance with Article 2.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the  Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 1995.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 1995.\nFor the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission\nANNEX\nOlive oil\n>TABLE>"}
