Article 14 (4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be  reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.\n(3)  As in the case of another type of electronic microcircuit, i.e. DRAMs  (4), since the end of  1993 and the beginning of 1994, due to a strong and growing demand for EPROMs , in particular by  telecommunication equipment manufacturers, prices of EPROMs, on a world-wide basis, have remained  stable.\nWith respect to the Community market in particular, the Commission has been able to follow  developments as almost all known Japanese EPROM producers supply the Commission on a regular basis  with their detailed sales reports pursuant to undertakings which the Commission has accepted in the  framework of the abovementioned anti-dumping proceeding  (5). An analysis of these reports has  confirmed that the market behaviour of the exporters concerned is in line with the general  evaluation of price developments made by market research companies, some of which monitor the  semiconductor market particularly closely.\n(4)  With regard to the situation of the Community EPROM industry, the Commission has furthermore  received information confirming that this industry has also benefited from the current market  situation. Indeed, following the stabilization of the situation of the Community industry  concurrently with the introduction of the above anti-dumping measures and following the substantial  investments made for the production of the newest generations of EPROMs the Community industry's  revenues stemming from an increase in EPROM sales volumes and in EPROM prices have had the effect  that the Community industry is no longer suffering financial losses on current sales, but rather  generating increased returns.\n(5)  The anti-dumping duty was imposed in order to underpin the undertakings and in order to ensure  that imports of any EPROMs outside the scope of the undertakings would not be made at an injurious  price level. The present market situation is one of strong demand, where market forces are  sustaining a level of prices for EPROMs which is at or above the prices at which the above  companies have undertaken to sell in the Community. It appears therefore that the absence of  injurious dumping of EPROMs on the Community market at present is not dependent on the maintenance  of the anti-dumping measures. Whilst the minimum prices applicable pursuant to the undertakings  have been overtaken by market prices, the continued existence of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty  constitutes an unnecessary barrier to entry to the Community market for EPROMs not covered by an  undertaking.\n(6)  However, based on previous experience gained in the EPROM-market, it appears reasonable to  conclude that this development in prices may well be temporary. Indeed, the EPROM-market is a  cyclical market characterised by sharp up and downturns in prices. The likelihood that current  market conditions are a temporary phenomenon leads to the conclusion that this situation should be  dealt with by a temporary suspension of the anti-dumping duty.\n(7)  In conclusion, the Commission considers that all requirements to suspend the anti-dumping duty  concerned pursuant to Article 14 (4) are met and that therefore this duty should be suspended for a  period of nine months. This conclusion has been reached on the basis of:\n-  reliable sales information collected in the course of the anti-dumping proceeding concerned,  reflecting market prices in the Community,\n-  the overall situation of the world EPROM market which, given the extensive market research data  available, is inherently transparent, and -  experience of the cyclical nature of this industry.\n(8)  The Commission will continue to closely monitor the development of the EPROM market and the  behaviour of individual market participants, in particular with respect to the newest generation of  EPROMs. Should a situation arise in which a resumption of injury to the Community industry occurs,  the Commission will reinstate the above anti-dumping measures without delay.\n(9)  To this end, the obligation to submit reports on sales and prices pursuant to the undertakings  will enable the Commission to monitor the EPROM market. However, the Commission considers that,  during the period of the suspension of the anti-dumping duty, the obligation to adhere to the  minimum price provisions of these undertakings should be discontinued. The quarterly calculation  and communication of such prices to these companies by the Commission will therefore be  discontinued during this period.\n(10)  In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 (4) of the basic Regulation the Commission  has informed the complainant of its intention to suspend the above anti-dumping measures and has  provided it with an opportunity to comment. These comments have been taken into account reaching  the present decision.\n(11)  The Advisory Committee was consulted on the suspension of the anti-dumping measures and  raised no objections,", "main_body": ["The definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain  types of electronic microcircuits known as EPROMs (erasable programmable read only memories)  originating in Japan by Council Regulation (EEC) No 577/91 is hereby suspended for a period of nine  months.\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal  of the European Communities."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 1995.\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President"}
