By significantly raising the limits of compensation available in the present international system, the Supplementary Fund Protocol addresses one of the most significant shortcomings in the international regulation of oil pollution liability.\n(2) Articles 7 and 8 of the Supplementary Fund Protocol affect Community legislation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\u00a0(2).\n(3) The Community has exclusive competence in relation to Articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol, insofar as those Articles affect the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. The Member States retain their competence for matters covered by the Protocol which do not affect Community law.\n(4) Pursuant to the Supplementary Fund Protocol, only sovereign States may be party to it; it is not therefore possible for the Community to ratify or accede to the Protocol, nor is there a prospect that it will be able to do so in the near future.\n(5) The Council should therefore, exceptionally, authorise the Member States to sign and conclude the Supplementary Fund Protocol in the interest of the Community, under the conditions set out in this Decision.\n(6) The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 and are therefore taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(8) Only Contracting Parties to the underlying instruments may become Contracting Parties to the Supplementary Fund Protocol. Austria and Luxembourg are not currently parties to the underlying instruments. Since the underlying instruments contain provisions affecting Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, Austria and Luxembourg should also be authorised to accede to these instruments.\n(9) Member States, with the exception of Austria and Luxembourg, should sign or ratify the Protocol, as far as possible before the end of June 2004. The choice of either signing and subsequently ratifying the Protocol, or signing it without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval, is left to the Member States.\n(10) The situation of Austria and Luxembourg is different in that they cannot become Contracting Parties to the Supplementary Fund Protocol until they have acceded to the underlying instruments. For this reason, Austria and Luxembourg should therefore accede to the underlying instruments and to the Supplementary Fund Protocol, as far as possible by 31 December 2005\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States are hereby authorised to sign, ratify or accede to, in the interest of the European Community, the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, (the Supplementary Fund Protocol) subject to the conditions set out in the following Articles.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Austria and Luxembourg are authorised to accede to the underlying instruments.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of the Supplementary Fund Protocol is attached in Annex I to this Decision.
