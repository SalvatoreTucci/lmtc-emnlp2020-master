In order to enable the hops sector to continue to function properly, it is necessary to lay down those provisions in Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01299/2007 of 6\u00a0November 2007 on the recognition of producer groups for hops\u00a0(3).\n(3) The Single CMO Regulation has laid down in Article\u00a0122 the general conditions for the recognition of producer organisations by the Member States. Those conditions should be specified for the hops sector. For sake of consistency, the term \u2018producer groups\u2019 should continue to be used in that sector.\n(4) To avoid any discrimination between producers and to ensure the unity and effectiveness of any action undertaken, conditions should be laid down, for the whole of the Community, with which producer groups must comply in order to be recognised by the Member States. To achieve an effective centralisation of supply, it is necessary in particular that the groups should be of an economically viable size and that the entire output of producers should be marketed either directly by the group or by the producers, according to common rules.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01299/2007 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a01299/2007 is amended as follows:\n1.
