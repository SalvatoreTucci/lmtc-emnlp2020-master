It has noted that the Government of Zimbabwe has not taken effective measures to improve the situation as called for by the European Council in Laeken last December.\n(2) The Council has assessed that the Government of Zimbabwe continues to engage in serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly. Therefore, for as long as the violations occur, the Council deems it necessary to introduce restrictive measures against the government of Zimbabwe and those who bear a wide responsibility for such violations.\n(3) Therefore, Common Position 2002/145/CFSP provides that certain restrictive measures will be taken in respect of Zimbabwe, in particular the freezing of funds, financial assets or economic resources of individual members of the Government and natural or legal persons associated with them as well as a ban on exports on repression equipment and a ban on technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities.\n(4) These measures fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the said measures as far as the territory of the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Regulation:\n1. \"Funds, other financial assets or economic resources\" means assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, however acquired, and legal documents or instruments in any form, including electronic or digital, evidencing title to, or interest in, such assets, including, but not limited to, bank credits, travellers' cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares, securities, bonds, drafts and letters of credit;\n2. \"freezing of funds, other financial assets or economic resources\" means: preventing any move, transfer, alteration, use of or dealing with funds in any way that would result in any change in their volume, amount, location, ownership, possession, character, destination or other change that would enable the use of the funds, including portfolio management.", "1.
