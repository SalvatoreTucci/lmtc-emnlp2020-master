whereas, nevertheless, for  producers who transfer their set-aside requirement to another producer in accordance with Article 7   (7), second indent, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92  (3), as last amended by Regulation  (EC) No 2800/95  (4), the rate for rotational set-aside is increased by 5  %; whereas, however,  this increase is reduced to 3  % for cases covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93; whereas it is  therefore necessary to determine which cases are covered by the latter Regulation;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 authorized a non rotational setaside rate of an  additional three percentage points on the rotational rate for land set-aside for the 1994/95 and  1995/96 marketing years in a Member State where the area to be entered into set aside in the first  year of the scheme was forecast to exceed 13  % of its base area; whereas during that period the  Commission was required to carry out a study in order to ascertain the effects of rotation on  yields in Member States which qualified; whereas it was intended that the decision would be taken,  on the basis of such report, as to the rate which should apply in such Member States as from the  1996/97 marketing year;\nWhereas the United Kingdom satisfied the criterion set out above; whereas the Commission carried  out a study in the United Kingdom; whereas the results of that study are inconclusive because of  the very low number of producers who effected non-rotational set-aside, and because the data for  the second of the two marketing years is not yet available;\nWhereas there is currently no sound basis on which to determine whether or not the three additional  percentage points afford the same guarantee in terms of production control as the rate adopted for  rotational set-aside; whereas the results of the study which are currently available do not,  however, exclude this possibility;\nWhereas Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 also authorizes a non-rotational set-aside rate of an  additional three percentage points on the rotational rate in the vulnerable zones referred to in  Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against  pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural souces  (5), or in the whole of the territory of a  Member State which applies the action programmes in the Directive to the whole of its territory;  whereas such authorization is conditional on the Commission accepting that there is a significant  reduction in the use of fertilizers in the Member State concerned; whereas the Commission was  required to draw up a report at the end of the 1995/96 marketing year concerning the effect on  production; whereas until the report is completed, no definitive conclusions can be drawn; whereas  however the Commission recognizes that the reduction in the use of fertilizers in Denmark can be  considered to be significant, which applies the action programmes provided for in Directive  91/676/EEC;\nWhereas producers in Denmark and the United Kingdom should, for the marketing year 1996/97, be  treated as cases covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 for the purposes of transfers of their  set-aside requirement;\nWhereas the Joint Management Committee for Cereals, Oils and Fats and Dried Fodder has not  delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of applying Article 7 (7), second indent, of  Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, in cases where land is set-aside for the 1996/97 marketing year in  Denmark and the United Kingdom, these shall be considered as cases covered by Regulation (EEC) No  1541/93.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official  Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 1995.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission"}
