Pursuant to Article 103c(3) of that Regulation, Member States are required to provide that operational programmes in the fruit and vegetables sector include two or more environmental actions or that at least 10\u00a0% of the expenditure under the operational programmes covers environmental actions. That Regulation also provides that support for environmental actions has to cover additional costs and income foregone resulting from the action.\n(2) In accordance with Article 60(1) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0543/2011 of 7 June 2011 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007 in respect of the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors\u00a0(2), Annex IX to that Implementing Regulation sets out the list of actions or expenditure not eligible for support under operational programmes. However, it indicates that specific costs for environmental measures, including costs generated by environmental management of packaging are, as an exception, eligible.\n(3) Experience in applying environmental actions related to management of packaging shows that there are uncertainties about the net environmental benefits resulting from those actions and/or the fact that they effectively result in additional costs and income foregone being borne by the producer organisations and, thus, about the justification for the public support provided. Moreover, both the management and the control of those actions have proved to be complex, in particular, in respect of the calculation of the support that can be granted. Based on that experience and in order to encourage the implementation of more cost-effective environmental actions and to reduce the costs related to the management of the Union regime, it is appropriate to abandon support to environmental actions related to management of packaging.\n(4) Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0543/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0543/2011\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No\u00a0543/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1) Article 60(4) is amended as follows:\n(a) in the first subparagraph, point (c) is deleted;\n(b) the second subparagraph is deleted;\n(2) in the first paragraph of point 1 of Annex IX, the fourth indent is replaced by the following:\n\u2018\u2014 specific costs of environmental actions referred to in Article 103c(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01234/2007.
