Cases of classical swine fever in feral pigs have been reported in several Member States in the last years. In many circumstances the control of the disease has been difficult and classical swine fever has spread from the feral to the domestic pig population.\n(2) The gathering and exchange of epidemiological information on classical swine fever in the feral pig population in the Member States is of fundamental importance to establish the appropriate measures for controlling the disease in this population and verifying their efficacy.\n(3) Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever(3) establishes rules on the collection of information in relation to classical swine fever in feral pigs. Further rules may be established according to Comitology procedures.\n(4) The Bundesforschungsanstalt f\u7aefr Viruskrankheiten der Tiere, Institut f\u7aefr Epidemiologie, Wusterhausen, Germany, is in the process of establishing a digital database for the collection and exchange of epidemiological information via the Internet on classical swine fever in feral pigs. This database will be shared with other Member States in order to verify its validity as a tool to control the disease.\n(5) A financial contribution should be granted for that project, as it may contribute to the development of Community legislation on classical swine fever and to a better control of the disease.\n(6) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(4), veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules are financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
