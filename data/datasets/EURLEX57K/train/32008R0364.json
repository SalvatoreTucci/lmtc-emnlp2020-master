Implementing tools should therefore be laid down, supplemented by the instructions contained in the Eurostat Recommendations Manual on the Production of Foreign Affiliates Statistics, as revised regularly.\n(3) It is also necessary to grant derogations from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations to their national statistical systems. This relates in particular in the development of new statistical registers and the methods of data collection. The particular problem for outward FATS is that the statistical unit of analysis differs from the reporting unit and is not resident in the Member States.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee,", "main_body": ["The technical format referred to in Article 9(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 for the common module for inward statistics on foreign affiliates shall be as set out in Annex I to this Regulation.", "Member States shall apply the format referred to in Article 1 for the data concerning the first reference year referred to in Section 4, paragraph 1, of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 716/2007, and subsequent years.", "The technical format referred to in Article 9(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 for the common module for outward statistics on foreign affiliates shall be as set out in Annex II to this Regulation.", "Member States shall apply the format referred to in Article 3 for the data concerning the first reference year referred to in Section 4, paragraph 1, of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 716/2007, and subsequent years.", "The data to be submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 shall be transmitted in electronic form from competent national authorities to the Commission (Eurostat).

It is a necessary stage for providing data conforming to the interchange standards specified by the Commission (Eurostat).\nData is sent as a set of records of which a large part describes the characteristics of the data (country, reference year, economic activity, geographical breakdown, etc.). The data itself is a number which can be linked to flags and explanatory footnotes used for adding explanations to data which give users additional information regarding for instance extreme year-to-year changes. One file shall be provided per series of data.\nConfidential data have to be sent with the true value being recorded in the value field and a flag indicating the nature of the confidential data being added to the record. Member States have to provide all levels of aggregation of the breakdowns as defined in Regulation (EC) No 716/2007. In addition, data has to contain all secondary confidentiality flags in accordance with the confidentiality rules existing at national level.\nMember States have to provide complete sets for all series of data to be provided including records for all data required by Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 which are not available, i.e. which are not collected in the Member State. Data for activities/phenomena not existing in the Member State should be marked in the record as zero (code \u20180\u2019 in the value field). The code \u20180\u2019 in the value field can also be used for activities that do exist but for which the data is small and as a result of rounding equals zero. Monetary data has to be expressed in thousands of national currency units (thousands of euros for the countries of the euro area). Countries acceding to the euro area shall report in euros instead of national currency monetary data due in the year of their accession.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dataset identifier\nThe following dataset identifier will be used for reporting statistics on inward foreign affiliates:\nFor series 1G: SBSFATS_1GA1_A.\nFor series 1G2: SBSFATS_1GB1_A\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data structure and definition of fields\nThis section gives an overview of the data structure, and defines the fields, codes and attributes to be used.
