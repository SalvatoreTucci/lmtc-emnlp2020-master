It is therefore necessary to fix the difference by which this guaranteed quantity is to be reduced and then to divide it up between sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup on the one hand and the production regions concerned on the other, using the coefficients established for this purpose.\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, each Member State must then allocate the difference to which it is subject among the producer undertakings established on its territory on the basis of the existing ratio between their A and B quotas for the product in question and the basic quantity A and the basic quantity B for the Member State for this product.\n(4) Article 39(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that a reduction in the guaranteed quantity also necessitates a reduction in the presumed maximum raw sugar needs of Community refineries for the marketing year in question. It is therefore necessary to fix the corresponding reduction for these presumed maximum needs and to allocate it among the Member States concerned.\n(5) The time limits by which the Member States must establish the reduction applying to each producer undertaking on their territory and communicate the relevant data should be fixed.\n(6) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["1.
