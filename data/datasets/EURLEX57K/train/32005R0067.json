Those markets and products are listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000\u00a0(2).\n(2) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 requires that every two years the Commission shall draw up a list of the markets and products referred to in Article 3 and 4 of that Regulation.\n(3) The list of target markets should be revised to take account of the fact that Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey and Ukraine are export markets with particular interest for certain Member States and with export potential for the Community in general.\n(4) Flowers and plants are products where market balance could be improved through information and/or generic promotion measures in third countries. Those products should therefore be included in the list of products which may be covered by promotional measures in third countries.\n(5) It is appropriate to extend the reference to cheese and yogurt in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000 to include milk products in general.\n(6) Products with a protected designation of origin (PDO), with a protected geographical indication (PGI) or with a traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG) in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(3), or Council Regulation (EC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(4), and products from organic farming, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(5), are quality products the production of which are considered a priority in the context of the common agricultural policy. Those products should therefore be included in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000, so as to ensure that they can benefit from all promotion and information measures provided for in the third country promotion regime.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion delivered at the meeting of the Joint Management Committee for the Promotion of Agricultural Products,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000 is herewith replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 21.12.1999, p. 7.
