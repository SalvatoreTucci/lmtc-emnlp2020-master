It is therefore appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 606/2004.\n(4) In light of a proper management of the GATT export commitments it is appropriate to adapt the export licence validity period for the groups of products concerned; taking account of the quantities remaining in the respective export quotas at the end of the GATT year and with a view on an optimal use of the available quantities.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, the term of validity of export licences with advance fixing of the refund, which are applied for until 23 June 2004 in respect of the products referred to in points (a) and (c) of that Article, shall expire on 30 June 2004.", "Regulation (EC) No 606/2004 is repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to export licences applied for from that date.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 June 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 48.
