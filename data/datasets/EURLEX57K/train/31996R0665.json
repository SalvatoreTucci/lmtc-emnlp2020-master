whereas, consequently, certain producers were not able to effect the transfers of rights or temporary leases provided for in Article 5a (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 within the time limits provided for in Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 for the 1995 marketing year; whereas the Member State concerned should therefore be authorized, on certain conditions designed to limit the risk of irregularities as far as possible, to set a second deadline for notification by the producers concerned of such transfers or temporary leasing of rights for the 1995 marketing year;\nWhereas the administrative difficulties in question are also likely to affect the mechanisms set up for transfers and temporary leasing of rights in respect of the 1996 marketing year; whereas, therefore, it should also be laid down that the Member State in question may set a second deadline for certain transfers and temporary leases in respect of the 1996 marketing year under the conditions referred to above;\nWhereas the application of the special reserve with a ceiling of 600 000 rights each for Italy and Greece, introduced by Article 5b (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2134/95 (5) leads to the creation of additional rights to the ewe and she-goat premium for certain producers as from the 1995 marketing year; whereas the said rights have been allocated according to the eligible livestock numbers held during the 1991 and 1992 marketing years by those producers; whereas the composition of the flocks held by the said producers may have changed substantially since those marketing years; whereas transfers or temporary leasing of the newly created additional rights should therefore be authorized; whereas Italy and Greece should therefore be authorized to set a second deadline for the notification by the producers concerned of the said transfers or temporary lease of rights in respect of the 1995 and 1996 marketing years;\nWhereas, for the same reasons, Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom should be authorized, as a special measure for the 1995 and 1996 marketing years, to extend the deadline provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 for the notification of transfers of premium rights and temporary leasing of those rights;\nWhereas the setting of a second deadline for the notification of transfers or temporary leasing of rights under the conditions referred to above also makes it necessary to derogate from the provisions laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 in respect of the 1995, 1996 and 1997 marketing years for Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheepmeat and Goatmeat,", "main_body": ["For the 1995, 1996 and 1997 marketing years, Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 shall not apply:\n(a) in the case of the United Kingdom, to rights obtained by transfer and/or temporary lease for the marketing year in question before the allocation of rights under national reserves relating to the same marketing year has been communicated;\n(b) in the case of Italy and Greece, to rights obtained with effect from the 1995 marketing year under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2134/95.", "By way of derogation from Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92, for the 1995 and 1996 marketing years, the United Kingdom may set a second deadline for producers meeting one of the following conditions:\n1.
