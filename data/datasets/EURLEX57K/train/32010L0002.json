However, chlormequat was included in Annex I to that Directive with the specific provision that Member States may only authorise uses on cereals.\n(3) In addition to that use, Belgium and Sweden now have applied for an amendment to this specific provision to allow chlormequat to be used on ornamentals and grass for seed, respectively. These Member States informed the Commission on 29 October 2009 and 4 November 2009 about their conclusions that the requested extensions of use do not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for chlormequat in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. In particular, the extensions concern applications on non-edible crops and, as a consequence, no residues in food will occur. Furthermore, the other application parameters, as set out in the specific provisions of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, remain unchanged.\n(4) Therefore it is justified to modify the specific provisions for chlormequat.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 28 May 2010 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
