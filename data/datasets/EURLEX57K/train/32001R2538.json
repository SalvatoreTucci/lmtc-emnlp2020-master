Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and certify (except where specifically provided otherwise) that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should, however, be authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2003 licences of which at least 50 % has been used by the application date.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textiles Committee,", "main_body": ["The purpose of this Regulation is to lay down rules concerning the management of quantitative quotas for imports of certain textiles products set out in Annexes IIIB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 for the year 2002.", "The quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis according to the chronological order of receipt by the Commission of Member States' notifications of applications from individual operators, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities per operator set out in the Annex.\nThese maximum quantities shall not, however, apply to operators able to prove to the competent national authorities when making their first application for 2002 that they imported, for given categories, given third countries and under import licences granted to them for 2001, more than the maximum quantities specified for each category.\nIn the case of such operators, the competent authorities may authorise imports of no more than the quantities imported in 2001 for given third countries and given categories, provided that enough quota is available.", "Any importer who has used 50 % or more of the amount allocated to him under this Regulation may make a further application, in respect of the same category and country of origin, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities laid down in the Annex.", "1.
