As a consequence, they were included in the list of countries exempted from certain TSE-related trade conditions for live bovine animals and products of bovine, ovine and caprine origin.\n(2) In its updated opinions adopted in February 2005 and August 2005 on the geographical BSE risk of certain third countries, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle of Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland is not highly unlikely. Therefore those countries should no longer be exempted from the TSE-related trade conditions for live bovine animals and products of bovine, ovine and caprine origin.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on The Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1.
