Therefore, metconazole was included in Annex I to that Directive with the specific provisions that Member States may only authorise uses as fungicide.\n(3) In addition to the control of fungi in certain agricultural uses, the notifier now has applied for an amendment to those specific provisions as regards the use as a plant growth regulator. In order to support such an extension of the use, the notifier submitted additional information.\n(4) Belgium evaluated the information and data submitted by the notifier. It informed the Commission in October 2007 that it concluded that the requested extension of use does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for metconazole in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. This is particularly the case since the extension covers applications at rates that are lower than those necessary for a use as fungicide while the other application parameters as set out in the specific provisions of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC remain unchanged.\n(5) Therefore it is justified to modify the specific provisions for metconazole.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 5 August 2008 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
