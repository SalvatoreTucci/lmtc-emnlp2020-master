PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\n(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 (hereinafter referred to as \"the provisional Regulation\"), imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on certain imports of flat pallets of wood falling within CN code ex 4415 20 20 originating in the Republic of Poland and accepted undertakings offered from certain exporting producers. These undertakings concerned only one pallet type, i. e. the EUR pallet.\n(2) Since sampling was used in the investigation, requests for reviews under Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 could not be accepted. However, in order to ensure equal treatment between new exporters and the cooperating companies not included in the sample during the original investigation, the provisional Regulation was amended. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 stipulated that new Polish exporting producers could have undertakings accepted with regard to exports of EUR pallets, provided they satisfied the criteria set out therein.\n(3) By Regulation (EC) No 2334/97(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2048/1999(7), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland.\nB. NEW EXPORTERS' REQUEST\n(4) Following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2334/97, six further new Polish exporting producers have requested that Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 be applied to them and they offered undertakings with regard to the EUR pallets. They have also provided sufficient evidence pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 showing that they are genuine new exporting producers. In application of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1023/97, the undertakings offered by these six Polish exporting producers with regard to the EUR pallet should therefore be accepted.\nC. WITHDRAWAL OF UNDERTAKING\n(5) Two Polish exporting producers, P.P.H. \"Pamadex\" and P.H.U. \"Akropol\", from which the Commission accepted an undertaking under Regulation (EC) No 1023/97, have stated that they do not produce the product concerned any longer. Therefore, the Commission informed them that it is intended to remove them from the list of companies from which an undertaking was accepted. The two companies did not object to this course of action. It should also be noted that those two companies could again offer an undertaking should they decide to resume production and exports of the EUR pallets.\nD.
