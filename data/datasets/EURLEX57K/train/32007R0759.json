However, as the Agreement is applicable as from 1 March 2007, the annual quantity for 2007 should be adjusted accordingly.\n(3) The Agreement specifies that the opening of the tariff quota is to be made as from 1 July, on the basis of nine months for 2007. This Regulation should therefore apply as from 1 July 2007.\n(4) The tariff quota should be managed on a first-come, first-served basis. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4).\n(5) Given that the quota under this Regulation does not present a risk of market disturbance, it should be regarded initially as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Therefore, customs authorities should be authorised to waive the requirement for security in respect of goods initially imported under those quotas in accordance with Articles 308c(1) and 248(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 and Article 308c(2) and (3) of that Regulation should not apply.\n(6) It should be clarified which kind of proof certifying the origin of products has to be provided by operators in order to benefit from the tariff quota under the first-come, first served system.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Community tariff quota for sausages falling within CN code 1601 originating in Iceland (hereinafter the tariff quota), as set out in the Agreement between the Community and Iceland as approved by Decision 2007/138/EC, is hereby opened.\nThe tariff quota shall be opened annually for the period from 1 January to 31 December.\nThe order number of the tariff quota shall be 09.0809.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annual quantity, expressed in net weight, of sausages imported under the tariff quota, as well as the customs duty applicable are laid down in the Annex.\nFor the year 2007, the quantity available shall be 75 tonnes.", "The tariff quota shall be managed in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
