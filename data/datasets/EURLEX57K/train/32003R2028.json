Article 3(1) of that Regulation lays down that the annual import quota of 2981600 tonnes is to be divided into three subquotas: 572000 tonnes for the United States, 38000 tonnes for Canada and 2371600 tonnes for other third countries.\n(2) Since the beginning of the third quarter of 2003, the take-up of subquota III, covering most imports of poor- and medium-quality wheat onto the Community market, has slowed down considerably compared with the beginning of 2003. This is because of a large fall in Russian and Ukrainian cereal exports following very large falls in production during the 2003/04 marketing year.\n(3) In addition, following the return to normal wheat production levels in Canada and the United States, those two countries have become more competitive on the Community market at the beginning of the 2003/04 marketing year. Subquota II has now been used up and, on the basis of the principal international price quotations, subquota I will also probably be fully used up by the end of 2003.\n(4) On the internal market, Community production of common wheat has also fallen by around 10 million tonnes compared with the previous marketing year and this cannot be offset by other forage cereals. This situation is causing tensions on the wheat market, particularly as regards animal feed.\n(5) Under these circumstances, in order to ensure full use of all the subquotas, a derogation should be made from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 to make subquota III available to all third countries until the end of the first year of application of the tariff quota arrangements. There will be no need to require the presentation of a certificate of origin for that subquota.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
