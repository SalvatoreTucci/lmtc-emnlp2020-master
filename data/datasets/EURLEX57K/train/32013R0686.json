Fruit, vegetables and cereals, fresh or processed\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the product to which the name in point 1 applies\n\u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 is a storage onion cultivated on terraces. It is pearly white to coppery in colour, with a roundish to elongated bulb, a shiny appearance and fine and translucent tunics. The scales are thick with a white, moderately firm and juicy flesh. The dry matter content is less than 10\u00a0%. Eaten raw, the flesh is crunchy but not sharp or bitter and has a fine, balanced flavour. Eaten cooked, it keeps its shine and becomes translucent, unctuous, juicy and sugary in taste, with no bitterness and a roasted, chestnut flavour.\nOnions packaged after 15 May of the year following the year of harvest may not bear the protected designation of origin \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019. The onions must be marketed in the original packaging used exclusively for the designation. Marketing may not begin before 1 August of the year of harvest.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nThe onions must be sown and produced in the geographical area.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\nPackaging takes place in the geographical area defined in point 4 of this single document. It is carried out in packaging plants identified by the group. The method used to close the package must be such that the package cannot be closed again once it has been opened. The onions are packaged in boxes and plastic film with a maximum capacity of 12\u00a0kg or in mesh bags with a maximum capacity of 5\u00a0kg.\nPackaging must be done in the prescribed geographical area to maintain quality.\nThe onions are packaged by the producer or are delivered to a packaging plant. Packaging within the prescribed area prevents excessive handling. This in turn preserves the onions\u2019 characteristics, in particular their fine, translucent and very fragile tunics, and does not alter the product. Lastly, organoleptic and analytical testing, which ensures that the onions comply with the organoleptic profile, is done by sampling packaged batches.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nEach package of onions to be granted the designation bears a label indicating at least the following:\n\u2014 the name of the protected designation of origin \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 written in a font at least as large as the largest font used on the label,\n\u2014 \u2018AOP\u2019 and/or \u2018appellation d\u2019origine prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2019, which must appear immediately before or after the name of the designation with no text in between,\n\u2014 the European Union PDO logo,\n\u2014 the name of the packager,\n\u2014 the date of packaging,\n\u2014 a specific identification number.\nThe identification number corresponds to the producer code followed by the parcel code. For packages of a maximum of 5\u00a0kg it may be replaced by a code covering batches entered on the same day.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area of the PDO \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 extends over the territories of the following 32 municipalities of the Department of Gard:\nArphy; Arre; Arrigas; Aulas; Aumessas; Av\u00e8ze; Bez-et-Esparon; Br\u00e9au-et-Salagosse; Colognac; Cros; Lasalle; Mandagout; Mars; Moli\u00e8res-Cavaillac; Monoblet; Notre-Dame-de-la-Rouvi\u00e8re; Pommiers; Roquedur; Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Majencoules; Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Valborgne; Saint-Bonnet-de-Salendrinque; Saint-Bresson; Sainte-Croix-de-Caderle; Saint-Julien-de-la-Nef; Saint-Laurent-le-Minier; Saint-Martial; Saint-Roman-de-Codi\u00e8res; Soudorgues; Sum\u00e8ne; Vabres; Valleraugue; Vigan (le).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe geographical area of the PDO \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 extends principally over granitic and schistose rocks on the southeast edge of the Massif Central and, in particular, along the slopes of the massif de l\u2019Aigoual (1\u00a0565\u00a0m). The climate, which is Mediterranean, is characterised by summer drought and large amounts of rainfall in the autumn and to a lesser extent in the spring, the average being 1\u00a0500\u00a0mm. Temperatures also fluctuate greatly. There is plenty of sunshine in the summer, while the weather is rather cold from autumn to spring, with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 12-13\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe hilly topography of C\u00e9vennes consists of ridges, the \u2018serres\u2019, that alternate with deep and narrow valleys that are oriented towards the northwest/southeast, the \u2018valats\u2019. The slope effect on these steep slopes leads to marked climatic contrasts, and the strong equinox rains accentuate erosion, sometimes causing devastating floods. In order to manage this topography, C\u00e9vennes farmers have transformed the slopes into terraces by identifying slightly deeper silted-up land and by building over large areas walls made of dry stones, a typical feature of the C\u00e9vennes landscape.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nThe organoleptic qualities of \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 has earned it a regional as well as a national reputation: the onion is characterised by great sweetness without any bitterness or sharpness, and a juiciness that gives it a very pleasant texture in the mouth, whether raw or cooked.\nFurthermore, it is visually recognisable and appreciated owing to its roundish to elongated bulb, its shininess, its pearly white, sometimes coppery, colour and its fine and translucent skins.\nIts low dry matter content (less than 10\u00a0%) does not prevent it from keeping well until the end of winter.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nCultivated on the southern slopes of the Massif Central, \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 is an original and specific onion, in terms of both its cultivation method and its physical and gustatory qualities.\nIn this particular environment man has known how to manage the land in order to take advantage of it, select a well-adapted variety and develop cultivation techniques that highlight a special product.\nThe natural constraints of the geographical area \u2014 the scarcity of level surfaces and the damage caused by erosion \u2014 have obliged farmers to organise the available space so that it can be used efficiently. The terracing of land, which is gravity-irrigated by the B\u00e9al, a canal bringing water from upstream rivers, rapidly became widespread starting in the 18th century and made it possible to increase the meagre farmable land areas. This helped feed a sizeable population and also protected the soil against erosion.\nFruits and vegetables were cultivated on the terraces that had the most favourable orientation and were half-way down the slope, irrigable and close to the hamlets. Soils formed from the decomposition of granites and schists are acid, sandy, filtering and poor in clay. Often they are fertilised with manure from neighbouring sheep and goat farms. Sweet onions started being cultivated in the area, first as a food crop before becoming a genuine form of agricultural production. The parcels where the onion had traditionally been grown, sometimes for more than 50 years, were called \u2018C\u00e9bi\u00e8res\u2019.\nThe traditional variety, improved and maintained by producers for many generations on the basis of appearance, sweetness and keeping properties, is well adapted to the local climate: it is a long-day plant, which is sowed in January in the most favourably oriented parcels so that it can benefit from the spring warmth. It is then transplanted manually and irrigated regularly; the bulbs are harvested at the end of summer, before the equinox rains of September. In this way they can dry in the field and be preserved in good, healthy conditions.\nThe cultural practices and the natural environment affect the characteristics of the onion throughout its growth cycle. Vigorous seedlings are obtained rapidly by sowing on the best parcels. With precise manual transplanting it is possible to optimise plant densities in order to be able to harvest bulbs having a sufficient size and a harmonious appearance, without any flat sides. The soil\u2019s poor clay content contributes to the sweetness of the onion but its sandy texture keeps the water reserves low. Therefore irrigation is necessary during the summer, and water is provided regularly in small amounts. This prevents waste and, above all, limits the hydric stress of the plant and the appearance of bitter and sharp tastes but keeps the scales juicy. Finally, parcels oriented towards the northeast to southwest are selected while moist valley bottoms are avoided so that the onions can be cultivated only on parcels with favourable microclimates. This results in earlier ripeness, with a smaller risk of plant-health problems. Consequently inputs can be reduced and the product keeps better.\nThe combination of natural factors in the geographical area, used effectively by farmers who have known how to employ the potential of the environment to the best advantage, have enabled all the original characteristics of \u2018Oignon doux des C\u00e9vennes\u2019 to be brought out.\nReference to publication of the specification\n(Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\nhttps://www.inao.gouv.fr/fichier/CDCOignonDouxDesCevennes.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
