Article 1 (1) is replaced by the following:\n'1. The purpose of this Directive is to restrict the permissible sound power level of airborne noise emitted in the environment by lawnmowers and the permissible sound pressure level of airborne noise emitted at the operator's position by lawnmowers with a cutting width exceeding 120 cm by setting down limit values and methods for measuring those levels.'\n2. Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 2\nMember States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that lawnmowers as defined in Article 1 may not be placed on the market unless:\n- their sound power levels, as measured under the conditions specified in Annex I, do not exceed the permissible level for the cutting width of the mower as shown in the following table:\n1,2.3 //  //  // Cutting width of lawnmower (L)  // Permissible sound power level in dB(A)/pW  //  //  // 1.2.3 //  // L \u00c2\u013e 50 cm   // 96   // 50 cm <   // L \u00c2\u013e 120 cm   // 100   //   // L > 120 cm   // 105   //    //  //\n- for lawnmowers with a cutting width exceeding 120 cm, the sound-pressure level of airborne noise, in dB(A), measured at the operator's position under the conditions specified in Annex Ia, does not exceed the level of 90 dB(A).'\n3. Article 4 is replaced by the following:\n'Article 4\nBefore being placed on the market, lawnmowers shall, in a clearly visible and durable fashion either directly or on a plate (such as a riveted or self-adhesive plate) permanently attached to them, bear marks identifying the manufacturer, describing the type and indicating the maximum sound power level expressed in dB(A)/pW and for lawnmowers with a cutting width exceeding 120 cm, an indication of the sound-pressure level expressed in dB(A)/20 mPa at the operator's position, guaranteed by the manufacturer.\nThe latter indication shall not be required on electrically powered lawnmowers with a cutting width of less than 30 cm, which, by virtue of their construction, are not noisy.\nThe models for these indications are set out in Annex III.'\n4. A new Annex Ia, the text of which is given in Annex I to this Directive, is inserted.\n5. Annex III is supplemented by the mark shown in Annex II to this Directive.\n6. For lawnmowers requiring sound-pressure level measurement to be made, Annex II is supplemented by the following text, to be added after 'Guaranteed sound power level dB(A)':\n'Guaranteed sound pressure level dB(A)'.", "1.
