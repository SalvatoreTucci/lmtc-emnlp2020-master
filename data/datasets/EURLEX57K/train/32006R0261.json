These terms, which are identical to Community additional traditional terms listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, are used for fortified wines, are regulated in South Africa and have been traditionally used for more than 10 years in the territory of that country. As these terms are strictly defined in an equivalent way as they are for certain Community wines and are used on labels indicating the true place of origin of the wines in question, they are not, therefore, used in a manner so as to mislead consumers. Accordingly, their use should be permitted on the Community market.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 should therefore, be amended accordingly.\n(4) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 is amended as follows:\n1. the part of Annex III referring to Portugal is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation;\n2.
