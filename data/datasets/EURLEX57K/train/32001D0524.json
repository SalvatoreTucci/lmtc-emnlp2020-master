These standards were presented to the Commission as harmonised standards.\n(7) In 2000, in application of Aricle 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Belgium raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.\n(8) In 2000, in application of Article 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Denmark raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000 and EN 13431:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.\n(9) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13428:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, with the exception of the requirements of the third indent of Annex II(1) to the Directive. This harmonised standard must accordingly be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities with a warning stating that it does not cover the requirements of that indent.\n(10) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13429:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(2) to the Directive. In particular, this standard does not cover the mandated requirement for a minimum number of trips or rotations in normally predictable conditions of use, or define a test method for checking this minimum number of trips or rotations. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n(11) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13430:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3a) to the Directive. In particular, the standard does not cover the essential requirements stipulating that in order to be considered recyclable, packaging must be manufactured in such a way as to enable the recycling of a certain percentage by weight of the materials used, according to the type of material used for the packaging. The standard does not, moreover, cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to cause problems in recovery and sorting prior to recycling, in the recycling process itself or in recycled products. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n(12) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13431:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive, as specified in Annex II(3b) to Directive 94/62/EC, for a minimum lower calorific value to allow optimisation of energy recovery. Furthermore, the standard does not cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to present problems in recovery and sorting prior to energy recovery, or in the energy recovery process itself. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n(13) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13432:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3c) and (3d). This harmonised standard must, accordingly, be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n(14) The Commission now calls on the CEN to undertake work to improve those standards which either in part or in full do not fulfil the essential requirements defined in the Directive,", "main_body": ["The references of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the form given in the Annex, accompanied by the following warning: \"Users of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 should note that this standard does not cover the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC as specified in the third indent of Annex II(1) thereto.\"\nWhen Member States publish the references of the national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 13428:2000, the publication must be accompanied by a warning identical to the one provided for in the first indent.", "The references of harmonised standards EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000 and EN 13431:2000 are not published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.", "The references of harmonised standard EN 13432:2000 are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the form given in the Annex.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 June 2001.\nFor the Commission\nMargot Wallstr\u0e23\u0e16m\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10.\n(2) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n(3) OJ L 217, 5.8.1998, p. 18.\nANNEX\nPublication of the references of harmonised standards pursuant to Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste\n>TABLE>\nNote:\nUsers of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 should note that this standard does not cover the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in the first and third indents of Annex II(1) to that Directive.\n>TABLE>\nNote:\n- Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European standardisation bodies or from the national standardisation bodies, a list of which is annexed to Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC.\n- Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Communities does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\nThe Commission ensures the updating of this list."}
