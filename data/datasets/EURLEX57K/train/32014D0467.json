The European Union has therefore decided to suspend the measures applied under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement as set out in Decision 2011/492/EU in order to be able to engage with and provide direct support to the democratically elected authorities in your efforts to consolidate, reconcile and develop the country, in collaboration with other international partners.\nThe European Union attaches the utmost importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, since respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law constitutes the essential basis of European Union-Guinea Bissau relations. The European Union will continue to closely follow the situation in the country.\nThe political and socioeconomic challenges that the country faces are significant, but we are confident that you will endeavour to take, in dialogue with all political groups, the decisions that are necessary, both at economic and financial level, and in the crucial areas of security sector reform and the fight against impunity.\nThe European Union remains firmly committed to its partnership with the people of Guinea Bissau. The present European Union decision to suspend the application of the appropriate measures and re-engage in dialogue and cooperation with the legitimate authorities is intended to provide new impetus to enhancing EU-Guinea Bissau relations, with the aim of normalising bilateral relations. However, the commitments made by Guinea Bissau in the framework of the Article 96 Consultation remain applicable and the European Union expects your Government to make all necessary efforts to achieve them as a matter of priority.\nThe European Union calls on all parties to seize the momentum to move the country towards democratic stability, rule of law, respect of human rights and socioeconomic development.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nC.
