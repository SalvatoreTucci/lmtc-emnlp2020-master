That will ensure that the build-up of additional reserves from implementing the countercyclical buffer is allocated to the financial system with excess credit growth.\n(3) The place of residence of the obligor or of the debtor should be generally used for determining the geographical location of all credit exposures as this is considered to best reflect the location where the risk is situated and which is, therefore, of importance to the financial system. However, the geographical location of credit exposures identified as specialised lending exposures pursuant to Article 147(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) should be based on the location of the assets generating the income that is the primary source of repayment of the obligation.\n(4) For a clear and unambiguous understanding of the measures for the identification of the geographical location of the relevant credit exposures, it is essential to specify a list of definitions of the technical terms used in this Regulation.\n(5) Exposures to a legal person should, in principle, be allocated to the Member State or to the third country, in which that person has its registered office. However, the place of actual centre of administration and the place of registered office of a legal person might differ. This has been recognised by the Court in its rulings in cases C-81/87 (Daily Mail), C-212/97 (Centros), C-208/00 (\u00dcberseering), C-167/01 (Inspire Art), C-411/03 (Sevic) and C-210/06 (Cartesio). To ensure proper allocation of the countercyclical capital buffer in those cases, institutions, who are aware that such a discrepancy exists with regard to an obligor, should allocate the relevant exposures to the place of the actual centre of the administration of the relevant legal person.\n(6) For exposures to collective investment undertakings (CIU), it is appropriate that they are allocated in the location of the obligor of the underlying exposure as defined in this Regulation. Where the definition of the obligor of the underlying exposure is unreasonably burdensome, the exposure to the CIU may be allocated to the home Member State of the institution.\n(7) Exposures to other assets should be allocated to the home Member State of the institution, if their obligor cannot be identified.\n(8) Proportionality and materiality considerations should be taken into account for institutions with limited foreign overall exposure or limited trading book activity, by allowing the use of simpler allocation methods for these institutions. This is intended to alleviate the burden for smaller institutions which tend to have limited foreign and trading book activity.\n(9) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.\n(10) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, it has analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u2018general credit exposure\u2019 means the risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of an exposure referred to in Article 140(4)(a) of Directive 2013/36/EU;\n(2) \u2018trading book exposure\u2019 means the risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of an exposure referred to in Article 140(4)(b) of Directive 2013/36/EU;\n(3) \u2018securitisation exposure\u2019 means the risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of an exposure referred to in Article 140(4)(c) of Directive 2013/36/EU;\n(4) \u2018location of the obligor\u2019 means the Member State or the third country, where the natural or legal person, who is the institution's counterparty to a general credit exposure or the issuer of a financial instrument not included in the trading book or the counterparty to a non-trading book exposure, is ordinarily resident (in the case of a natural person), or has its registered office (in the case of a legal person); for a legal person whose centre of actual administration is in a Member State or in a third country other than the Member State or the country of its registered office, \u2018location of the obligor\u2019 means the Member State or the third country of its actual place of administration;\n(5) \u2018location of the debtor\u2019 means the Member State or the third country, where the natural or legal person who is the issuer of the financial instrument in the trading book, or the counterparty to a trading book exposure, is ordinarily resident (in the case of a natural person), or has its registered office (in the case of a legal person); for a legal person whose centre of actual administration is in a Member State or in a third country other than the state or the country of its registered office, \u2018location of the debtor\u2019 means the Member State or the third country of its actual place of administration;\n(6) \u2018location of the income\u2019 means the Member State or the third country of the location of the assets which generate the income that is the primary source of repayment of the obligation in relation to a specialised lending exposure;\n(7) \u2018foreign exposure\u2019 means a general credit exposure whose obligor is not located in the institution's home Member State;\n(8) \u2018specialised lending exposure\u2019 means the general credit exposures possessing the characteristics referred to in Article\u00a0147(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.", "Location of general credit exposures\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All general credit exposures, which do not fall under paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article, shall be allocated to the location of the obligor.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General credit exposures to CIUs as referred to in point (o) of Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, shall be allocated to the location of the obligor of the underlying exposures.
