The aims are to:\n- support innovative and high-quality juvenile production by establishing new hatcheries and optimizing the technology of existing ones,\n- modernize fish farms, in particular sea bass, gilt-head sea bream and eel farms, in order to lower production costs,\n- diversify production and at the same time promote the use of species and technologies better adapted to the rational exploitation of the environmental resources,\n- develop lagoon aquaculture while promoting environmental protection by means of investment in the management of the 'valli' and lagoons in the form of water improvement schemes,\n- develop mariculture in conjunction with non-industrial fishing,\n- reduce the impact of diseases,\n- support projects to raise health standards of mollusc farms,\n- increase consumption of farmed fish by means of schemes involving quality control, the lowering of consumer prices and consumer information,\n- modernize trout farms in order to make them more competitive and reduce their impact on the environment.\nProtected sea areas\nStudy and evaluation of earlier projects. Support for the sector only in the case of projects actually incorporated in the management of the coastal area (development of offshore aquaculture and productive management of protected sea areas equiped for  those purposes)."}
