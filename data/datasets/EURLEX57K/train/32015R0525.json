Entries concerning those consignments should therefore be included in the list.\n(5) In addition, it is necessary to amend the endnotes set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 in order to ensure that the controls carried out by the Member States in accordance with that Regulation target at least the pesticides listed in the control programme adopted in accordance with Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0396/2005\u00a0(3) that can be analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS. It is also appropriate to maintain individual endnotes as regards certain pesticides which are not listed in that control programme or which may require, in one or more Member States, a single-residue method in order to be analysed.\n(6) In order to ensure consistency and clarity, it is appropriate to replace Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 March 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0165, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC (OJ L\u00a0194, 25.7.2009, p.\u00a011).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (OJ L\u00a070, 16.3.2005, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nFeed and food of non-animal origin subject to an increased level of official controls at the designated point of entry\nFeed and food CN code\u00a0(1) TARIC sub-division Country of origin Hazard Frequency of physical and identity checks (%)\nDried grapes (vine fruit) 0806\u00a020  Afghanistan (AF) Ochratoxin A 50\n(Food)\n\u2014 Almonds, in shell\n\u2014\n\u2014 Almonds, shelled\n\u2014\n(Food)\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), in shell\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), shelled\n\u2014\n\u2014 Peanut butter\n\u2014\n\u2014 Groundnuts (peanuts), otherwise prepared or preserved\n\u2014 2008\u00a011\u00a091;\n(Feed and food)\n\u2014 Yardlong beans\n\u2014 ex\u00a00708\u00a020\u00a000;\n\u2014 Aubergines\n\u2014 0709\u00a030\u00a000;\n(Food \u2014 fresh, chilled or frozen vegetables)\nChinese celery (Apium graveolens) ex\u00a00709\u00a040\u00a000 20 Cambodia (KH) Pesticide residues\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(4) 50\n(Food \u2014 fresh or chilled herb)\nBrassica oleracea ex\u00a00704\u00a090\u00a090 40 China (CN) Pesticide residues\u00a0(2) 50\n(Food \u2014 fresh or chilled)\nTea, whether or not flavoured 0902  China (CN) Pesticide residues\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(6) 10\n(Food)\n\u2014 Aubergines\n\u2014 0709\u00a030\u00a000;\n\u2014 Bitter melon (Momordica charantia)\n\u2014 ex\u00a00709\u00a099\u00a090;\n(Food \u2014 fresh, chilled or frozen vegetables)\n\u2014 Yardlong beans\n\u2014 ex\u00a00708\u00a020\u00a000;\n\u2014 Peppers (sweet and other than sweet) (Capsicum spp.)\n\u2014 0709\u00a060\u00a010;\n\u2014 0710\u00a080\u00a051;\nStrawberries (fresh) 0810\u00a010\u00a000  Egypt (EG) Pesticide residues\u00a0(2)\n\u00a0(8) 10\n(Food)\nPeppers (sweet and other than sweet) (Capsicum spp.) 0709\u00a060\u00a010;
