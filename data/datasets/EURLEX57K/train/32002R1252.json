Such provisional authorisation may be given for a period up to four years in the case of additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to the Directive.\n(3) The assessment of the dossier submitted in respect of the preservative preparation described in the Annex to this Regulation shows that it satisfies all the conditions set by Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC and may therefore be authorised on a provisional basis for a four-year period.\n(4) The assessment of the dossier shows that certain procedures may be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives. Such protection should however be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(3).\n(5) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety of the preservative under the conditions described in the said Annex.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation belonging to the group \"Preservatives\" listed in the Annex to the present Regulation is authorised for use as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in the Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 July 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 297, 15.11.2001, p. 3.\n(3) OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\nANNEX\n\">TABLE>\""}
