When reference is made to the provisions of Articles 17, 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC this should be construed as the reference also to the similar provisions of Articles 7b, 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC.\n(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1), points (a), (b) and (c), Member States shall require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) by Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(3) Recital 76 of Directive 2009/28/EC states that the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry should be avoided and voluntary schemes can help create efficient solutions for proving compliance with these sustainability criteria.\n(4) The Commission may decide that a voluntary national or international scheme demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(3) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC or that a voluntary national or international scheme to measure greenhouse gas emission savings contains accurate data for the purposes of Article 17(2) of this Directive.\n(5) The Commission may recognise such a voluntary scheme for a period of five years.\n(6) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by that recognition decision, a Member State shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.\n(7) The \u2018Ensus voluntary scheme under RED for Ensus bioethanol production\u2019 (hereafter \u2018Ensus scheme\u2019) was submitted on 21 November 2011 to the Commission with the request for recognition. This scheme covers bioethanol from EU feed wheat produced by the Ensus One plant. The recognised scheme will be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC. The Commission will take into account considerations of commercial sensitivity and may decide to only partially publish the scheme.\n(8) Assessment of the Ensus scheme found it to adequately cover the sustainability criteria of Directive 2009/28/EC, as well as applying a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(9) The evaluation of the Ensus scheme found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and also complies with the methodological requirements in Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC,", "main_body": ["The voluntary scheme \u2018Ensus voluntary scheme under RED for Ensus bioethanol production\u2019 for which the request for recognition was submitted to the Commission on 21 November 2011 demonstrates that consignments of biofuels comply with the sustainability criteria as laid down in Article 17(3), 17(4) and 17(5) of Directive 2009/28/EC and Article 7b(3), 7b(4) and 7b(5) of Directive 98/70/EC.
