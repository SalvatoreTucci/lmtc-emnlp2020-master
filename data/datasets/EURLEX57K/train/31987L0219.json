For the purposes of this Directive, gas oil shall mean any petroleum product falling under subheading 27.10 C I of the Common Customs Tariff (10 December 1984 edition) or any petroleum product which, by reason of its distillation limits, falls into the category of middle distillates intended for use as fuel and of which at least 85 % by volume, including distillation losses, distils at 350 \u00b0C.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to gas oils:\n- used by shipping,\n- contained in the fuel tanks of inland waterway vessels or of motor vehicles travelling from one zone to another or crossing a frontier between a third country and a Member State,\n- intended for processing in the refining industry.", "1. Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that gas oils can be marketed in the Community only if their sulphur compound content, expressed in sulphur, does not exceed 0,3 % by weight as from 1 January 1989.\n2. Should environmental requirements or the state of desulphurization technology change appreciably or should the economic situation in the Community as regards the supply of crude oil change substantially, the Commission may, on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, propose amendments in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Treaty, to the sulphur content indicated in paragraph 1.\n3. If, as the result of a sudden change in the supply of crude oil or petroleum products, it becomes difficult for a Member State to apply the limit on the maximum sulphur content of gas oil, that Member State may, after informing the Commission, authorize a higher limit within its territory for a period of four months. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend this period.'\n(2) Articles 4 to 7 are replaced by the following:\n'Article 4\nWithout prejudice to Article 5, the Member States may not, as from the date of application laid down in Article 2, due account being taken of Article 3, prohibit, restrict or impede the marketing of gas oils, on the grounds of sulphur content, provided they comply with the requirements of this Directive.", "1. Member States may require the use of gas oils with a sulphur content equal to 0,2 % by weight:\n- within the zones they have determined under Article 4 of Council Directive 80/779/EEC of 15 July 1980 on air quality limit values and guide values for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates (1); as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,\n- wherever Article 5 of the same Directive is applicable,\n- where damage to the environment or to the national heritage caused by total sulphur dioxide emissions requires the sulphur content of gas oil to be fixed at a lower value than that provided for in Article 2.\n2. Member States shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of any measures which they contemplate taking in respect of paragraph 1 and of their grounds for taking them.\nMarketing of any gas oil with a sulphur content of less than 0,2 % may not be prohibited.", "The Commission shall monitor the effects of applying this Directive.\nThree years at the latest after the notification (2) of this Directive, in the light of any new information available on the atmospheric sulphur dioxide pollution levels recorded, on progress towards defining air quality objectives, on the state of the environment and on the harmful effects of air pollution, and on condition on the gas oil market, the Commission shall submit a report to the Council accompanied by an appropriate proposal with a view to the establishment of a single value.\nThe Council, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, shall decide on the Commission proposal before 1 December 1991.", "1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to check by sampling the sulphur content of gas oils which are marketed.\n2. The reference method adopted for determining the sulphur content of gas oils which are marketed is defined by method IP 336. The statistical interpretation of the results of the checks made to determine the sulphur content of the gas oils marketed shall be made according to standard ISO 4259 (1979 edition).\n(1) OJ No L 229, 30. 8. 1980, p. 30.\n(2) This Directive was notified to the Member States on 2 April 1987.'
