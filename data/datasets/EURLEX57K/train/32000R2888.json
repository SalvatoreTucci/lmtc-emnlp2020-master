That decision accompanied the introduction of the RPLP (heavy traffic levy) on the Swiss network.\n(2) That decision is an autonomous measure taken by the Swiss Confederation and, as a result, it cannot be deemed to be a provisional application of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road signed on 21 June 1999. The conclusion of that Agreement by the Community calls for the simultaneous entry into force of the seven agreements signed on the same date with the Swiss Confederation.\n(3) It is necessary to establish on a lasting basis rules governing the distribution and management of the permits made available to the Community as from 1 January 2001.\n(4) For practical and organisational reasons, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of distributing the permits to Member States.\n(5) To that end, an allocation method should be established. Thereafter, Member States should share out the permits allocated to them among transport undertakings with reference to objective criteria.\n(6) In order to ensure the optimal use of permits, all unallocated permits should be returned to the Commission for redistribution.\n(7) The allocation of permits should be based on criteria that take full account of existing freight transport flows and genuine transport needs across the Alpine region.\n(8) It may prove necessary to revise the allocation of permits on the basis of genuine traffic flows, while taking account of relevant items of the method described in Annex III. In carrying out such revision, the Commission should be assisted by a Committee.\n(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4),", "main_body": ["This Regulation lays down the rules for the distribution of permits allocated to the Community by Switzerland allowing heavy goods vehicles of up to 34 tonnes to travel on its territory as from 1 January 2001, opening up, from the same date, the quotas for vehicles the actual total laden weight of which is more than 34 tonnes but not more than 40 tonnes and for empty and light goods vehicles and introducing the RPLP (heavy traffic levy) on the Swiss network.", "For the purposes of this Regulation:\n1. \u2018full-weight\u2019 permit shall mean a permit to travel on Swiss territory granted for goods vehicles the actual total laden weight of which is more than 34 tonnes but not more than 40 tonnes;\n2. \u2018empty\u2019 permit shall mean a permit to travel on Swiss territory granted for goods vehicles that are empty or are transporting light loads.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall allocate permits in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018full-weight\u2019 permits shall be distributed in accordance with Annex I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018empty\u2019 permits shall be distributed in accordance with Annex II.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The permits for each year shall be distributed before 15 August of the preceding year.", "Member States shall distribute permits amongst the undertakings established in their territory according to objective and non-discriminatory criteria.", "Before 15 September each year, Member States shall transfer to the Commission those permits which have not been allocated to undertakings.\nIn accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 7, the Commission shall allocate those permits to one or more Member States in such a way as to ensure an optimal use thereof.", "When the Commission makes its proposal for adjustment, it shall take as a basis actual traffic flows during 2001, while seeing to it that equal account is taken of criteria relating to bilateral traffic operations and transit traffic operations.
