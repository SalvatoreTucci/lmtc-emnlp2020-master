The ERC is to succeed the European Research Council which was set up by Commission Decision 2007/134/EC\u00a0(3) in order to implement Council Decision 2006/972/EC\u00a0(4) (hereinafter referred to as the Specific Programme Ideas). The ERC is to be composed of an independent Scientific Council (hereinafter referred to as the ERC Scientific Council) and a dedicated implementation structure in the form of an executive agency.\n(4) The delegation of tasks related to programme implementation to an executive agency requires clear separation between the programming stages, this being established by the ERC Scientific Council and adopted by the Commission, and programme implementation according to the principles and methodology established by the ERC Scientific Council, which should be entrusted to the executive agency.\n(5) By Decision 2008/37/EC\u00a0(5), the Commission created the European Research Council Executive Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) and entrusted it with the management of Community actions in the field of frontier research with a view to perform the task of implementing the Specific Programme Ideas.\n(6) The Agency set up by Decision 2008/37/EC has demonstrated that it has attained a significant reputation within the scientific community across Europe and worldwide. It has established itself as an essential component of the Union\u2019s research funding landscape with good visibility and external perception by stakeholders. The external evaluation of the Agency carried out in accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that the setting up of the Agency has been beneficial as a result of its scientific specialisation and ability to provide a better service in terms of being close to the beneficiaries, improving the communication and visibility of programmes and ensuring quicker payment to beneficiaries. Savings resulting from the delegation of tasks to the Agency have been estimated at some EUR 45 million over the period 2009-2012.\n(7) In its Communication of 29 June 2011\u2018A budget for Europe 2020\u2019\u00a0(6), the Commission proposed to use the option of more extensive recourse to existing executive agencies for the implementation of Union programmes in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework.\n(8) The cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that the Commission should entrust the Agency with the implementation of the specific objective \u2018strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council\u2019 of Part I \u2018Excellent science\u2019 of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020. The Agency has high quality programme management and service delivery, visibility and existing communication outreach channels which have proved effective. The specific objective \u2018strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council\u2019 is in line with the current objectives and tasks of the Agency. Making use of the accumulated experience and expertise of the Agency would lead to efficiency gains. Moreover, the Commission has never managed this programme internally and consequently there would be an interruption in business continuity and a lack of know-how. In addition, efficiency gains of EUR 79 million over the period 2014-2024 are to be expected by implementing the agency scenario compared to the in-house scenario where the programme would be managed by the Commission.\n(9) The Agency should be entrusted with the management of the specific objective \u2018strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council\u2019 of Part I \u2018Excellent science\u2019 of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020, pursuing similar activities which under the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework are already managed by the Agency and which are characterised by projects which do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of scientific and financial expertise throughout the project cycle.\n(10) The Agency should continue the implementation of the Specific Programme Ideas which was delegated to it under the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework.\n(11) In order to ensure a consistent implementation in time of this Decision and of the programmes concerned, it is necessary to ensure that the Agency shall exercise its tasks linked to the implementation of those programmes subject to and from the date on which those programmes enter into force.\n(12) The Agency should be established. It should replace and succeed the executive agency established by Decision 2008/37/EC. It should operate in accordance with the general statute laid down by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.\n(13) Decision 2008/37/EC should therefore be repealed and transitional provisions should be set out.\n(14) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Establishment\nThe European Research Council Executive Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) is hereby established and shall replace and succeed the executive agency set up by Decision 2008/37/EC from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2024, its statute being governed by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Brussels.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency shall be the dedicated implementation structure of the European Research Council, responsible for the administrative implementation and programme execution.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Agency is hereby entrusted, within the framework of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020 \u2014 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020), with the implementation of the specific objective \u2018strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council\u2019 of Part I \u2018Excellent science\u2019.
