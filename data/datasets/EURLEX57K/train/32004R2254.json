Hence, there is still a need to facilitate the development of the organic livestock production.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2277/2003\u00a0(2), which amended Annexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, extended the transitional period for bringing conventional animals into the organic farming system until 31 December 2004. However, this extension has proved not to be sufficient in particular in the case of poultry production, which comprises different stages where different specialised sectors are involved.\n(3) There is, therefore, still a need for reliance on non-organically reared animals. The provisions on the origin of the animals should be adapted accordingly.\n(4) Although it is already possible to reinforce the provisions on the origin of pullets for egg production, production standards for these animals have not been harmonised yet. Until such standards are established, it is appropriate to permit bringing non-organically reared pullets for egg production of not more than 18 weeks into an organic livestock unit when organically reared pullets are not available, under certain conditions applying prior to bringing these animals into the organic farming system.\n(5) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Considering the urgency of the measure due to the fact that certain provisions on the origin of animals expire on 31 December 2004, this Regulation should enter into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 December 2004.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.
