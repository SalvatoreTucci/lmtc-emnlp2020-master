A small plate for an interchangeable tool, consisting of a compact layer of synthetic diamond permanently attached to a metal carbide substrate.\n2. A colour monitor, capable of accepting a signal only from the central processing unit of an automatic data processing machine. The monitor is not capable of reproducing a colour image from a composite video signal.\n3. Keyboard for an automatic data processing machine, in its own housing. This input unit does not have its own electrical supply and has to be attached, by its connecting cable, to the central processing unit of an automatic data processing machine to function.\n4. Heating strips for self-regulation of the temperature of fluids, consisting of a copper conductor with a cross-section of 1,9 mm2, a self-regulating conducting filament, a fluoropolymer insulating sleeve, a tinned copper braid with a cross-section of 2,8 mm2 and an outer fluoropolymer sleeve covering the braid. The beating strip varies the heating power at each point of the circuit with which it is associated depending upon the temperature it encounters. It is generally intended to be wrapped around piping.\n5. Optical reading heads for compact disc players, consisting of a laser diode and a photodiode, contained in a metal housing with not more than 10 connecting pins.\n6.
