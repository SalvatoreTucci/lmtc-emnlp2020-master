By Decision of 24 October 2006, the Council accordingly decided that there were no grounds for such an extension. The transitional period will therefore come to an end on 30 April 2007.\n(4) However, Article 3 of the said Regulation stipulates that, at the end of the transitional period, all acts which at that time have not already been published in the Maltese language are also to be published in that language; it would nevertheless appear to be very difficult for all those acts to be translated and published immediately after 30 April 2007. Article 3 should therefore be amended in order to give the institutions a further space of time to enable them to absorb the backlog of all the acts that will not have been published in Maltese by the end of the transitional period,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 930/2004 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 3\nAll acts which have not been published in Maltese by 30 April 2007 will also be published in that language by 31 December 2008 at the latest.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 November 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
