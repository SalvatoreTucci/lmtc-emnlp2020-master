Those attestations are recognised as equivalent to the certificate provided for in Article 117 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(2) It is the responsibility of the agencies concerned in those third countries to keep the information provided in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1295/2008 up to date and to communicate that information to the Commission in a spirit of close cooperation.\n(3) Croatia and Serbia have undertaken to comply with the requirements set for the marketing of hops and hop products and have authorised an agency to issue attestations of equivalence. Those attestations should therefore be recognised as equivalent to Community certificates and the products covered by them admitted to free circulation.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 1295/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1295/2008 is hereby replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 1 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 340, 19.12.2008, p. 45.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nAGENCIES AUTHORISED TO ISSUE ATTESTATIONS IN RESPECT OF\nHop cones CN code: ex\u00a01210\nHop powders CN code: ex\u00a01210\nSaps and extracts of hops CN code: 1302\u00a013\u00a000\nCountry of origin Authorised agencies Address Code Telephone Fax e-mail (optional)\nMacquarie Wharf No 1\nHunter Street, Hobart\nTasmania 7000\nFloor 2, West Wing 59,\nCamelot Drive\nNapean, Ontario,\nK1A OY9\nNo. 33 Youyi Road,\nHexi District\nTianjin 300201\nNo. 8, Zhaofaxincun\n2nd Avenue, TEDA\nTianjin 300457\nNo. 12 Erdos Street,\nSaihan District, Huhhot City\nInner Mongolia 010020\nNo. 116 North Nanhu Road\nUrumqi City\nXinjiang 830063\nMilislava Demerca 1,\nHR-48260 Kri\u017eevci\nNew Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries PO Box 2526 Wellington (64-4) 472-0367 47\u00a044\u00a024\nGawthorn Institute Private Bag Nelson (64-3) 548\u00a023\u00a019 546\u00a094\u00a064\n21000 Novi Sad\nMaksima Gorkog 30.\nPO Box 395\n0001 Pretoria\nEngimattstrasse 11\nPostfach 353\nCH-8027 Z\u00fcrich\nHlebnaja 27\n262028 Zhtiomie\n21 N. 1st Ave. Suite 106\nYakima, WA 98902\n2270 Old Penitentiary Road\nP.O.
