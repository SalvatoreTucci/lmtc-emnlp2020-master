A budgetary ceiling for the specific support referred to in Chapter 5 of Title III of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 has been established for each of those years accordingly.\n(3) In July 2012, Greece has decided to also make use of the option provided for in Article 69(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for the year 2013. However, due to a misunderstanding concerning the notification of such decision, the amounts to be fixed for the purpose of the budgetary ceiling for 2013 have not been included in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013.\n(4) Given that Greece decided to continue implementing the specific support in calendar year 2013 without any change in the amounts notified by Greece for financing the support measures concerned as they were implemented in the year 2012, the budgetary ceiling should be fixed for that year.\n(5) For the sake of clarity, the ceiling resulting from the amounts allocated by Greece for the measures concerned in 2013 should be published.\n(6) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 929/2013\u00a0(3) amended the national ceilings for 2013 determined in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards Luxembourg and Malta. Annex V to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) In accordance with the sixth subparagraph of Article 51(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Croatia notified the Commission of its decision to use a certain percentage of the ceilings fixed in Articles 104(4) and 112(5) of that Regulation for the sheep and goats payments and the beef and veal payments respectively. Therefore, the relevant budgetary ceilings for the sheep and goat premium, the sheep and goat supplementary premium and the suckler cow premium should be established.\n(8) In accordance with Article 69(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Croatia decided before the date of its accession to use the specific support provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(ii) of that Regulation in the dairy sector and communicated its decision to the Commission. The decision is in compliance with the limit set in Article 69(4) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. The relevant ceiling should be established by the Commission.\n(9) Croatia applies the single payment scheme provided for under Title III of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. For the sake of clarity, the budgetary ceiling for the single payment scheme for Croatia, resulting from the deduction of the ceilings established for the payments referred to in Articles 52, 53 and 68 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 from the ceilings set in Annex VIII to that Regulation, should be published for 2013.\n(10) Annexes I to V to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Annexes I to V to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 September 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013 of 23 September 2013 establishing budgetary ceilings for 2013 applicable to certain direct support schemes provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (OJ L 252, 24.9.2013, p. 14).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 929/2013 of 26 September 2013 amending Annex VIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy (OJ L 255, 27.9.2013, p. 5).\nANNEX\nAnnexes I to V to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 914/2013 are replaced by the following:\nANNEX I\nBudgetary ceilings for direct payments to be granted in accordance with Articles 52, 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\n2013 calendar year\n(thousand EUR)\nBE ES FR HR AT PT FI\nSheep and goat premium    1\u00a0192  21\u00a0892 600\nSheep and goat supplementary premium    117  7\u00a0184 200\nSuckler cow premium 77\u00a0565 261\u00a0153 525\u00a0622 2\u00a0948 70\u00a0578 78\u00a0695\nAdditional suckler cow premium 19\u00a0389 26\u00a0000   99 9\u00a0462\nANNEX II\nBudgetary ceilings for the specific support provided for in Article 68(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\n2013 calendar year\nMember State (thousand EUR)\nBelgium 8\u00a0600\nBulgaria 28\u00a0500\nCzech Republic 31\u00a0826\nDenmark 40\u00a0975\nEstonia 1\u00a0253\nIreland 25\u00a0000\nGreece 108\u00a0000\nSpain 248\u00a0054\nFrance 478\u00a0600\nCroatia 4\u00a0660\nItaly 321\u00a0950\nLatvia 5\u00a0130\nLithuania 13\u00a0304\nHungary 131\u00a0898\nNetherlands 38\u00a0900\nAustria 13\u00a0900\nPoland 106\u00a0558\nPortugal 34\u00a0111\nRomania 44\u00a0257\nSlovenia 14\u00a0424\nSlovakia 13\u00a0500\nFinland 57\u00a0055\nSweden 3\u00a0469\nUnited Kingdom 29\u00a0800\nAmounts notified by the Member States to grant the support referred to in point (c) of Article 68(1) which are included in the single payment scheme ceiling (thousand EUR).\nANNEX III\nBudgetary ceilings for the support provided for in points (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Article 68(1)(a) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\n2013 calendar year\nMember State (thousand EUR)\nBelgium 4\u00a0461\nBulgaria 28\u00a0500\nCzech Republic 31\u00a0826\nDenmark 17\u00a0075\nEstonia 1\u00a0253\nIreland 25\u00a0000\nGreece 78\u00a0000\nSpain 179\u00a0954\nFrance 297\u00a0600\nCroatia 4\u00a0660\nItaly 152\u00a0950\nLatvia 5\u00a0130\nLithuania 13\u00a0304\nHungary 46\u00a0164\nNetherlands 31\u00a0420\nAustria 13\u00a0900\nPoland 106\u00a0558\nPortugal 21\u00a0210\nRomania 44\u00a0257\nSlovenia 8\u00a0624\nSlovakia 13\u00a0500\nFinland 57\u00a0055\nSweden 3\u00a0469\nUnited Kingdom 29\u00a0800\nANNEX IV\nAmounts to be used by the Member States in accordance with Article 69(6)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to cover the specific support provided in Article 68(1) of that Regulation\n2013 calendar year\nMember State (thousand EUR)\nBelgium 8\u00a0600\nDenmark 23\u00a0250\nIreland 23\u00a0900\nGreece 70\u00a0000\nSpain 144\u00a0390\nFrance 84\u00a0000\nItaly 144\u00a0900\nNetherlands 31\u00a0700\nAustria 11\u00a0900\nPortugal 21\u00a0700\nSlovenia 5\u00a0800\nFinland 6\u00a0190\nANNEX V\nBudgetary ceilings for the single payment scheme\n2013 calendar year\nMember State (thousand EUR)\nBelgium 517\u00a0901\nDenmark 1\u00a0031\u00a0277\nGermany 5\u00a0852\u00a0938\nIreland 1\u00a0339\u00a0769\nGreece 2\u00a0225\u00a0227\nSpain 4\u00a0913\u00a0824\nFrance 7\u00a0607\u00a0272\nCroatia 86\u00a0007\nItaly 4\u00a0202\u00a0935\nLuxembourg 37\u00a0672\nMalta 5\u00a0504\nNetherlands 890\u00a0551\nAustria 679\u00a0111\nPortugal 476\u00a0907\nSlovenia 141\u00a0450\nFinland 518\u00a0883\nSweden 767\u00a0437\nUnited Kingdom 3\u00a0958\u00a0242"}
