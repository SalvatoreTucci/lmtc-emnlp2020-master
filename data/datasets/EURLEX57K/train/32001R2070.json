In order that the eligible quantity reflects as closely as possible the actual production of the producers concerned, the Member State must also take account of other objective factors at the time of fixing that quantity. The number of olive trees in question, the yield fixed for the homogeneous zone concerned and a coefficient taking account of the difference, at national level, between the production resulting from the estimate of yields and the effective production fixed by the Commission in accordance with Article 17a(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 constitute such criteria and must therefore be incorporated into the calculation of the eligible quantity.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 is amended as follows:\n1.
