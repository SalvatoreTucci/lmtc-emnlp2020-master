whereas these countries have adopted national population programmes;\n(2) Whereas the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 adopted a programme of action;\n(3) Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 11 November 1986 concerning population and development and that of 18 November 1992 concerning family planning and cooperation with the developing countries, recognized the urgent need to satisfy unmet demand for family-planning services, at the same time stressing the need to help the developing countries implement broad-based population programmes encompassing all the different factors determining control over fertility;\n(4) Whereas the European Parliament hearing of 25 November 1993 highlighted the complex relationship between population and development; whereas, up to a point, population growth may promote economic development; whereas, however, the very high rates of growth observed in a number of developing countries make it impossible to satisfy the needs thus generated and to open up prospects for sustainable development, notably as far as the environment is concerned;\n(5) Whereas a more moderate demographic development would be promoted through the following:\n- a fairer distribution of income among different groups in a society,\n- an economic policy which makes it possible for poor women and men to develop a diversified livelihood,\n- investments in infrastructure with importance to people's health, such as clean water, improved sewerage systems and acceptable housing,\n- a health policy which improves the access to health services for the poor, and\n- improved access and quality for general education and training for women and girls;\n(6) Whereas a number of developing countries have entered a phase of demographic transition characterized by a significant reduction in the fertility rate, which points at a change in attitude conducive to a reduction in family size; whereas other developing countries have not entered this phase and should therefore receive special assistance;\n(7) Whereas individual freedom of choice for women, men and, in particular, adolescents through adequate access to information and services in matters concerning their reproductive rights is a significant element of progress and development;\n(8) Whereas the Community has been helping to finance specific measures and pilot schemes in pursuit of these objectives since 1990; whereas it is time for the Community to step up its cooperation in this particular area, in accordance with the programme of action of the said Cairo International Conference;\n(9) Whereas the Community upholds the right of individuals to decide on the number and spacing of their children; whereas it denounces any violation of human rights in the form of compulsory abortion, compulsory sterilization, infanticide, rejection, abandonment and abuse inflicted on unwanted children as a means of curbing population growth;\n(10) Whereas no support is to be given under this Regulation to incentives to encourage sterilization or abortion nor to the improper testing of contraception methods in developing countries;\n(11) Whereas the Community has undertaken to follow up the aforementioned Cairo International Conference, notably by increasing its financial support for population programmes in the developing countries;\n(12) Whereas, when cooperation measures are implemented, the decision adopted at the Cairo International Conference, according to which abortion can never be promoted as a family-planning method, has to be rigorously observed;\n(13) Whereas the recipient countries must be helped to introduce population programmes that are compatible with sustainable development and to develop strategies aimed at giving women the power to decide and achieving equality between women and men, which are determining factors in enabling women to exercise choice over child-bearing, uptake of family planning and control over their own reproductive health, through measures in a variety of social, economic and cultural sectors, and in particular the key sectors of education and health;\n(14) Whereas, to be truly effective, such population programmes must be part of an overall policy to combat poverty and counter the threats on the environment;\n(15) Whereas new operations of this kind will be effective only if they are accompanied by sustainable development enabling the harmonious and progressive integration of the developing countries into the world economy;\n(16) Whereas non-governmental organizations and private operators can play an essential role in ensuring the success of health, education and family-planning policies, in particular among women, who are central to any sustainable human development policy, and adolescents;\n(17) Whereas the measures taken under this Regulation are to be funded by grants from the general budget of the European Communities;\n(18) Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995, is included in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty;\n(19) Whereas administrative rules and procedures must be laid down for cooperation in this field,", "main_body": ["The Community shall conduct cooperation in support of population policies and programmes in the developing countries.", "Measures taken under this Regulation shall be directed primarily at those countries which are furthest away from the criteria defined by the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, at the poorest and least developed countries and at the most disadvantaged sections of the population of developing countries.", "The assistance provided under this Regulation shall complement and reinforce assistance provided under other instruments of development cooperation in the education and health sectors with a view to taking population issues fully into account and to integrating them in Community programmes.", "1.
