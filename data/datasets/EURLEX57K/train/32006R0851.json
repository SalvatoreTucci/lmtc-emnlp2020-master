For any given infrastructure, the expenditure to be taken into account under the various headings in the forms of accounts shall be the total expenditure incurred in respect of that infrastructure, irrespective of how the expenditure is financed.\n\u2014 infrastructure expenditure (Council Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70\u00a0(1), Article 3(1)(b)),\n\u2014 payments in respect of retirement and other pensions (Council Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69\u00a0(2), Article 4(1)(c), Class III).\n3.
