whereas most of the quantitative restrictions relating to products originating in that country were abolished pursuant to Article 15 of the Cooperation Agreement between the Community and that country signed in Belgrade on 2 April 1980 (5);\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/82 of 30 June 1982 on common rules for imports from State-trading countries (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1434/90 (7), provides that imports of the products listed in its Annex are not subject to any quantitative restrictions;\nWhereas at the Ministerial meeting of the Group of 24 Western nations (G-24) on 4 July 1990 the Community established that the conditions were met in certain Central and East European countries for the extension of the aid for the reconstruction of their economies;\nWhereas in order to contribute to the modernization of the economic fabric of the countries concerned, primarily by means of an increase in their exports, specific quantitative restrictions should be lifted, namely the restrictions applied in each region of the Commnity to imports originating in each of the countries to which Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 applies, other than imports subject to quantitative restrictions by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 288/82, and the remaining quantitative restrictions, termed 'non-specific', which apply to the release for free circulation within the Community of certain products originating in these countries, should be suspended; whereas the Community has already taken steps of this kind for Poland and Hungary within the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3381/89 (8) and Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89;\nWhereas as regards non-specific quantitative restrictions it would be appropriate to allow suspension, the aim of which is to allow the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to integrate themselves more rapidly into international economic life, to continue for the period needed for economic restructuring; whereas a period ending on 31 December 1991 seems suitable for the present; whereas a suspension lasting until 31 December 1990 for products originating in Poland and Hungary was introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89; whereas it therefore seems appropriate to extend this suspension until 31 December 1991 in order to make its expiry coincide with that for products originating in other countries;\nWhereas a blanket suspension of all quantitative restrictions for an unlimited period has been introduced for the German Democratic Republic from 1 July 1990 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1794/90 (9) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1759/90 (10);\nWhereas in the case of textile products it is important to align the trade arrangements for these countries of Central and Eastern Europe on those for all the other countries with which the Community has negotiated bilateral textile agreements; whereas it is therefore necessary to exclude outward processing traffic (OPT) involving these products from the liberalization measures provided for in this Regulation;\nWher    these liberalization measures must remain compatible with the economic situation in certain particularly sensitive sectors of Community production; whereas it should be possible to restore some of these restrictions while observing the relevant procedures and rules, in order to remedy adverse situations which might\narise in the Community; whereas in the light of the provisions of the Act of Accession (Articles 177 and 364), provision should be made that the non-specific quantitative restrictions should not be suspended by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic,", "main_body": ["Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 shall be replaced by the following:\n'1. The placing in free circulation of the products listed in Annex III originating in State-trading countries shall be subject to quantitative restrictions in the Member States as indicated in that Annex against those products.\nHowever, the only quantitative restrictions which the Member States may maintain with regard to Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and Romania are the restrictions on the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 288/82. Application of such quantitative restrictions to the placing into free circulation of products originating in these countries, except the German Democratic Republic, is nonetheless suspended until 31 December 1991 in the Member States, apart from Spain and Portugal. This suspension shall not apply to textile products reimported into the Community after processing or working in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania or, after 1 January 1991, in Poland or Hungary. Should imports of such products cause or threaten to cause economic difficulties in the Community or a region of the Community, the appropriate quantitative restriction may be re-introduced in accordance with the rules provided for in Title IV.'", "Regulation (EEC) No 288/82 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
