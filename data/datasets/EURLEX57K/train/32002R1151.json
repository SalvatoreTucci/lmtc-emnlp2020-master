The Council approved the abovementioned Protocol on behalf of the Community by Decision 1999/86/EC(3).\n(3) Improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement were also provided for, in the form of an autonomous and transitional measure pending a second adjustment of the relevant provisions of the Europe Agreement, as a result of a first round of negotiations to liberalise the agricultural trade. The improvements entered into force as from 1 July 2000 by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 1349/2000 of 19 June 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia(4). The second adjustment of the relevant provisions in the Europe Agreement - which will take the form of another Additional Protocol thereto - has not yet entered into force.\n(4) A new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement on trade liberalisation for agricultural products has been negotiated.\n(5) A swift implementation of the adjustments forms an essential part of the results of the negotiations for the conclusion of a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement.\n(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).\n(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(6) codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Tariff quotas under this Regulation should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules.\n(8) As a result of the aforementioned negotiations, Regulation (EC) No 1349/2000 has effectively lost its substance and should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["1. The arrangements for import into the Community applicable to certain agricultural products originating in Estonia as set out in Annex C(a) and Annex C(b) to this Regulation shall replace those set out in Annex Va to the Europe Agreement.\n2.

favoured nation duty)\n>TABLE>\nAppendix to Annex C(b)\nMinimum import price arrangement for certain soft fruit for processing\n1. Minimum import prices are fixed as follows for the following products for processing originating in Estonia:\n>TABLE>\n2. The minimum import prices, as set out in point 1, will be respected on a consignment by consignment basis. Where a customs declaration value is lower than the minimum import price, a countervailing duty will be charged equal to the difference between the minimum import price and the customs declaration value.\n3. If the import prices of a given product covered by this Appendix show a trend suggesting that the prices could go below the level of the minimum import prices in the immediate future, the Commission of the European Communities will inform the Estonian authorities in order to enable them to correct the situation.\n4. At the request of either the Community or Estonia, the Association Council shall examine the functioning of the system or the revision of the level of the minimum import prices. If appropriate, the Association Council shall take the necessary decisions.\n5. To encourage and promote the development of trade and for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned, a consultation meeting may be organised three months before the beginning of each marketing year in the Community. This consultation meeting will take place between the Commission of the European Communities and the interested European producers' organisations for the products concerned, of the one part, and the authorities', producers' and exporters' organisations of all the associated exporting countries, of the other part.\nDuring this consultation meeting, the market situation for soft fruit including, in particular, forecasts for production, stock situation, price evolution and possible market development, as well as possibilities to adapt supply to demand, will be discussed."}
