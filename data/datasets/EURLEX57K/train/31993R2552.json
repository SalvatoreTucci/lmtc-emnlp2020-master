No residual anti-dumping duties were imposed at that time since, in particular, the USSR and Chinese exporters, which actually gave the undertakings, held a monopoly on exports  of the product concerned from their countries.\n(2) Subsequently, the USSR exporter, V/O Stankoimport, lost its monopoly on exports. Exports are now carried out by a number of new exporters, located in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. As far as China is concerned, undertakings were accepted from  six trade organizations authorized by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to export this product from China. The Commission has now found that exports are being made from China by other exporters and trade organizations previously unknown to the Commission.  It has also been established that exports of artificial corundum from China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine have taken place in substantial quantities and at prices well below the undertaking prices.\n(3) The effect of this development is that the existing measures for China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine have become ineffective. Furthermore, the current situation discriminates against the exporters which undertook not to sell artificial  corundum below certain price levels and thus to eliminate the injurious effect of dumping.\n(4) The Council, therefore, considers that the facts as outlined above now require the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty, on the basis of the findings set out in Decision 91/512/EEC which the Council still considers valid, on imports of  artificial corundum originating in the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Council further considers that the findings of the investigation carried out prior to its adoption remain reliable and that duties may therefore  still be based on them. The exporters which had undertakings accepted and respected their provisions should continue to be exempt from the anti-dumping duty.\n(5) Consequently, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the rates corresponding to those established in the above investigation, i.e. 30,8 % in respect of the People's Republic of China and 9,8 % in respect of the Russian Federation and  Ukraine.\n(6) Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 provides for measures to lapse after five years from the date on which they entered into force or were last modified or confirmed. Although the measures provided for by this Regulation imposing  definitive anti-dumping duties are linked to the undertakings accepted by Decision 91/512/EEC, this Regulation does not amend or confirm the latter within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 and consequently the date on which  the undertakings were due to expire pursuant to Article 15 (1) remains unchanged,", "main_body": ["1.
