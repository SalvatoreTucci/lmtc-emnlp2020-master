whereas the derogation therefore also relates to such transactions;\nWhereas, by taking the open market value as the taxable amount for certain supplies, the proposed measure derogates from Article 11 (A) (1) (a) of the said Directive, which provides that the taxable amount for supplies of goods is to be everything which constitutes the consideration which has been or is to be obtained by the supplier from the purchaser or a third party for such supplies, including subsidies directly linked to the price of such supplies;\nWhereas the derogation is aimed at preventing the tax avoidance which takes place when the contracting parties agree on an abnormally low price for the establishment of rights in rem, which attracts VAT, and compensation for this price in the form of a high price for the freehold sale of the property, which is exempt from VAT;\nWhereas the special measure is to apply only in cases where the administration is able to prove that the taxable amount determined in accordance with Article 11 (A) (1) (a) of the said Directive is abnormally low; whereas the administration may not act on mere presumptions, and the parties concerned must be allowed to adduce evidence to the contrary where they dispute the level of the open market value established by the administration;\nWhereas, given the limited scope of the derogation, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued;\nWhereas the authorization is granted temporarily, thereby enabling the effects of the measure to be assessed once it has been applied for a certain period of time;\nWhereas the derogation in question has no adverse impact on the European Community's own resources accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 11 (A) (1) (a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Netherlands is hereby authorized to take the open market value, as defined in Article 11 (A) (1) (d) of the said Directive, as the taxable amount for the establishment of rights in rem in respect of buildings or parts thereof and the land on which they stand, considered to be tangible property in pursuance of Article 5 (3) of that Directive, where the following two conditions are met:\n- the taxable amount determined in accordance with Article 11 (A) (1) (a) of the Directive is abnormally low in comparison with the price that could be obtained for the property in a transaction between independent parties operating at arm's length,\n- the party acquiring the rights in rem is a non-taxable legal person or a taxable person carrying on exempted activities that do not entitle him to deduct VAT.", "This authorization shall be granted until 31 December 1998.", "This Decision is addressed to the Netherlands."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 July 1996.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.
