regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Article 7 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 of 15 December 1994 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1),\nWhereas Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 states that without prejudice to Article 4 (8) and unless the substances are intended for destruction by a technology approved by the parties, for feedstock use in the manufacture of other chemicals or for quarantine and preshipment (for methyl bromide only), the release for free circulation in the Community of the chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, the other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methyl bromide and hydrobromofluorocarbons, imported from third countries shall be subject to quantitative limits and that these limits may be modified pursuant to Article 7 (3);\nWhereas any increase of these quantitative limits may not lead to a Community consumption of controlled substances beyond the quantitative limits established according to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer;\nWhereas the Commission is required under Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16, to allocate quotas to undertakings that request import quotas;\nWhereas the Commission has published a notice to importers in the European Community of controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer (2), regarding the same Regulation and has thereby received applications for import quotas;\nWhereas the applications for the import quotas of the chlorofluorocarbones 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, the other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methyl bromide and hydrobromofluorocarbons exceed the import quotas available for allocation under Article 7 (2);\nWhereas the Commission cannot fully satisfy the applications and has to allocate import quotas to the applicants, taking primarily the different environmental impact of the potential imports, the individual background of the applicants in importing the respective substances and the amounts applied for into consideration;\nWhereas some companies which have applied for an import quota for 1995 have not imported any of these substances before, while others imported large quantities of substances in the reference year and/or in the following years;\nWhereas the applications from some companies substantially exceed the quantities imported by them in previous years;\nWhereas some of the applications from the procedures of ODS in the Community have been made for specific contingency purposes of possible breakdown of production, technical failure and non-availability of the substances in the Community;\nWhereas the allocations of the individual quotas to the applicants must be based on the principles of continuity, equality and proportionality;\nWhereas for methyl bromide the import quotas are allocated to the primary importers, considered by the Commission to be the importers who deal directly by way of invoicing with the producers outside the Community;\nWhereas for methyl bromide the procedure by which the primary importers are in receipt of the import quotas shall be the subject of a second review during 1996 to establish whether individual Member States continue to consider the system to be equitable in practice;\nWhereas for methyl bromide a reserve of 283,07 ODP tonnes is retained for allocation to importers, not previously classified as primary importers and the allocations are to be made in accordance with Article 16 procedure;\nWhereas imports of virgin substances and of substances for possible dispersive uses are potentially more harmful to the environment than imports of reclaimed or recovered substances to be used as feedstock for the production of other substances;\nWhereas import licences shall be issued in accordance with Article 6 of the abovementioned Regulation, after verification of compliance by the importer with Articles 7, 8 and 12;\nWhereas an increase of these quantitative limits for the import of used and recycled substances and of substances to be used as a feedstock for the production of other substances does not cause any additional harm to the environment;\nWhereas the release into free circulation in the Community of the abovementioned substances imported from non-parties is prohibited in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation;\nWhereas Article 16 of the same Regulation sets out the procedure according to which decisions can be taken concerning the implementation of the Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee referred to in Article 16 of the same Regulation,", "main_body": ["1.
