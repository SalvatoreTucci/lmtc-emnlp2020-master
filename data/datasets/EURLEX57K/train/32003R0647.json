The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.\n(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavour or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.\n(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.\n(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.\n(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.\n(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.\n(8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.\n(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The refunds to be granted on exports of the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, non-denatured and without further processing, are hereby fixed in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 11 April 2003.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 April 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26.\n(3) OJ L 214, 8.9.1995, p. 16.\nANNEX\nREFUNDS ON WHITE SUGAR AND RAW SUGAR EXPORTED WITHOUT FURTHER PROCESSING\n>TABLE>\nNB:\nThe product codes and the \"A\" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1.).\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1779/2002 (OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 6).\nThe other destinations are:\nS00: all destinations (third countries, other territories, victualling and destinations treated as exports from the Community) with the exception of Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo, as defined in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999) and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, save for sugar incorporated in the products referred to in Article 1(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 (OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29)."}
