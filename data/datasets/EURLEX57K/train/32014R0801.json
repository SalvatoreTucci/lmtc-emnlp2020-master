It is appropriate to establish three resettlement periods, in respect of each of which an additional amount may be allocated to a Member State.\n(3) If, in 2017, it appears necessary to provide for a revision in 2019 of the common Union resettlement priorities referred to in Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014, the third resettlement period, covering the years 2018 to 2020, may be limited to the years 2018 and 2019. If so, this Regulation will be amended to provide for an additional resettlement period for the year 2020.\n(4) In order for the Commission to establish the additional amount to be allocated in respect of resettlement in any given resettlement period, each Member State should submit to the Commission an estimate of the number of persons it plans to resettle during that period. The estimate should be submitted via the electronic data exchange system established by Article 2 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 802/2014\u00a0(3).\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 provides that the additional amounts for resettlement are to be allocated to the Member States for the first time in the individual financing decisions approving the national programmes referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014. For the resettlement period covering the years 2014 and 2015, the national programmes to be submitted to the Commission should therefore contain an estimate of the number of persons the Member State plans to resettle during that period. For the other resettlement periods, each Member State should submit an estimate by 15 September of the year preceding the resettlement period concerned.\n(6) The additional amount for resettlement allocated to each Member State is based on an estimate of the number of persons it plans to resettle. To qualify for payment of the additional amount, the persons concerned should have been effectively resettled from the beginning of the period concerned and up to six months following the end of that period.\n(7) In order to be paid the additional amount, which is based on a lump sum for each resettled person, Member States should report to the Commission the number of persons qualifying for payment. They should keep the evidence of these persons qualifying for payment.\n(8) The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 and are as a consequence bound by this Regulation.\n(9) Denmark is not bound by Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 nor by this Regulation.\n(10) In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation and not delay the approval of the national programmes, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,", "main_body": ["Allocation of an additional amount for resettled persons\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to be allocated an additional amount for resettled persons as provided for in Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014, each Member State shall provide the Commission with an estimate of the number of persons that it plans to resettle in any of the following periods:\n(a) the years 2014 and 2015;\n(b) the years 2016 and 2017;\n(c) the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The estimates shall include the number of persons falling within any of the priority categories and groups of persons defined in Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 516/2014.
