Weights of one gramme and multiple gramme weights.\n5.1.1. Grade M1 weights should have the shape of weights of the medium accuracy class.\n5.1.2. Weights of the other accuracy classes may have the external dimensions of weights of the medium accuracy class. 10 kg to 1 gramme weights may also be cylindrical or in the shape of a slightly truncated cone surmounted by a knob.\n5.1.2.1. The height of the body shall be roughly equal to the mean diameter, the permissible difference between the mean diameter and the height being between 3/4 and 5/4 of this diameter.\n5.1.2.2. On all weights the height of the knob should lie between the mean diameter and the mean half-diameter of the body.\n5.1.3. Class E1, E2 and F1 weights do not have to have a knob; they may consist of a single cylindrical body.\n5.1.4. Class E1 and E2 weights must be cast in one piece; other weights may have an adjustment cavity closed by the knob or any other suitable device. The volume of the adjustment cavity shall not exceed 1/5 of the total volume of the weights.\n5.2. Weights of one gramme and sub-multiple weights of the gramme. Weights of one gramme and sub-multiple weights of the gramme shall be polygonal laminated strips or wires suitably shaped to permit easy handling.\ntriangle for 1 \u2014 10 \u2014 100 \u2014 1\u00a0000 mg\nquadrilateral for 2 \u2014 20 \u2014 200 mg\npentagon for 5 \u2014 50 \u2014 500 mg\n1 segment for 1 \u2014 10\u2014100 \u2014 1\u00a0000 mg\n2 segments for 2 \u2014 20 \u2014 200 mg\n5 segments for 5 \u2014 50 \u2014 500 mg\n5.3. Weights of 20 and 50 kg, other than those in class M1 may have a shape suited to their method of handling.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Constituents of the weights\n6.1. Weights shall be made of metal or metal alloy. Such metal or alloy shall be of such quality that under normal conditions of use the deterioriation of the weights shall be negligible in relation to the maximum permissible errors in their accuracy class.\n6.1.1. The density of the weight shall be such that a deviation of 10% of the air density in relation to that specified (1\u03872 kg/m3) will lead to an error of not more than 1/4 of the maximum permissible error.\n6.1.2. The metal or alloy of class E1 E2 and F1 weights shall be virtually non-magnetic.\n6.2. The resistance to corrosion and flaking of the constituent metal or alloy of 5 to 50 kg class M1 weights of parallelepiped shape shall be at least equal to that of grey cast iron.\n6.3. Class M1 weights of cylindrical, shape having nominal values less than or equal to 10 kg shall be made of brass or of a material at least equal in quality to brass.\n6.4. The qualities set out in points 6.2. and 6.3 may be obtained by means of a suitable surface treatment.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surface state\n7.1. The surface of the weights, including their bases and edges, shall be entirely smooth. The surface of class El E2, F1 and F2 weights shall show no porosity when examined by the naked eye, and shall be carefully polished.\n7.2. The surface of class E1 E2, F1 and F2 weights of one gramme and multiples of a gramme may be protected by a metal coating.\n7.3. The surface of class M1 weights of one gramme and multiples of a gramme may be protected by a suitable coating.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjustment material\nWeights of F1 and F2 accuracy classes with an adjustment cavity shall be adjusted either with the same material as that of which they are constituted, or with pure tin, or with molybdenum.\nClassM1 weights may be adjusted with lead.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inscriptions\n9.1. Laminated strip or wire weights having nominal values less than or equal to one gramme shall bear no indication of nominal value.\n9.2. Weights having nominal values equal to or more than one gramme:\n\u2014 in classes E1 and E2 shall bear no indication of their nominal value;\n\u2014 in class F1 shall bear only the indication of nominal value as laid down in point 9.2.1.; this indication shall be burnished or engraved;\n\u2014 in class F2 shall bear the inscriptions of class F1 accompanied by the letter F;\n\u2014 in class M1 shall bear the nominal value marked in figures followed by the symbol of the appropriate unit, either recessed or embossed, on the upper face of the body or knob of the weights.\n9.2.1. The nominal values of the weights shall be indicated in:\n\u2014 kilogrammes for weights of 1 kilogramme or more,\n\u2014 grammes for weights of 1 gramme to 500 grammes.\n9.2.2. Weights appearing two or three times in the sequences shall be distinguished by one or two asterisks or by one or two dots.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EEC final verification mark\nBoxes containing E1, E2, and F1 class weights, and all boxes containing the gramme and sub-multiples of the gramme, shall be sealed with the EEC final verification mark.\nFor class F2 weights the EEC final verification mark shall be affixed to the cover of the adjustment cavity, and where there is no adjustment cavity, upon the base of the weight. For class M1 weights of one gramme to 50 kg the EEC final verification mark shall be placed upon the lead sealing the adjustment cavity opening, or upon the base in the case of weights having no adjustment cavity.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presentation\n11.1. Individual weights and series of weights of classes E1, E2, F1 and F2 shall be contained in boxes.\n11.2. For class M1\n\u2014 individual weights or series of weights up to a value of 500 grammes shall be contained in boxes,\n\u2014 weights having a nominal value greater than 500 grammes may be contained in boxes, fitted in a stand or presente d individually, without protection.\n11.3. The lids of the boxes shall indicate the class of weights which they contain: E1; E2; F1; F2; M1."}
