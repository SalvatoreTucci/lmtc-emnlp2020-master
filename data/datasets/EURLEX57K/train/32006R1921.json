In order to improve and simplify the system for the submission of data, it is appropriate to replace that Regulation with a new instrument. Consequently, Regulation (EEC) No 1382/91 should be repealed.\n(5) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of Community statistical data on landings of fishery products in Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(3) provides a reference framework for statistics in the field of fisheries. In particular, it requires conformity with principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency.\n(7) It is important to ensure the uniform application of this Regulation and, in order to do so, to make provision for a Community procedure to help determine the implementing arrangements within an appropriate timescale and to make the necessary technical adaptations.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4).\n(9) Since the statistical data on landings of fishery products are an essential tool for the management of the Common Fisheries Policy, it is appropriate to lay down the possibility of using the management procedure provided for by Decision 1999/468/EC for granting Member States transitional periods for the implementation of this Regulation and derogations permitting them to exclude statistical data covering a particular sector of the fisheries industry from the national statistical data submitted.\n(10) On the other hand, power should be conferred on the Commission to establish the conditions under which the Annexes should be technically adapted. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1) \u2018Community fishing vessels\u2019 means fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Community;\n2) \u2018EFTA fishing vessels\u2019 means fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, an EFTA country;\n3) \u2018Unit value\u2019 means:\n(a) the value at first sale of the fishery products landed (in national currency) divided by the quantity landed (in tonnes), or\n(b) for fishery products not immediately sold, the average price per tonne in national currency, estimated using an appropriate method.", "Obligations of the Member States\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each year each Member State shall submit to the Commission statistical data in respect of the fishery products landed on its territory by Community and EFTA fishing vessels (hereinafter referred to as \u2018statistical data\u2019).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, the following fishery products shall be deemed to be landed on the territory of the reporting Member State:\n(a) products landed by fishing vessels or other parts of the fishing fleet in national ports within the Community;\n(b) products landed by fishing vessels of the reporting Member State in non-Community ports and covered by the T2M form contained in Annex 43 to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(5).", "Compilation of statistical data\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statistical data shall cover total landings on national territory within the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling techniques may be employed where, owing to the structural characteristics of a particular sector of the fisheries of a Member State, comprehensive data collection would result in difficulties for the national authorities which would be disproportionate to the importance of that sector.", "Statistical data\nThe statistical data shall relate to the total quantities and unit values of the fishery products landed in the reference calendar year.\nThe variables for which statistical data need to be submitted, their definitions and the relevant nomenclatures are given in Annexes II, III and IV.", "Submission of statistical data\nMember States shall submit the statistical data to the Commission on an annual basis in accordance with the format specified in Annex I and using the codes set out in Annexes II, III and\u00a0IV.\nThe statistical data shall be submitted within six months of the end of the reference calendar year.", "Methodology\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 19 January 2008 each Member State shall submit a detailed methodological report to the Commission describing how the data have been collected and the statistics compiled.
