The expression 'regional group' shall be taken to mean the ASEAN or, the CACM or the Andean Group as appropriate.", "Regional cumulation\n1.

Article 6 (1) (b) of the basic Regulation shall not apply to products originating in any of the countries of the regional group when they pass through the territory of any of the other countries of the regional group whether or not further working or processing takes place there.", "Allocation of origin\n1. Products having originating status by virtue of Article 2 of this Regulation shall have the origin of the country of the regional group where the last working or processing was carried out provided that:\n- the value added there, as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article, is greater than the highest customs value of the products used originating in any one of the other countries of the regional group,\n- the working or processing carried out there exceeds that set out in Article 3 (3) of the basic Regulation and in the case of textile products, also those operations referred to in Annex II.\n2. In all other cases products shall have the origin of the country of the regional group which accounts for the highest customs value of the originating products used coming from the other countries of the regional group.\n3. 'Value added' shall be taken to be the ex-works price minus the customs value of each of the products incorporated which originated in another country of the regional group.\nTITLE II\nADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS", "Proof of originating status\n1. Proof of the originating status of products exported from a country of a regional group to another country of the same group to be used in further working or processing, or to be re-exported where no further working or processing takes place, shall be established by a certificate of origin Form A issued or a Form APR made out in the first country.\n2.

This cumulation system is based on the principle that products which have achieved originating status under the basic Regulation, either by being wholly obtained or by having undergone sufficient working or processing, will then be treated anywhere in the regional group in the same way as products which have achieved originating status locally. The converse is that products which have not achieved originating status in a country of the regional group, although processed there, are treated as third country products in all further working or processing carried out in another country of the group.\n2. This cumulation system also permits originating products from one country in the regional group to pass through another country in the group and to be re-exported in the same state with a certificate of origin Form A being issued or a Form APR being made out in the country of final export; irrespective as to whether the conditions laid down in Article 6 (1) (b) of the basic Regulation have been met there.\nANNEX  II\nWORKING MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 3\nWorking such as:\n- fitting of buttons and/or other types of fastenings,\n- making of button-holes,\n- finishing off the ends of trouser legs and sleeves or the bottom hemming of skirts and dresses etc.,\n- hemming of handerkerchiefs, table linen, etc.,\n- fitting of trimmings and accessories such as pockets, labels, badges, etc.,\n- ironing and other preparations of garments for sale 'ready made',\n- or any combination of such working."}
