A limited period should therefore be allowed for personnel to obtain a certificate.\n(4) For the purpose of avoiding undue administrative burden, it should be allowed to build a certification system on existing qualification schemes provided that the skills and knowledge covered and the relevant qualification system are equivalent to the minimum standards envisaged by this Regulation.\n(5) Entities manufacturing or operating equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gas based solvents could be designated as evaluation or certification bodies, or both, provided that they fulfil the relevant requirements.\n(6) In order to avoid unnecessary administrative costs, a Member State, in which currently no fluorinated greenhouse gas-based solvents are used, should be entitled not to establish the full certification system, provided the Member State makes the necessary arrangement to ensure that certificates could be issued without undue delays in case they might be requested in future, therefore not creating undue market entry barriers.\n(7) Examination is an effective means of testing the ability of a candidate to carry out properly the actions which can directly cause leakage, as well as those that can indirectly cause leakage.\n(8) Officially designated evaluation and certification bodies should ensure compliance with the minimum requirements set out in this Regulation and thereby contribute to the effective and efficient mutual recognition of certificates throughout the Community.\n(9) Information on the certification system issuing certificates subject to mutual recognition should be notified to the Commission in the format established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 308/2008 of 2 April 2008 establishing, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the format for notification of the training and certification programmes of the Member States\u00a0(2).\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["Subject matter
