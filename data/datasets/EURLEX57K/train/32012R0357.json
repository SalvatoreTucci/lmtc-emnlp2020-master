Article 12(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 provides for a transitional period to allow products which have been legally manufactured and labelled in the Union or legally imported into the Union and put into free circulation before 1 July 2012 to be marketed until all stocks are used up. Firstly, this transitional period is considered too short and, secondly, the use of the term \u2018legally\u2019 in that provision leads to confusion regarding the transition between Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 and Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012.\n(2) In order to allow labels using the term \u2018Community\u2019 to be used for a longer period, it should therefore be provided that products which have been manufactured and labelled in the Union or imported into the Union and put into free circulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 before 1 January 2013 may be marketed until all stocks are used up.\n(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Article 12(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 shall be replaced by the following:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Products which have been manufactured and labelled in the Union or imported into the Union and put into free circulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 before 1 January 2013 may be marketed until all stocks are used up.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 April 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 12, 14.1.2012, p. 14.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 155, 14.6.2002, p. 27."}
