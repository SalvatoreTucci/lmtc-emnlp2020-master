Accordingly, in view of the increasing shortage of Community seafarers, the balance between supply and demand in personnel can be maintained more efficiently at the Community, rather than the national level. It is therefore essential that the common transport policy in the field of maritime transport be extended to facilitate the movement of seafarers within the Community.\n(3) As regards seafarers' qualifications, the Community has laid down minimum maritime education, training and certification requirements by way of Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4\u00a0April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers\u00a0(3). That Directive incorporates into Community law the international training, certification and watchkeeping standards laid down by the STCW Convention.\n(4) Directive 2001/25/EC provides that seafarers must hold a certificate of competency issued and endorsed by the competent authority of a Member State in accordance with that Directive and entitling the lawful holder thereof to serve on a ship in the capacity and perform the functions involved at the level of responsibility specified therein.\n(5) Under Directive 2001/25/EC, mutual recognition among Member States of certificates held by seafarers, whether or not nationals of a Member State, is subject to Directives 89/48/EEC\u00a0(4) and 92/51/EEC\u00a0(5) setting up, respectively, a first and a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training. Those Directives do not provide for the automatic recognition of formal qualifications of seafarers, as seafarers may be subject to compensation measures.\n(6) Each Member State should recognise any certificate and other evidence of formal qualifications issued by another Member State in accordance with Directive 2001/25/EC. Therefore, each Member State should permit a seafarer having acquired his/her certificate of competency in another Member State, satisfying the requirements of that Directive, to take up or to pursue the maritime profession for which he/she is qualified, without any prerequisites other than those imposed on its own nationals.\n(7) Since this Directive is aimed at facilitating the mutual recognition of certificates, it does not regulate the conditions concerning access to employment.\n(8) The STCW Convention specifies language requirements for seafarers. These requirements should be introduced into Community law to ensure effective communication on board ships and facilitate the free movement of seafarers within the Community.\n(9) Today, the proliferation of certificates of competency of seafarers obtained by fraud poses a serious danger to safety at sea and the protection of the marine environment. In most cases, holders of fraudulent certificates of competency do not meet the minimum certification requirements of the STCW Convention. These seafarers could easily be involved in maritime accidents.\n(10) Member States should therefore take and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices associated with certificates of competency as well as pursue their efforts within the IMO to achieve strict and enforceable agreements on the worldwide combating of such practices. The Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) is an appropriate forum for exchanging information, experience and best practices in this respect.\n(11) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01406/2002\u00a0(6), established a European Maritime Safety Agency (the Agency), for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships. One of the tasks assigned to the Agency is to assist the Commission in the performance of any task assigned to it by Community legislation applicable to the training, certification and watchkeeping of ships' crews.\n(12) The Agency should therefore assist the Commission in verifying that Member States comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive and Directive 2001/25/EC.\n(13) The mutual recognition among Member States of certificates held by seafarers, whether or not nationals of a Member State, should no longer be subject to Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC, but should be governed by this Directive.\n(14) Directive 2001/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(15) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the mutual recognition of the seafarers' certificates issued by the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(16) In accordance with paragraph\u00a034 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making\u00a0(7), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and their transposition measures, and to make those tables public,", "main_body": ["Scope\nThis Directive shall apply to seafarers who are:\n(a) nationals of a Member State;\n(b) non-nationals who hold a certificate issued by a Member State.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018seafarer\u2019 means a person who is trained and who is certificated by a Member State at least in accordance with the requirements laid down in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 2001/25/EC;\n(b) \u2018certificate\u2019 means a valid document within the meaning of Article\u00a04 of Directive 2001/25/EC;\n(c) \u2018appropriate certificate\u2019 means a certificate as defined in Article\u00a01(27) of Directive 2001/25/EC;\n(d) \u2018endorsement\u2019 means a valid document issued by the competent authority of a Member State in accordance with Article\u00a05(2) and (6) of Directive 2001/25/EC;\n(e) \u2018recognition\u2019 means the acceptance by the competent authorities of a host Member State of a certificate or appropriate certificate issued by another Member State;\n(f) \u2018host Member State\u2019 means any Member State in which a seafarer seeks recognition of his/her appropriate certificate(s) or other certificate(s);\n(g) \u2018STCW Convention\u2019 means the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, in its up-to-date version;\n(h) \u2018STCW Code\u2019 means the Seafarers' Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code, as adopted by Resolution 2 of the 1995 STCW Conference of Parties, in its up-to-date version;\n(i) \u2018the Agency\u2019 means the European Maritime Safety Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01406/2002.", "Recognition of certificates\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every Member State shall recognise appropriate certificates or other certificates issued by another Member State in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 2001/25/EC.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The recognition of appropriate certificates shall be limited to the capacities, functions and levels of competency prescribed therein and be accompanied by an endorsement attesting such recognition.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure the right to appeal against any refusal to endorse a valid certificate, or the absence of any response, in accordance with national legislation and procedures.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding paragraph\u00a02, the competent authorities of a host Member State may impose further limitations on capacities, functions and levels of competence relating to near-coastal voyages, as referred to in Article\u00a07 of Directive 2001/25/EC, or alternative certificates issued under Regulation VII/1 of Annex\u00a0I to Directive 2001/25/EC.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A host Member State shall ensure that seafarers who present for recognition certificates for functions at the management level have an appropriate knowledge of the maritime legislation of that Member State relevant to the functions they are permitted to perform.", "Amendments to Directive 2001/25/EC\nDirective 2001/25/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
