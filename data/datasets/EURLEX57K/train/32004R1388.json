For reasons of clarity, it is appropriate to define the moment at which the farm returns can be considered to have been forwarded to the Commission taking into account the development in those technical specifications.\n(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1915/83 provides furthermore that the liaison agency shall forward all the farm returns to the Commission not later than nine months after the end of the accounting year to which they relate. It is appropriate to prolong this period for the accounting year 2003, to give the liaison agencies time to adjust their work organisation in order to respect the new definition of the moment at which the farm returns can be considered to have been forwarded to the Commission.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1915/83 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network,", "main_body": ["Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1915/83 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 3\nThe liaison agency shall forward all the farm returns, presented in the form laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2237/77, to the Commission not later than nine months after the end of the accounting year to which they relate.
