Current knowledge suggests that the risk for public health in relation to this subtype is inferior to the risk of the strain circulating in Asia, which is an H5N1 virus subtype.\n(5) However, in view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds and hatching eggs of these species and of fresh meat of poultry, ratites, wild and farmed feathered game, meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of those species, obtained from birds slaughtered after 27 January 2004, and imports of eggs for human consumption, have been suspended from the United States of America as of 25 February 2004 by Commission Decisions 2004/187/EC(3), 2004/256/EC(4), and by Decision 2004/274/EC(5) of 23 March 2004.\n(6) Commission Decision 94/984/EC of 20 December 1994 laying down animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of fresh poultrymeat from certain third countries(6), Commission Decision 96/482/EC of 12 July 1996 laying down animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of poultry and hatching eggs other than ratites and eggs thereof from third countries including animal health measures to be applied after such importation(7), Commission Decision 2000/585/EC drawing up a list from which Member States authorise imports of rabbit meat and certain wild and farmed game meat, and laying down the animal and public health and the veterinary certification conditions for such imports(8), Commission Decision 2000/609/EC of 29 September 2000 laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of farmed ratite meat(9) and Commission Decision 2001/751/EC of 16 October 2001 laying down animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of live ratites and hatching eggs thereof from third countries including animal health measures to be applied after such importation, amending Commission Decision 95/233/EC drawing up a list of third countries from which the Member States authorise imports of live poultry and hatching eggs and amending Commission Decision 96/659/EC on protective measures in relation to Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever(10) respectively require that the veterinary authorities of the United States of America, before dispatching live poultry and hatching eggs, live ratites and hatching eggs, fresh meat of poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game certify that the United States of America are free from avian influenza. The veterinary authorities of the United States of America had therefore to suspend all certification following that outbreak.\n(7) The certificates for meat products and meat preparations consisting of or containing poultry meat are laid down in Commission Decision 97/221/EC of 28 February 1997 laying down the animal health conditions and model veterinary certificates in respect of imports of meat products from third countries and revoking Decision 91/449/EEC(11) and Commission Decision 2000/572/EC of 8 September 2000 laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of minced meat and meat preparations from third countries and repealing Decision 97/29/EC(12) and make reference to the animal health requirements set out in Decision 94/984/EC for fresh poultrymeat.\n(8) Commission Decision 97/222/EC(13), lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products, and establishes treatment regimes in order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products. The treatment that must be applied to the product depends on the health status of the country of origin, in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; in order to avoid an unnecessary burden on trade, imports of poultrymeat products originating in the United States of America treated to a temperature of at least 70 \u00b0Celsius throughout the product should continue to be authorised.\n(9) Sanitary control measures applicable to raw material for the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs and pharmaceutical or technical products allow the exclusion from the scope of this Decision of channelled imports of such products.\n(10) The United States of America have signed an Agreement with the European Community on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal products(14).\n(11) The United States of America have communicated additional information on the epidemiological situation and the control measures taken to confine the disease, with a view to obtain the implementation by the Community of regionalisation measures in accordance with the provisions in the Veterinary Agreement; in the light of this information, Community measures can be reduced to Texas, only.\n(12) Decision 2004/274/EC should be repealed.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.
