Taking note of the conclusions adopted on 4 June 2012 by the ILC Committee on the Application of Standards and considering that maintaining the existing measures would no longer help attaining the desired result, the ILC decided to lift restrictions, which excluded the Government of Myanmar/Burma from receiving ILO technical cooperation and assistance. It also suspended for one year the ILO request of its members to review their relationships with Myanmar/Burma to ensure forced labour is not being used in those relationships.\n(6) On 17 September 2012, the Commission published a report pursuant to Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 552/97 with respect to the forced labour in Myanmar/Burma, containing its findings (\u2018the Report\u2019). The Report concludes that the progress made by Myanmar/Burma towards complying with the ILO recommendations, which has been acknowledged by the competent ILO monitoring bodies, means that violations of the principles laid down in ILO Convention No 29 are no longer considered as \u2018serious and systematic\u2019 and recommends that access to generalised tariff preferences should be reinstated to Myanmar/Burma.\n(7) In view of the ILC resolution and of the Report, and pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 552/97, the temporary withdrawal of Myanmar/Burma\u2019s access to the tariff preferences granted by Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 should therefore be repealed, as of the date of the adoption of the ILC resolution.\n(8) The Commission should continue to monitor developments in Myanmar/Burma with respect to forced labour and react to them in accordance with the procedures in force, including, if necessary, with renewed withdrawal procedures,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 552/97 is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 13 June 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 12 June 2013.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.
