Therefore, Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001 should be adapted for the remaining implementing powers.\n(5) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to approve rapid tests, to extend certain provisions to other products of animal origin, to adopt implementing rules including the method to confirm Bovine Spongiform Encepalopathy (BSE) in ovine and caprine animals, to modify the Annexes and to adopt transitional measures. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(6) It is also appropriate to limit, following confirmation of the presence of a transmissible spongiform encepalopathy (TSE), the possibility for Member States to apply other measures to cases where the approval of those measures by the Commission is based on a favourable risk assessment taking particularly into account the control measures in that Member State, and where those measures offer an equivalent level of protection.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a0999/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article\u00a05(3), the third subparagraph shall be replaced by the following:\n2.
