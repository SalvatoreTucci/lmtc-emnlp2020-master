In that report the Food Safety Authority of Ireland stated that it has not identified any safety concerns with the consumption of food supplements containing coriander seed oil at the proposed use levels of 600\u00a0mg/day and therefore considers that this novel ingredient meets the criteria for novel food set out in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(3) On 8 November 2011, the Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to the other Member States.\n(4) Reasoned objections were raised within the 60 day period laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(5) On 14 February 2013, the Commission consulted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asking it to carry out an additional assessment for coriander seed oil as food ingredient in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(6) On 10 October 2013, EFSA adopted a Scientific Opinion on the safety of coriander seed oil as a novel food ingredient\u00a0(2), concluding that it is safe under the proposed uses and use levels.\n(7) The opinion gives sufficient grounds to establish that coriander seed oil in the proposed uses and use levels complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.\n(8) Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3) lays down requirements on food supplements.
