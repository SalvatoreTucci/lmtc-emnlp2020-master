In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulations should be codified.\n(2) Article 158(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that hops and hop products from third countries may be imported only if their quality standards are at least equivalent to those adopted for like products harvested within the Community or their derivatives. Article 158(2) provides, however, that these products should be considered as being of those standards if they are accompanied by an attestation issued by the authorities of the country of origin and recognised as equivalent to the certificate required for the marketing of hops and hop products of Community origin.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006 of 14 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the certification of hops and hop products\u00a0(5) lays down very strict marketing requirements for hop products, and mixtures in particular. There is at the moment no effective method of checking at frontiers that these requirements are met. The only possible substitute for such a check is an undertaking on the part of the exporting countries to comply with the Community's marketing requirements for these products. It is therefore necessary to require that such products be accompanied by an attestation as specified in Article 158(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n(4) In order to ensure that Community rules on the certification of hops are respected, Member States should carry out checks to verify whether imported hops conform to the minimum marketing requirements laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006.\n(5) Certain third countries have undertaken to comply with the requirements prescribed for the marketing of hops and hop products and have authorised certain agencies to issue attestations of equivalence. These attestations should therefore be recognised as equivalent to Community certificates and the products covered by them admitted to free circulation.\n(6) It is the responsibility of the organisations concerned in those third countries to keep up to date the information contained in Annex I and to maintain close cooperation with the Commission by communicating to it the information concerned.\n(7) In order to facilitate control by the competent authorities of the Member States, it is essential to prescribe the form and, where necessary, the content of the attestation and the rules for its utilisation.\n(8) In order to take account of trade practices, the competent authorities must be empowered, if a consignment is resold or split up, to have prepared under their supervision an extract from the attestation in respect of each new consignment resulting from the splitting up.\n(9) By analogy with the Community's certification system, certain products should be exempt by virtue of their utilisation from the presentation of the attestations provided for in this Regulation.\n(10) The measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entry into free circulation in the Community of the products from third countries referred to in point (f) of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be conditional upon proof being furnished that the requirements specified in Article 158(1) of that Regulation have been met.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proof referred to in Article 1(1) of this Regulation shall be furnished by production of the attestation provided for in Article 158(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, hereinafter referred to as an \u2018attestation of equivalence\u2019.", "For the purposes of this Regulation, \u2018consignment\u2019 means a quantity of a product having the same characteristics and sent by the same consignor at the same time to the same consignee.", "Attestations accompanying hops and hop products imported from third countries issued by an agency authorised by the third country of origin and appearing in Annex I shall be recognised as attestations of equivalence.\nAnnex I shall be revised on the basis of information communicated by the third countries concerned.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The attestation of equivalence shall be made out for each consignment and shall consist of an original and two copies to be drawn up on a form corresponding to the model set out in Annex II and in accordance with the rules set out in Annex IV.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An attestation of equivalence shall be valid only if it is duly completed and authenticated by one of the agencies referred to in Annex I.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A duly authenticated attestation of equivalence is one which shows the place and date of issue and which has been signed and bears the stamp of the issuing agency.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each unit of packaging covered by an attestation of equivalence shall bear the following particulars in one of the official languages of the Community:\n(a) the description of the product;\n(b) the variety or varieties;\n(c) the country of origin;\n(d) the marks and numbers indicated in section 9 of the attestation of equivalence or the extract.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The particulars provided for in paragraph 1 shall appear in legible, indelible characters of uniform size on the outside of the package.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, before its entry into free circulation, a consignment covered by an attestation of equivalence is split up and redispatched an attestation extract shall be drawn up in respect of each new consignment resulting from such splitting.\nThe attestation shall be replaced by the necessary number of attestation extracts.\nEach extract shall be drawn up by the party concerned in one original and two copies on a form corresponding to the model given in Annex III and in accordance with the rules set out in Annex IV.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customs authorities shall endorse accordingly the original and the two copies of the attestation of equivalence, and shall countersign the original and the two copies of each extract.\nThey shall retain the original of the attestation of equivalence, send the two copies to the competent authority as referred to in Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006 and return the original and the two copies of each extract to the person concerned.", "On completion of customs formalities required for release for free circulation in the Community of the product to which the attestation of equivalence or the extract relates, the original and the two copies shall be submitted to the customs authorities who shall countersign them, retaining the original.
