With effect from 1 January 2002 the concept of gross national product was replaced by the concept of gross national income (GNI), pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 2(7) of Council Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities\u2019 own resources\u00a0(3).\n(2) The second subparagraph of Article 2(7) of Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom provides that where modifications to the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 95) result in significant changes in the GNI as provided by the Commission, the Council shall decide whether those modifications shall apply for the purposes of that Decision.\n(3) It is appropriate to use the most recent statistical concepts for the purposes of the Union\u2019s budget and its own resources, in particular as far as the establishment of the GNI as provided by the Commission in application of ESA 95 is concerned. FISIM should therefore be allocated for the establishment of the GNI for the purposes of the Union\u2019s budget and its own resources.\n(4) By October 2008, all EU-27 Member States had transmitted their data including on FISIM allocation according to the new methodology. The assessment of those data indicated that the allocation of FISIM results in a significant change in the sense of the second subparagraph of Article 2(7) of Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom since it increases GNI by more than 1\u00a0% on average and implies, when applying the method described in Article 3 of that Decision, a change in the ceilings set by Article 3.\n(5) Therefore the allocation of FISIM should apply for the purposes of Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom.\n(6) It is deemed appropriate that the ensuing changes apply as from the financial year 2010,", "main_body": ["Financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) shall be allocated for the establishment of the gross national income for the purposes of the Union\u2019s budget and its own resources.", "The allocation of FISIM pursuant to Article 1 shall apply for the purposes of Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom from 1 January 2010.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2010.", "This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 March 2010.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nE.
