These measures, as specifically amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 221/2002\u00a0(3), include maximum levels for the heavy metals lead, cadmium and mercury.\n(2) It is essential, in order to protect public health, to keep contaminants at levels which do not cause health concerns. Maximum levels for lead, cadmium and mercury must be safe and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) based upon good manufacturing and agricultural/ fishery practices. On the basis of new information on the achievability of maximum levels in\u00a0certain aquatic species it is necessary to revise the\u00a0relevant provisions of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0466/2001 for these contaminants in certain foods. The revised provisions maintain a high level of consumer health protection.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 January 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.
