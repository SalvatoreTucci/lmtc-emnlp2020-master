Under reservation of Community legislation to be defined the procedure and number of samples to to taken depending upon the appropriate national legislation for each Member State.\nThe samples shall be dispatched to the laboratory as soon as possible after sampling.\n1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Report\nSamples shall be accompanied with a report which will be established following the Member States' legislation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling equipment\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifications\nAll sampling equipment shall be made of suitable material of adequate strength, which does not bring about a change in the sample which may affect any result of the subsequent examination and should not cause any change in the samples while sampling is carried out. The use of stainless steel is recommended.\nAll surfaces shall be smooth and free from crevices and all corners shall be rounded. Sampling equipment shall comply with the requirements laid down with respect to each product to be sampled.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling containers\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifications\nSample containers and closures shall be of materials and construction which adequately protect the sample and which do not bring about in the sample a change which may affect any result of the subsequent analysis or examination. Materials which are appropriate include glass, some metals and some plastics. The containers shall preferably be opaque. If transparent or translucent the containers with contents shall be stored in a dark place.\nContainers and closures shall be clean and dry. The shape and capacity of the container shall be appropriate to the requirements laid down for the product to be sampled.\nSingle service plastic containers, containers made from plastic, laminates including an aluminium foil or suitable plastic bags, with appropriate methods of closure, may be used.\nContainers other than plastic bags shall be securely closed either by means of a suitable stopper or by a screw-cap of metal or plastic material having, if necessary, an air-tight plastic liner. Any stopper or liner used should be insoluble, non-absorbant and greaseproof, and will not influence the odour, flavour, properties or composition of the sample.\nStoppers shall be made of, or covered with, non-absorbant odourless materials.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling technique\nThe sample container shall be closed immediately after sampling.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Storage of samples\nThe recommended storage temperatures of the samples of the various caseins and caseinates shall not exceed 25 oC.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transport of samples\nSamples shall be brought to the laboratory responsible for the tests as soon as possible (preferably within 24 hours of sample taking).\nDuring transit, precautions shall be taken to prevent exposure to contaminating odours, to direct sunlight and to temperatures greater than 25 oC.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0METHOD \u2014 SAMPLING OF EDIBLE CASEINS AND CASEINATES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and field of application\nThis method describes the sampling for chemical analysis of:\n\u2014 edible acid caseins,\n\u2014 edible rennet caseins,\n\u2014 edible caseinates.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equipment\nSee Section 2 of General Provisions.\n2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Borers\nOf sufficient length to reach the bottom of the product container. Borers conforming to the description given in Part III of this Directive are appropriate.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spoon, spatula or scoop\nBroad-loaded.\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample containers\nSee Section 3 of General Provisions.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nCare shall be taken to minimize the uptake of atmospheric moisture by the content of the product container during or in the period prior to sampling for analysis. The product container shall be securely reclosed after sampling.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\n3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling\nA sample of not less than 200 grams shall be taken. The clean and dry borer shall be passed through the product, if necessary with the container inclined or laid on its side. The slit shall be oriented downward and an even rate of penetration used. When the borer reaches the bottom of the container it shall be rotated through 180o, withdrawn and the contents discharged into the sample container. One or more bores shall be taken to make a sample of not less than 200 grams. The sample container shall be closed immediately after sampling is complete. Such sampling shall be carried out on the same batch.\n3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling products packed in small retail packages\nThe intact and unopened package may constitute the sample. As far as possible one or more packages of the same batch should be taken to form a sample of not less than 200 grams.\nIf this is not possible, use another method to constitute a representative sample.\n3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preservation, storage and transport of sample\nSections 5 and 6 of the General Provisions.\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BORERS FOR THE SAMPLING OF EDIBLE CASEINS AND CASEINATES IN BULK\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Types of borer\nType A: Long (see fig. 1);\nType B: Short (see fig. 1).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Materials\nBlade and stem shall be made of polished metal, preferably stainless steel. The grip of the long type should preferably be made of stainless steel. The short type borer shall have a detachable grip of wood or plastic, fitted with a bayonet-catch in the blade.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Construction\n3.1. Shape, material and finish shall be such as to permit the borer to be easily cleaned.\n3.2. The protruding edge of the blade of type A shall be sufficiently sharp to serve as a scraper.\n3.3. The point of the blade shall be sufficiently sharp as to facilitate sampling.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principal dimensions\nThe borers shall conform to the dimensions (subject to a tolerance of 10 %) given in the table below:\n(in mm)\nType A Long Type B Short\nLength of blade 800 400\nThickness of metal of blade 1 to 2 1 to 2\nInner diameter of blade at point 18 32\nInner diameter of blade at grip or stem 22 28\nSlit width at point 4 20\nSlit width at grip or stem 14 14\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note on use of borers\n5.1. With less free-flowing powders, the borers can be inserted vertically. Type A borers are filled completely by turning and then can be withdrawn vertically.\n5.2. In the case of free-flowing powder, the containers shall be inclined, the borers inserted nearly horizontally with the slit downwards and withdrawn with the slit upwards.\nFigure\nBORERS SUITABLE FOR THE SAMPLING OF CASEINS AND CASEINATES"}
