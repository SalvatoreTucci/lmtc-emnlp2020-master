In order to resolve the latest practical difficulties, that time limit should be postponed once again. Applying the various provisions regarding the grant of the derogation imposes a serious and complex administrative burden, particularly as regards checks and penalties. In the interests of sound administration, the date in question should therefore be postponed definitively to 31 July 2005.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,", "main_body": ["Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 is hereby replaced by the following:\n\u20181a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The deadline laid down in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall be postponed to 31 July 2005.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 August 2004.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 July 2004.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1.
