As from 18\u00a0October 2004, amino acids, their salts and analogues fall under the scope of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003. The application is therefore to be considered as an application under Article\u00a07 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003.\n(4) In order to comply with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a07 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, additional information was submitted in support of the application.\n(5) The application concerns authorisation of L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate as a feed additive for salmonids, to be classified in the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and the functional group \u2018amino acids, their salts and analogues\u2019.\n(6) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinions of 2\u00a0March 2005\u00a0(3) and of 18\u00a0October 2006\u00a0(4) that L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It further concluded that L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article\u00a05(2) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, it is an essential amino acid also for fish, and the use of that preparation has been shown to prevent cataracts under farming conditions for salmonids. The opinion of the Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. The report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed was submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003 to the Authority. The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018nutritional additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018amino acids, their salts and analogues\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7\u00a0March 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.
