These controls are to be included in the general control plan drawn up on the basis of risk analysis.\n(2) Bulgaria and Romania are applying the levy system for the first time in the 12-month period 2007/2008. In order to facilitate the application of the new system, these Member States should be allowed to reduce the intensity of control for deliveries during a transitional period of one year.\n(3) Experience shows that in Member States the number of producers with one or two cows is still significant, especially in direct sales. To keep the same control intensity for these producers imposes a disproportionate administrative burden and could divert the focus of control measures from higher risk activities. Therefore it would be appropriate to reduce the control intensity for small direct sellers producing quantities of less than 5\u00a0000\u00a0kg milk equivalent.\n(4) In order to allow the Member States to benefit from a less burdensome situation resulting from the adjusted intensity of controls, and taking into account that according to Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 controls are carried out partly during the 12-month period in question, partly after the 12-month period, it is appropriate to apply the adjusted intensity of controls for the 12-month period 2007/2008, i.e. the period starting on 1 April 2007 and finishing on 30 March 2008.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the management committee for milk and milk products,", "main_body": ["Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 595/2004 is amended as follows:\n1. In paragraph 1, point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) 2\u00a0% of producers for the 12-month period 2007/2008 and for the following 12-month periods, except in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, where at least 1\u00a0% of producers shall be controlled for the 12-month period 2007/2008;\u2019\n2.
