whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;\nWhereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;\nWhereas carazolol, diazinon and spiramycin (applicable to the species cattle and chicken) should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas lecirelin, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, dinoprost tromethamine, hydrochloric acid, malic acid, 1-tartaric acid and its mono- and di-basic salt of sodium, potassium and calcium, benzylalcohol, ethanol, n-butanol should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, danofloxacin and erythromycin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for tylosin and spiramycin (applicable to the species pigs);\nWhereas it appears that maximum residue limits cannot be established for furazolidone because residues, at whatever limit, in foodstuffs of animal origin constitute a hazard to the health of the consumer; whereas furazolidone should therefore be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;\nWhereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC\u00a0(3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC\u00a0(4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Veterinary Medicinal Products Sector,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II, III and IV of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the sixtieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 June 1995.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 224, 18. 8. 1990, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0See page 22 of this Official Journal.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 317, 6. 11. 1981, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ No L 214, 24. 8. 1993, P. 31.\nANNEX\nRegulation (EEC) No 2377/90 is amended as follows:\nA.
