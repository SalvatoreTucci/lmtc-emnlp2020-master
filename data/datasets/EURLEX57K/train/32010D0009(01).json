It is legally structured as a multiplicity of real-time gross settlement systems, each of which is a TARGET2 component operated by a Eurosystem central bank (CB). Guideline ECB/2007/2 harmonises the rules for the TARGET2 components to the greatest extent possible.\n(3) The Eurosystem oversees TARGET2, with the ECB taking the lead.\n(4) Article 38(1) of Annex II to Guideline ECB/2007/2 \u2014 the Harmonised Conditions for participation in TARGET2 (hereinafter the Harmonised Conditions) obliges each CB to keep confidential all sensitive or secret payment information belonging to participants holding TARGET2 accounts with that CB, unless the participant has given its written consent to disclosure or such disclosure is permitted or required under national law.\n(5) Article 38(2) of the Harmonised Conditions nevertheless provides that participants agree that, provided such disclosure does not conflict with the applicable law, each CB may disclose payment information regarding the participant obtained in the course of the operation of the relevant TARGET2 component to: (i) other CBs or third parties that are involved in the operation of TARGET2, to the extent that this is necessary for the efficient functioning of TARGET2; or (ii) supervisory and oversight authorities of Member States and the Union, to the extent that this is necessary for the performance of their public tasks.\n(6) Only when the use of aggregate TARGET2 payment data is not sufficient for the CBs to ensure the effective functioning of TARGET2, is it necessary for all CBs to have access to transaction-level data extracted from the SSP of the participants in all TARGET2 components, including indirect participants and addressable BIC holders. Access by all CBs to such transaction-level data also becomes necessary for the performance of the public tasks of the Eurosystem as overseer of TARGET2 when the use of aggregate TARGET2 payment data does not suffice.\n(7) Such CB access to transaction-level data of all TARGET2 participants should be limited to what is necessary to enable the CBs, as operators and as overseers of TARGET2, to conduct quantitative analyses of transaction flows between TARGET2 participants or to make numerical simulations of the settlement process of TARGET2. Such CB access should exclude all information on the participants\u2019 customers except where such customers are indirect participants or addressable BIC holders.\n(8) When conducted by CBs in their capacity as operators of TARGET2, these quantitative analyses and numerical simulations should serve in particular the purposes of ensuring the efficiency of the design of TARGET2, monitoring the effects of its pricing mechanisms, and making cost-benefit analyses of additional features and services. When conducted by CBs in their capacity as overseers of TARGET2, they should serve in particular the purposes of analysing operational failures in TARGET2, analysing changes in payment patterns and timing, quantifying liquidity levels and settlement outcomes with decreased liquidity, making statistical and structural analyses of transaction flows, and supporting regular and ad-hoc oversight assessments against applicable standards.\n(9) It is of the utmost importance to preserve the confidentiality of transaction-level data. For this purpose, access to and use of transaction-level data should be limited to a small group of designated staff members from the CBs. In addition to the rules on professional conduct and confidentiality applicable to CB staff members, the Payments and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC) of the European System of Central Banks should establish specific rules for access to and use of transaction-level data. CBs should ensure compliance with these rules by their designated staff members and the PSSC should monitor such compliance.\n(10) The PSSC should have the option to publish information derived from the use of transaction-level data, provided that this information does not make it possible to identify participants or participants\u2019 customers, whether directly or indirectly.\n(11) In order to allow quantitative analyses and numerical simulations to be made using transaction-level data, the Eurosystem should establish a specific device, the TARGET2 Simulator.\n(12) In addition to Article 38(2) of the Harmonised Conditions which covers transaction-level data, Article 38(3) of the Harmonised Conditions states more broadly that, provided it does not make it possible, whether directly or indirectly, to identify the participant or the participant\u2019s customers, a CB may use, disclose or publish payment information regarding the participant or the participant\u2019s customers for statistical, historical, scientific or other purposes in the exercise of the public functions of the CB or of functions of other public entities to whom the information is disclosed. Without prejudice to the ability of the CBs to use, disclose or publish such information under this Article, the PSSC should coordinate the actions of the CBs.\n(13) Article 5 of Guideline ECB/2007/2 specifies the governance levels of TARGET2, including that the Governing Council is responsible for the direction, management and control of TARGET2 and that the PSSC assists the Governing Council as an advisory body in all matters related to TARGET2. Article 5 of Guideline ECB/2007/2 establishes further that the PSSC conducts the execution of the tasks assigned to the CBs in Guideline ECB/2007/2 within the general framework defined by the Governing Council. In this latter capacity, the PSSC is to conduct certain tasks under this Decision. A voting rule for the PSSC and the possibility for the Governing Council to review the PSSC\u2019s decisions are necessary.\n(14) The provisions of this Decision will be extended to apply to non-Eurosystem TARGET2-connected central banks by means of an agreement between these central banks and the Eurosystem,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CBs shall access transaction-level data on all participants of all TARGET2 components extracted from TARGET2 for the purposes of ensuring the efficient functioning of TARGET2 and its oversight.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For each CB, access to the data referred to in paragraph 1 and their use for quantitative analyses and numerical simulations shall be limited to one staff member and up to three alternates for both operation and oversight of TARGET2, respectively.
