The machinery bore the CE marking and was accompanied by an EC Declaration of conformity.\n(2) The measure was motivated by the non-conformity of the machinery with the following essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC:\n\u2014 1.3.7 \u2014 Risks related to moving parts\n\u2014 1.3.8 \u2014 Choice of protection against risks arising from moving parts\n\u2014 1.4.2.2 \u2014 Interlocking moveable guards\n\u2014 2.1.1 (d) and (e) \u2014 Foodstuffs machinery \u2014 cleaning.\n(3) The measure followed an accident that occurred during cleaning of the machinery when the operator reached into the drainpipe of the conveyor to free blocked vegetables while the screw was running, sustaining injuries to his fingers. The flap preventing access to the drain pipe was a fixed guard. Since it had to be opened several times per day for cleaning, the Finnish authorities considered that an interlocking moveable guard should be fitted. Furthermore, the Finnish authorities noted that the machine could not be effectively cleaned while at a standstill as specified in the instructions.\n(4) In accordance with Article 11(3) of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Commission asked the manufacturer Cabinplant A/S to present his observations on the measure. The manufacturer replied that the type TSF 350 screw conveyor had been designed and manufactured by a supplier and purchased by Cabinplant A/S for fitting into an integrated system. He stated if future screw conveyors of this type were purchased he would ensure that they complied with the requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC.\n(5) Examination of the evidence provided by the Finnish authorities and of the observations communicated by the manufacturer confirms that the screw conveyor of the type TSF 350 not fitted with an interlocking moveable guard to prevent access to the drainpipe while the screw is running fails to comply with the essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC and that this non-conformity gives rise to a serious risk of injury to operators,", "main_body": ["The measure taken by the Finnish authorities prohibiting the placing on the market of screw conveyors of the type TSF 350 not fitted with an interlocking moveable guard to prevent access to the drainpipe while the screw is running is justified.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 October 2013.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 24."}
