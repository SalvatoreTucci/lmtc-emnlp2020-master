Procedures should also be laid down to ensure the traceability of the products used for animal feed.\n(8) So that the quantities awarded can be managed accurately, an allocation coefficient should be fixed for tenders offering the minimum selling price, while allowing tenderers to specify a minimum quantity awarded below which they do not wish their tender to stand.\n(9) When the French intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.\n(10) While respecting the tenderers' anonymity, they should be identified by numbers so that it is evident which have submitted several tenders and what prices they have offered.\n(11) For control purposes, tenders must be traceable by their reference numbers, while safeguarding anonymity.\n(12) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["The French intervention agency shall launch a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the internal market of the Community of quantities of rice from the 1999 harvest held by it and previously notified to the Commission under Regulation (EEC) No 75/91, as set out in Annex I hereto, with a view to its processing into either broken rice within the meaning of Annex A point 3 to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 or products derived therefrom, or into some other form suitable for use in animal feed (CN code 2309 ).", "1.
