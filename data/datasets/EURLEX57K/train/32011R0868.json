Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) The applications concern the authorisation of a preparation of Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 21762) and of a preparation of Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 22963) as feed additives for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 15\u00a0March 2011\u00a0(2) that Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 21762) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that this preparation has the potential to improve the production of silage from all forages by reducing the pH and increasing the preservation of dry matter. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 7\u00a0April 2011\u00a0(3) that Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 22963) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that this preparation has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing acetic acid production. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of the preparation of Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 21762) and of the preparation of Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 22963) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparations specified in Annex belonging to the additive category \u2018technological additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018silage additives\u2019, are authorised as additives in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(3):2113.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(4):2138.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method.
