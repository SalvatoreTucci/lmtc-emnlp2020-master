The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019.\n(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof, and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned.\n(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.\n(5) Following an application from Cargill Incorporated, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and requesting the protection of proprietary data for one meta-analysis\u00a0(2) and for information pertaining to the production process of barley \u2018betafiber\u2019 (BarlivTM), the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of barley beta-glucans on lowering of blood cholesterol and reduced risk of (coronary) heart disease (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00798)\u00a0(3). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Barley beta-glucan has been shown to lower/reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of (coronary) heart disease\u2019.\n(6) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 8 December 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of barley beta-glucans and lowering of blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims. The meta-analysis and information pertaining to the production process of barley \u2018betafiber\u2019 (BarlivTM), claimed by the applicant as proprietary, were not considered necessary by the Authority for reaching its conclusion. It is therefore considered that the requirement laid down in point (c) of Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is not fulfilled and accordingly, protection of proprietary data should not be granted.\n(7) Following an application from Valens Int. d.o.o., submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of barley beta-glucans on lowering of blood cholesterol and reduced risk of (coronary) heart disease (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00799)\u00a0(4). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Barley beta-glucan has been shown to reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of heart disease\u2019.\n(8) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 8 December 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of barley beta-glucans and lowering of blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims.\n(9) Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that an opinion in favour of authorising a health claim should include certain particulars. Accordingly, those particulars should be set out in the Annex to this Regulation as regards the authorised claim and include, as the case may be, the revised wording of the claim, specific conditions of use of the claim, and, where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use of the food and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinions of the Authority.\n(10) One of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is to ensure that health claims are truthful, clear and reliable and useful to the consumer, and that wording and presentation are taken into account in that respect. Therefore where the wording of claims has the same meaning for consumers as that of an authorised health claim, because they demonstrate the same relationship that exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health, they should be subject to the same conditions of use indicated in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(11) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The health claim listed in the Annex to this Regulation may be made on foods on the European Union market in compliance with the conditions laid down in that Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The health claim referred to in paragraph 1 shall be included in the Union list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 November 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Harland JI, 2011 (unpublished); Meta-analysis of the effects of barley beta-glucan on blood lipids.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2011); 9(12):2470.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0The EFSA Journal (2011); 9(12):2471.\nANNEX\nPermitted health claim\nApplication \u2014 Relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Applicant \u2014 Address Nutrient, substance, food or food category Claim Conditions of use of the claim Conditions and/or restrictions of use of the food and/or additional statement or warning EFSA opinion reference\nArticle 14(1)(a) health claim referring to a reduction of a disease risk Cargill Incorporated, acting through Cargill Health and Nutrition, c/o Cargill R & D Centre Europe, Havenstraat 84, 1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium Barley beta-glucan Barley beta-glucan has been shown to lower/reduce blood cholesterol.
