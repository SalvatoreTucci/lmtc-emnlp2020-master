Recent studies have found that those two denominations cover in fact one single species of harmful organism. For the purposes of this Decision it is therefore appropriate to use the single revised scientific denomination Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) to designate what is listed in that Annex as Anoplophora malasiaca (Forster) and Anoplophora chinensis (Thomson).\n(2) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, where a Member State considers that there is a danger of introduction into or spread within its territory of a harmful organism whether or not listed in Annexes I or II to that Directive, it may temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger.\n(3) As a result of the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) on various host plants in the region of Lombardy, Italy informed the Commission and the other Member States on 23 November 2007 that it had adopted additional measures on 9 November 2007 to prevent the further introduction into and spread within its territory of that organism.\n(4) As a result of findings of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) on various host plants in the Netherlands, the Commission and other Member States were informed on 21 January 2008 of the measures taken to eradicate that organism in the Netherlands.\n(5) Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) has been recently intercepted on many consignments of plants for planting of Acer spp. originating in third countries. At present, there are no special requirements in relation to this harmful organism for plants of Acer spp., nor for other plants which are amongst the most susceptible hosts plants, originating in third countries or in the Community.\n(6) A pest risk analysis on Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) was released in 2008 by the Netherlands, which concluded that there is a very high probability of establishment of the organism in the Community and a high potential of economic damage to several host plants.\n(7) It is therefore necessary to take emergency measures against the introduction into and spread within the Community of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster). The measures should apply to a list of plants of any origin, the \u2018specified plants\u2019, known to be hosts of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) and which present the highest risk of being infested.\n(8) Measures should be defined for the import of the specified plants as regards their production in third countries and inspections at entry into the Community. Measures should also be defined for the production, movement and control of the specified plants originating in areas in the Community where the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) is confirmed.\n(9) Detailed measures should be laid down in areas in the Community where the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) is confirmed, i.e. the infested zones. In those zones, appropriate measures to eradicate the organism and intensive monitoring of its presence should be applied. In the areas surrounding such areas, i.e. the buffer zones, intensive monitoring for the presence of the organism should take place. In case of the first detection of the organism in an area in the Community, the size of the relevant buffer zone might be reduced to reflect better the more limited risk of spreading.\n(10) A survey to check for the presence or continued absence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) should be carried out on host plants in all Member States.\n(11) It is appropriate that the measures be reviewed by 31 May 2009 taking into account the availability, after one growing season, of the results of the official surveys and examinations by Member States of specified plants imported and being moved within the Community under the emergency measures.\n(12) Member States should, if necessary, adapt their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018specified plants\u2019 means plants for planting, other than seeds, of Acer spp., Aesculus hippocastanum, Alnus spp., Betula spp., Carpinus spp., Citrus spp., Corylus spp., Cotoneaster spp., Fagus spp., Lagerstroemia spp., Malus spp., Platanus spp., Populus spp., Prunus spp., Pyrus spp., Salix spp., and Ulmus spp.;\n(b) \u2018place of production\u2019 means the place of production as defined in the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 5\u00a0(2).", "Import of the specified plants\nSpecified plants imported from third countries where Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) is known to be present, may only be introduced into the Community if:\n(a) they comply with the specific import requirements in point (1) of Section I of Annex I;\n(b) without prejudice to Article 13a(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, on entry into the Community they are inspected by the responsible official body in accordance with point (2) of Section I of Annex I to this Decision for the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster), and no signs of that organism have been found.", "Movement of specified plants within the Community\nSpecified plants originating in demarcated areas within the Community established in accordance with Article 5 may be moved within the Community only if they meet the conditions set out in point (1) of Section II of Annex I.\nSpecified plants imported in accordance with Article 2 from third countries where Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) is known to be present, may be moved within the Community only if they meet the conditions set out in point (2) of Section II of Annex I.", "Surveys\nMember States shall conduct official annual surveys for the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) and for the evidence of infestation by that organism on host plants in their territory.\nWithout prejudice to Article 16(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of those surveys, together with the list and delimitation of demarcated areas referred to in Article 5 of this Decision, shall be notified to the Commission and to the other Member States by 30 April of each year.", "Demarcated areas\nWhen the results of the surveys referred to in Article 4 confirm the presence of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) in an area, or there is evidence of the presence of that organism by other means, Member States shall define demarcated areas, which shall consist of infested zone and of buffer zone, in accordance with Section 1 of Annex II.\nThe Member States shall take official measures in the demarcated areas as laid down in Section 2 of Annex II.", "Compliance\nMember States shall take all measures to comply with this Decision and, if necessary, amend the measures which they have adopted to protect themselves against the introduction and spread of Anoplophora chinensis (Forster) in such a manner that those measures comply with this Decision.
