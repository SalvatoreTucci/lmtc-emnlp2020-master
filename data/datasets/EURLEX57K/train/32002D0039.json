Following the European Council meetings in Helsinki in December 1999 and, in particular, in Nice in December 2000, the case-by-case approach in this field could be shifted to a more far-reaching one embracing most of the Community programmes.\n(3) The Helsinki European Council stated that the Republic of Malta is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to the other candidate countries. Building on the existing European strategy, the Republic of Malta, like other candidate countries, benefits from a pre-accession strategy to prepare for accession, including the opportunity to participate in Community programmes and agencies.\n(4) In accordance with the negotiating directives adopted by the Council on 5 June 2001, the Commission has negotiated on behalf of the Community a Framework Agreement with the Republic of Malta on the general principles for its participation in Community programmes.\n(5) With regard to some of the programmes covered by the Agreement, the Treaty provides for no powers other than those under Article 308.\n(6) The specific terms and conditions regarding the participation of the Republic of Malta in the Community programmes, in particular the financial contribution payable, should be determined by the Commission on behalf to the Community. For that purpose the Commission should be assisted by a special committee appointed by the Council.\n(7) The Republic of Malta may apply for financial assistance for participation in Community programmes under Council Regulation (EC) No 555/2000 of 13 March 2000 on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Malta(3).\n(8) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the EC Treaty, is not participating in the part of this Council decision adopted with reference to Title IV of the EC Treaty, and Denmark is not bound by this part of this Council decision nor subject to its application.\n(9) The United Kingdom and Ireland intend to participate in the adoption of the Council Regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters and when it is adopted, the United Kingdom and Ireland will be bound by it and subject to its application. In respect of any future Community instrument adopted under Title IV of the EC Treaty, implementing or establishing any future Community programme, the United Kingdom and Ireland will only be bound by the part relating to Title IV of the EC Treaty in this Council decision and subject to its application, if the United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by that instrument in accordance with the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the EC Treaty.\n(10) The Agreement should be reviewed by the Commission at regular intervals.\n(11) The Agreement should be approved,", "main_body": ["The Framework Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Malta on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Malta in Community programmes, is hereby approved on behalf of the Community.\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.", "1.
