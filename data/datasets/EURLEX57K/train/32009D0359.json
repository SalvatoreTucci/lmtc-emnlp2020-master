In order to be considered as sufficiently low to be of insignificant human and ecological risk, the content of these substances shall not exceed national threshold values for sites identified as not contaminated or relevant national natural background levels;\n(e) the waste is substantially free of products used in extraction or processing that could harm the environment or human health.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waste may be considered as inert waste without specific testing if it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, that the criteria set out in paragraph 1 have been adequately considered and are met on the strength of existing information or valid procedures or schemes.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States may draw up lists of waste materials to be regarded as inert in accordance with the criteria defined in paragraphs 1 and 2.", "The assessment of the inert property of waste in accordance with this Decision shall be completed in the framework of the waste characterisation referred in Decision 2009/360/EC and shall be based on the same sources of information.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nStavros DIMAS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0102, 11.4.2006, p.\u00a015.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0See page 48 of this Official Journal.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0114, 27.4.2006, p.\u00a09."}
