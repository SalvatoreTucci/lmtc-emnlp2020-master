The latter having been modified several times along the two last years, the Community standard should be updated accordingly.\n(3) The degree of ripeness and, accordingly, the taste quality, of table grapes is directly correlated to the sugar content, as well as to the ratio between acidity and sugar content, measured on the produce concerned. In order to avoid that table grapes of insufficient quality are marketed, minimum sugar content values should be laid down, as well as a general requirement with regards to the sugar-acidity ratio.\n(4) The provisions concerning sizing of table grapes are complex because of the existence of three different lists of varieties in the Appendix to the standard. In order to simplify the text, two of the three lists of varieties shall be deleted.\n(5) It is necessary accordingly to amend Regulation (EC) No 2789/1999.\n(6) In order to apply the provisions of the present Regulation, the traders have to comply with certain technical adaptations, in particular with regard to their packing facilities. The application of the present Regulation shall therefore start after a period of a sufficient length after the date of its entry into force.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2789/1999 is amended according to the Annex to the present Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt is applicable from the first day of the third month following its entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 336, 29.12.1999, p. 13.\n(4) OJ L 100, 11.4.2001, p. 9.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2789/1999 is amended as follows.\n1.
