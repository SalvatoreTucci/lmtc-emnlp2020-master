whereas there should be a reinforcement of those measures designed to ensure that the Community funds intended for the implementation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) are not granted to persons or companies which do not offer all the guarantees of reliability as to the proper execution of the operations concerned;\nWhereas Article 8 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(4), lays down, in particular, that Member States are under an obligation to take all the measures necessary to ensure that transactions financed by the Fund are actually carried out and properly executed, and to prevent and follow up irregularities;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 595/91 of 4 March 1991 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the common agricultural policy and the organization of an information system in this field and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 283/72\u00a0(5), provides, among other things, for the Member States regularly to inform the Commission of cases of irregularities and judicial or administrative procedures sanctioning persons who have committed irregularities, in order to acquire systematic knowledge of the nature of the fraudulent practices and to recover sums wrongly paid;\nWhereas these provisions need to be supplemented by a Community system allowing all the national authorities to identify, in connection with tendering procedures, grant of export refunds or sales at reduced prices of intervention products, operators who have deliberately or as a result of serious negligence committed an irregularity prejudicial to Community funds or who are suspected on solid grounds of having done so; whereas, on that basis, there must be determined, in the light of the seriousness of the offence and depending on whether it has been established or suspected, a series of varied measures ranging from reinforced controls to the exclusion of the operators concerned from taking part in operations to be determined when their fraudulent actions are established;\nWhereas, in order to provide operators with a maximum of guarantees, it would be advisable to adopt the essential features of the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 595/91, in particular with regard to the observance of confidentiality and professional secrecy and the national rules relating to criminal proceedings; whereas, with regard to data protection, the relevant provisions laid down for that purpose in the rules on mutual assistance in customs and agricultural matters may be applied;\nWhereas this system must be supplementary to the specific provisions already existing or to be adopted in the future under the CAP with a view to preventing irregularities, in particular those provisions relating to controls and sanctions established by the Commission by virtue of its powers confirmed by the Court of Justice;\nWhereas, furthermore, as part of an across-the-board campaign against fraud, on 7 July 1994 the Commission submitted a proposal for a Regulation (EC, Euratom) on protection of the Community's financial interests\u00a0(6), whereas, on the adoption of that Regulation by the Council, the common set of legal rules enacted by it for all areas of Community policy will apply to the measures introduced by this Regulation; whereas, until that Regulation is adopted, provision should be made for the detailed rules for the application of this Regulation temporarily to include similar rules, in particular as regards the definition of the irregularities involved,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Community system is hereby established for the purpose of identifying and making known as rapidly as possible to all the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission operators presenting, on the grounds of experience acquired with them as regards the proper execution of their previous obligations, a risk of non-reliability in connection with tendering procedures, export refunds and sales at reduced prices or intervention products, financed by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Regulation, \u2018operators presenting a risk of non-reliability\u2019 means operators, whether natural or legal persons, who:\n(a) according to a final decision of an administrative or judicial authority, have deliberately or through serious negligence committed an irregularity in respect of relevant Community provisions and have unjustly benefited from a financial advantage or attempted to benefit therefrom;\n(b) have been the subject, in this respect, on the basis of established facts, of a preliminary administrative or judicial report by the competent authorities of the Member State.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pending the entry into force of horizontal provisions defining irregularities, the conduct referred to in paragraph 2 (a) shall be defined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The identification procedures and rules relating to notification shall be implemented on the initiative of the Member State in which the risk of the operator's non-reliability is identified.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a Member State fails to fulfil its obligation under paragraph 1 the Commission shall, within the framework of the existing legal provisions, ensure that the identification and notification system is implemented by the Member State concerned.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take the following measures to deal with the operators referred to in Article 1 (2) (a):\n(a) reinforced checking of all operations performed by the operator, and/or\n(b) suspension, going as far as an administrative determination of the existence of an irregularity or of the absence of an irregularity, of payment of amounts relating to current operations, to be determined, and, where appropriate, of release of the guarantee relating thereto, and/or\n(c) their exclusion for a period of time from operations to be determined.\nThe measures referred to under points (b) and (c) shall be determined by the competent authorities of the Member State in accordance with criteria laid down in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 5, having due regard to the risk of further irregularities that may be committed by the operator.
