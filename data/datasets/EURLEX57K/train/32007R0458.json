On\u00a020\u00a0October\u00a02003 the Council agreed that streamlining would come into effect from\u00a02006 onwards. In this context, an annual Joint Report became the core reporting instrument, with the task of bringing together the key analytical findings and political messages pertaining both to the Open\u00a0Method of Coordination (OMC) in the different strands where it is applied and to cross-cutting issues in social protection.\n(5) The OMC has placed new emphasis on the need for comparable, timely and reliable statistics in the social policy area. In particular, comparable statistics on social protection are used in the annual Joint Reports.\n(6) The Commission (Eurostat) already collects annual data on social protection from the Member States on a voluntary basis. This practice has become established in the Member\u00a0States and is based on common methodological principles designed to ensure the comparability of data.\n(7) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council\u00a0Regulation (EC) No\u00a0322/97 of 17\u00a0February\u00a01997 on Community Statistics\u00a0(4).\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28\u00a0June\u00a01999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(5).\n(9) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to decide the first year for which full data should be collected on net social protection benefits. Power should also be conferred on the Commission to adopt measures relating to the detailed classification of data covered, the definitions to be used and the updating of the rules on dissemination. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article\u00a05a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(10) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\u00a0States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(11) There is existing cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the field of net social protection benefits.\n(12) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(6) has been consulted,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThe objective of this Regulation is to set up the European system of integrated social protection statistics (hereinafter referred to as ESSPROS), by providing:\n(a) a methodological framework based on common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules to be used for compiling statistics on a comparable basis for the benefit of the Community;\n(b) time limits for the transmission of statistics compiled in accordance with ESSPROS.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018Community statistics\u2019 shall have the meaning assigned to it in Article\u00a02 of Regulation\u00a0(EC) No\u00a0322/97;\n(b) \u2018Social protection\u2019: all interventions from public or private bodies intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of risks or needs, provided that neither a simultaneous reciprocal arrangement nor an individual arrangement is involved.
