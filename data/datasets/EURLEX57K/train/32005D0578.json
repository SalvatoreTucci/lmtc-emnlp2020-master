The spat, shell-on scallops and scallop meat imported from Canada will provisionally replace the supply of raw scallops that the local processing industry currently lacks.\n(3) The requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC, and in particular Article 37(1) thereof, especially as regards the development of an existing industry in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The derogation is essential for the preservation of the activity of the plant in question, which employs a significant number of people. Subject to compliance with certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration, the derogation would not cause serious injury to an established industry of the Community or one or more of the Member States.\n(4) A derogation should therefore be granted in respect of certain quantities of meat of scallops of the genus Placopecten magellanicus processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon and imported into the Community.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2) lays down rules for the management of tariff quotas. Those rules should be applied mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities in respect of which the derogation in question is granted.\n(6) In view of the expiry of Decision 2001/822/EC on 31 December 2011, provision should be made to ensure the derogation\u2019s validity beyond that date if a new decision is adopted on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community or if Decision 2001/822/EC is extended.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC, fresh and frozen meat of scallops of the genus Placopecten magellanicus falling with CN code 0307 and described in the Annex which are processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon shall be regarded as originating in Saint Pierre and Miquelon where they are obtained from non-originating spat, shell-on scallops and scallop meat, in accordance with the terms of this Decision.", "The derogation provided for in Article 1 shall apply to the quantities shown in the Annex which are imported into the Community from Saint Pierre and Miquelon during the period from 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2012.", "Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 relating to the management of tariff quotas shall apply mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities referred to in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customs authorities of Saint Pierre and Miquelon shall take the necessary steps to carry out quantitative checks on exports of the products referred to in Article 1.
