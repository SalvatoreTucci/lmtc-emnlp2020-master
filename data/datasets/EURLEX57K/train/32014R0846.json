Since the collection of semen of animals of the equine species is largely seasonal, the required permanence of the supervision by a centre veterinarian, frequently being contracted by the semen collection centre, appeared to be disproportionate compared to the limited added level of confidence in the animal health guarantees. As long as supervision is guaranteed during the activities of the semen collection centre in respect of semen of animals of the equine species intended for trade the competent authorities should be allowed to establish details of that supervision during the approval process.\n(3) Directive 92/65/EEC also provides that semen of donor animals of the equine species must have been collected from animals meeting the conditions laid down in Chapter II(I) of Annex D to that Directive. Those conditions should be reviewed as regards donor stallions taking into account international standards for health testing set up in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals\u00a0(2), and the capacity development in laboratories in the Member States.\n(4) In accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), the competent authorities may only designate laboratories to carry out the analysis of samples taken during official controls that operate and are assessed and accredited in accordance with EN ISO/IEC 17025.\n(5) In Chapter III of Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC requirements applicable to, amongst others, processing of embryos are laid down. Those requirements should be reviewed taking into account international standards for processing of embryos set out in Chapter 4.7 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code\u00a0(4).\n(6) The recent update of Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC by Commission Regulation (EU) No 176/2010\u00a0(5) did not sufficiently take into account the discontinuous nature of collection of semen, ova and embryos of the equine species for trade and thus frequent testing of donor stallions is unnecessarily required. Additionally, since its adoption laboratory capacities to carry out advanced, highly sensitive, but less laborious tests for contagious equine metritis and equine viral arteritis have developed.\n(7) Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC should be therefore amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 14.9.1992, p.\u00a054.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, Edition 2013, World Organisation for Animal Health.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (OJ L\u00a0165, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Edition 2013, World Organisation for Animal Health.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EU) No 176/2010 of 2 March 2010 amending Annex D to Council Directive 92/65/EEC as regards semen collection and storage centres, embryo collection and production teams, and conditions for donor animals of the equine, ovine and caprine species and for handling semen, ova and embryos of those species (OJ L\u00a052, 3.3.2010, p.\u00a014).\nANNEX\nAnnex D to Directive 92/65/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1) In Chapter I(I), point 1.1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.1. be placed under the supervision of a centre veterinarian authorised by the competent authority;\u2019\n(2) Chapter II(I) is amended as follows:\n(a) point 1.5 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.5. it shall be subjected to the following tests, carried out and certified in a laboratory which is recognised by the competent authority and has the tests referred to hereinafter included in its accreditation in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(1), according to the programme provided for in point 1.6:\n(a) an agar-gel immuno-diffusion test (Coggins test) or an ELISA for equine infectious anaemia with negative result;\n(b) a test for the isolation of the equine arteritis virus or the detection of its genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR carried out with negative result on an aliquot of the entire semen of the donor stallion, unless the donor stallion has reacted with negative result at a serum dilution of one in four in a serum neutralisation test for equine viral arteritis;\n(c) an agent identification test for contagious equine metritis, carried out with negative result in each case on three specimens (swabs) taken from the donor stallion on two occasions with an interval of not less than seven days, and in no case earlier than seven days (systemic treatment) or 21 days (local treatment) after possible antimicrobial treatment of the donor stallion, from at least the following sites:\n\u2014 the penile sheath (prepuce),\n\u2014 the urethra,\n\u2014 the fossa glandis.\n(i) culture under microaerophilic conditions for at least 7 days for the isolation of Taylorella equigenitalis, set up within 24 hours after taking the specimens from the donor animal, or 48 hours where the specimens are kept cool during transport;
