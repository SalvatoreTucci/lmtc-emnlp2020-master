Fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the Community and registered in that Member State shall be authorized to operate in Greenland waters subject to the conditions laid down by the Parties to this Agreement in the implementation Protocols.\n2. The catch possibilities under paragraph 1 shall be fixed at a quantity which, taking into account the position regarding stocks, ensures that Community fishing activities in the Greenland fishing zone are carried out in a satisfactory manner.\nThe catch quantities fixed for the Community in the first implementation Protocol and the way in which stocks develop shall constitute a reference basis for fixing future catch possibilities.\n3. The fishing quotas allocated to the Community under paragraph 1 may be taken by vessels which do not fly the flag of a Member State of the Community to the extent to which this is necessary for the proper functioning of the fisheries agreements concluded by the Community with third countries and on the terms agreed between the Parties.\nArticle 3\nThe competent authorities of the Community shall, in due course, notify the authorities responsible for  (1) OJ No L 378, 31.12.1982, p. 25.  Greenland of the names, registration numbers and other essential characteristics of fishing vessels which may be authorized to fish within the area of fisheries jurisdiction of Greenland. The authorities responsible for Greenland shall then issue to vessels designated by the Community licences commensurate with the fishing possibilities granted in accordance with Article 2.\nArticle 4\n1. The authorities responsible for Greenland shall take all the measures necessary to ensure conservation and rational management of stocks and regulation of fisheries within the area of fisheries jurisdiction of Greenland.\nTo this end, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, they shall implement measures corresponding to those in force the previous day.\n2. Community fishing vessels shall, when fishing within the area of fisheries jurisdiction of Greenland, comply with the conservation measures, other terms and conditions, and all rules and regulations governing fishing activities in that area, as provided in paragraph 1.\n3. The authorities responsible for Greenland shall notify in advance and in due time all new measures, terms, rules or regulations.\n4. The provisions adopted pursuant to this Article and the controls carried out to ensure compliance with them shall take into account the need not to compromise the catch possibilities agreed.\nArticle 5\n1. The authorities responsible for Greenland may take within the area of fisheries jurisdiction of Greenland such measures in conformity with international law as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by vessels of the Community.\n2. The authorities of the Community shall take all necessary measures to ensure compliance by these vessels with the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant rules.\nArticle 6\nIn return for the catch possibilities utilized under this Agreement, the Community shall pay Greenland financial compensation as fixed in the Protocols referred to in Article 2 (1).\nArticle 7\nWhere, for a given fishing year, biological circumstances require the total volume of catches from a particular stock to be fixed at a level which does not permit Greenland to meet the obligation arising from Article 2 and, at the same time, to maintain its fishing activities at a level corresponding to minimum quantities laid down in the Protocols referred to in Article 2 (1), the corresponding quotas agreed with the Community for the stock or stocks concerned shall be reduced accordingly, without this reduction affecting the level of the financial compensation referred to in Article 6.\nThe Parties shall hold consultations to examine the situation as regards stocks and appropriate measures for encouraging their reconstitution as well as to seek ways and means whereby the abovementioned quotas may be transferred to other stocks, other species or subsequent years.\nArticle 8\n1. A special priority for the Community on access to supplementary catch possibilities, which exceed the catch capacities of the Greenland fleet and the annual quotas agreed for the Community under the Protocols referred to in Article 2 (1), shall be offered by the authorities responsible for Greenland in the light of the special interests of the Community in the exploitation of the stocks concerned and bearing in mind its contribution to their conservation and its participation in the development of Greenland.\n2. In allocating the supplementary catch possibilities referred to in paragraph 1, the authorities responsible for Greenland shall offer to the Community, against appropriate payment, quantities which correspond, for cod of the western stock of Greenland, to at least 20 % of an increase in the TAC above 75 000 tonnes.\nArticle 9\nThe Parties undertake to cooperate, either directly or within international organizations, to ensure proper management and conservation of stocks in which they have a mutual interest and to facilitate the necessary scientific research.\nArticle 10\nShould the position of one the Parties deteriorate substantially because of a serious violation by the other Party of the undertakings given in this Agreement, the  Parties shall hold consultations without delay with a view to restoring balance to their relations on fisheries matters. Where a satisfactory solution has not been found within two months, the Party which considers its interest to have suffered may suspend application of the Agreement.\nArticle 11\nNothing in this Agreement shall affect or prejudice in any manner the views of either Party with respect to any matter relating to the Law of the Sea.\nArticle 12\nThis Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to Greenland.\nArticle 13\nThis Agreement shall enter into force on the date of entry into force of the Treaty amending, with regard to Greenland, the Treaties establishing the European Communities. The Parties shall notify each other of completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose.\nArticle 14\nThe Parties shall hold consultations on matters relating to the implementation and proper functioning of this Agreement and of the Protocols concluded for its implementation and, in good time before the date of expiry of those Protocols, with a view to determining the fishing arrangements for the following period.\nArticle 15\nThis Agreement shall be concluded for a period of 10 years running from the date of its entry into force. Should the Agreement not be terminated by either Party through notice of termination given at least nine months before the date of expiry of the 10-year period, it shall remain in force for additional periods of six years, provided that notice of termination has not been given at least nine months prior to the expiry of each period.\nArticle 16\nThis Agreement is drawn up in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek and Italian languages, each text being equally authentic.\nUdf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxelles, den trettende marts nitten hundrede og fireogfirs.\nGeschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am dreizehnten M\u00e4rz neunzehnhundertvierundachtzig. >PIC FILE= \"T0027985\">\nDone at Brussels on the thirteenth day of March in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-four.\nFait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le treize mars mil neuf cent quatre-vingt-quatre.\nFatto a Bruxelles, add\u00ec tredici marzo millenovecentottantaquattro.\nGedaan te Brussel, de dertiende maart negentienhonderd vierentachtig.\nFor R\u00e5det for De europ\u00e6iske F\u00e6llesskaber\nF\u00fcr den Rat der Europ\u00e4ischen Gemeinschaften >PIC FILE= \"T0027986\">\nFor the Council of the European Communities\nPour le Conseil des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes\nPer il Consiglio delle Comunit\u00e0 europee\nVoor de Raad van de Europese Gemeenschappen >PIC FILE= \"T0027987\">\nFor den danske regering og det gr\u00f8nlandske landsstyre\nF\u00fcr die Regierung D\u00e4nemarks und die \u00f6rtliche Regierung Gr\u00f6nlands >PIC FILE= \"T0027988\">\nFor the Government of Denmark and the local Government of Greenland\nPour le gouvernement du Danemark et le gouvernement local du Groenland\nPer il governo della Danimarca ed il governo locale della Groenlandia\nVoor de Regering van Denemarken en de Plaatselijke Regering van Groenland >PIC FILE= \"T0027989\">"}
