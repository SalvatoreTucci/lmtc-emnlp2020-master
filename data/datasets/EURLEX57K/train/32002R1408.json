The improvements entered into force as from 1 July 2000 in the form of Council Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 of 31 July 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary(3). The second adjustment of the relevant provisions in the Europe Agreement, which will take the form of another Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement, has not yet entered into force.\n(4) A new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement on trade liberalisation for agricultural products has been negotiated.\n(5) A swift implementation of the adjustments forms an essential part of the results of the negotiations for the conclusion of a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement with Hungary. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 should therefore be repealed.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4) has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Tariff quotas under this Regulation should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules.\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5),", "main_body": ["1.

In the case of a customs declaration value being lower than the minimum import price, a countervailing duty will be charged equal to the difference between the minimum import price and the customs declaration value.\n3. If the import prices of a given product covered by this Appendix show a trend suggesting that the prices could go below the level of the minimum import prices in the immediate future, the European Commission will inform the Hungarian authorities in order to enable them to correct the situation.\n4. At the request of either the Community or Hungary, the Association Committee shall examine the functioning of the system or the revision of the level of the minimum import prices. If appropriate, the Association Committee shall take the necessary decisions.\n5. To encourage and promote the development of trade and for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned, a consultation meeting may be organised three months before the beginning of each marketing year in the European Community. This consultation meeting will take place between the European Commission and the interested European producers' organisations for the products concerned, on the one part and the authorities', producers' and exporters' organisations of all the associated exporting countries, on the other part.\nDuring this consultation meeting, the market situation for soft fruit including, in particular, forecasts for production, stock situation, price evolution and possible market development, as well as possibilities to adapt supply to demand, will be discussed."}
