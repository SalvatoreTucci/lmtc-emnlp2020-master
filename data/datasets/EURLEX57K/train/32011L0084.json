It should therefore be possible to continue to use hydrogen peroxide in that concentration in oral products, including tooth whitening or bleaching products.\n(3) The SCCS considers that the use of tooth whitening or bleaching products containing more than 0,1\u00a0% and up to 6\u00a0% of hydrogen peroxide present or released from other compounds or mixtures in these products may be safe if the following conditions are satisfied: an appropriate clinical examination is carried out in order to ensure there are no risk factors or any other oral pathology of concern and that exposure to these products is limited so as to ensure that the products are used only as intended in terms of frequency and duration of application. These conditions should be fulfilled in order to avoid reasonably foreseeable misuse.\n(4) Those products should therefore be regulated in a way that ensures that they are not directly available to the consumer. For each cycle of use of those products, the first use should be limited to dental practitioners, as defined under Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications\u00a0(3) or under their direct supervision if an equivalent level of safety is ensured. Dental practitioners should then provide access to those products for the rest of the cycle of use.\n(5) An appropriate labelling regarding the concentration in hydrogen peroxide of the tooth whitening or bleaching products containing more than 0,1\u00a0% of this substance should be provided for in order to ensure the appropriate use of these products. For this purpose, the exact concentration in percentage of hydrogen peroxide present or released from other compounds and mixtures in those products should be clearly indicated on the label.\n(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before 30 October 2012 Member States shall adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
