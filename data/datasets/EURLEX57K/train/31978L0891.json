Markings in imperial (UK) units shall be in letters and figures of dimensions not larger than those of the corresponding markings in SI units.\n4. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PACKER OR IMPORTER\nThe packer or importer shall be responsible for ensuring that prepackages meet the requirements of this Directive.\nThe quantity of liquid contained in a prepackage, known as the actual volume of the contents, shall be measured or checked on the responsibility of the packer or the importer. The measurement or check shall be carried out by means of a legal measuring instrument suitable for effecting the necessary operations.\nThe check may be carried out by sampling.\nWhere the actual volume of the contents is not measured, the check carried out by the packer shall be so organized that the nominal volume of the said contents is effectively ensured, in conformity with the provisions of this Directive.\nIn order to fulfil this requirement, the packer must carry out production checks in accordance with procedures recognized by the competent departments in the Member State and if he holds at the disposal of these authorities the documents containing the results of such checks, in order to certify that these checks, together with the corrections and adjustments which they have shown to be necessary, have been properly and accurately carried out.\nWhere goods are imported from non-EEC countries, the importer may, instead of measuring and checking, provide evidence that he is in possession of all the necessary guarantees enabling him to assume responsibility.\nOne of the several methods of meeting the measuring and checking requirement is to use when making up the prepackage a measuring container of the type defined in the Directive relating thereto and filled under the conditions prescribed in this Directive and in that on measuring container bottles.\n5. CHECKS TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPETENT DEPARTMENTS ON THE PREMISES OF THE PACKER OR OF THE IMPORTER OR OF HIS AGENT ESTABLISHED IN THE COMMUNITY\nChecks to ensure that the prepackages comply with the provisions of this Directive shall be carried out by the competent departments of the Member States by sampling on the packer's premises or, if this is not practicable, on the premises of the importer or of his agent established in the Community.\nThis statistical sampling check shall be carried out in accordance with the accepted methods of quality acceptance inspection.

REQUIREMENTS FOR MEASURING THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF PREPACKAGES\nThe actual contents of prepackages may be measured directly by means of weighing instruments or volumetric instruments or, in the case of liquids, indirectly, by weighing the prepacked product and measuring its density.\nIrrespective of the method used, the error made in measuring the actual contents of a prepackage shall not exceed one-fifth of the tolerable negative error for the nominal quantity in the prepackage.\nThe procedure for measuring the actual contents of a prepackage may be the subject of domestic regulations in each Member State.\n2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CHECKING BATCHES OF PREPACKAGES\nThe checking of prepackages shall be carried out by sampling and shall be in two parts:      - a check covering the actual contents of each prepackage in the sample,\n- another check on the average of the actual contents of the prepackages in the sample.\nA batch of prepackages shall be considered acceptable if the results of both these checks satisfy the acceptance criteria.\nFor each of these checks, there are two sampling plans:      - one for non-destructive testing, i.e., testing which does not involve opening the package,\n- the other for destructive testing, i.e., testing which involves opening or destroying the package.\nFor economic and practical reasons, the latter test shall be limited to the absolutely essential minimum ; it is less effective than the non-destructive test.\nDestructive testing shall therefore be used only when non-destructive testing is impracticable. As a general rule it shall not be applied to batches of fewer than 100 units.      2.1. Prepackage batches        2.1.1. The batch shall comprise all the prepackages of the same nominal quantity, the same type and the same production run, packed in the same place, which are to be inspected. The batch size shall be limited to the amounts laid down below.\n2.1.2. When prepackages are checked at the end of the packing line, the number in each batch shall be equal to the maximum hourly output of the packing line, without any restriction as to batch size.\nIn other cases the batch size shall be limited to 10 000.\n2.1.3. For batches of fewer than 100 prepackages, the non-destructive test, where carried out, shall be 100 %.\n2.1.4. Before the tests in 2.2 and 2.3 are carried out, a sufficient number of prepackages shall be drawn at random from the batch so that the check requiring the larger sample can be carried out.\nFor the other check, the necessary sample shall be drawn at random from the first sample and marked.\nThis marking operation shall be completed before the start of measuring operations.\n2.2. Checking of the actual contents of a prepackage\nThe minimum acceptable contents shall be calculated by subtracting the tolerable negative error for the contents concerned from the nominal quantity of the prepackage.\nPrepackages in the batch whose actual contents are less than the minimum acceptable contents shall be considered defective.        2.2.1. Non-destructive testing\nNon-destructive testing shall be carried out in accordance with a double sampling plan as shown in the table below:\nThe first number of prepackages checked shall be equal to the number of units in the first sample, as indicated in the plan:          - if the number of defective units found in the first sample is less than or equal to the first acceptance criterion, the batch shall be considered acceptable for the purpose of this check,\n- if the number of defective units found in the first sample is equal to or greater than the first rejection criterion, the batch shall be rejected,\n- if the number of defective units found in the first sample lies between the first acceptance criterion and the first rejection criterion, a second sample shall be checked, the number of units in which is indicated in the plan.\nThe defective units found in the first and second samples shall be added together and:          - if the aggregate number of defective units is less than or equal to the second acceptance criterion, the batch shall be considered acceptable for the purpose of this check,\n- if the aggregate number of defective units is greater than or equal to the second rejection criterion, the batch shall be rejected. >PIC FILE= \"T0013506\">\n2.2.2. Destructive testing\nDestructive testing shall be carried out in accordance with the single sampling plan below and shall be used only for batches of 100 or more.\nThe number of prepackages checked shall be equal to 20.          - If the number of defective units found in the sample is less than or equal to the acceptance criterion, the batch of prepackages shall be considered as acceptable.\n- If the number of defective units found in the sample is equal to or greater than the rejection criterion, the batch of prepackages shall be rejected. >PIC FILE= \"T0013507\">"}
