Article 9 of that Directive lays down criteria for the approval of compulsory national control programmes for certain contagious diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease. In addition, Article 10 of that Directive provides that where a Member State considers its territory or part thereof to be free of such diseases, including Aujeszky\u2019s disease, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission.\n(2) Commission Decision 2008/185/EC of 21 February 2008 on additional guarantees in intra-Community trade of pigs relating to Aujeszky\u2019s disease and criteria to provide information on this disease\u00a0(2) lays down the additional guarantees for movements of pigs between Member States. Those guarantees are linked to the classification of Member States according to their Aujeszky\u2019s disease status.\n(3) Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC lists Member States or regions thereof which are free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited. Annex II to that Decision lists Member States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky\u2019s disease are in place.\n(4) In Poland and Spain national control programmes for Aujeszky\u2019s disease have been implemented for several years. For several Spanish regions the national control programme for Aujeszky\u2019s disease is already approved by Commission Decision 2007/603/EC\u00a0(3).\n(5) Slovenia has submitted supporting documentation to the Commission as regards the Aujeszky\u2019s disease-free status of the territory of Slovenia demonstrating that the disease has never been detected in that Member State.\n(6) The Commission has examined the documentation submitted by Slovenia and found it to comply with the requirements of Article 10(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. Accordingly, that Member State should be included in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2008/185/EC. That Annex should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Poland has submitted supporting documentation to the Commission as regards the programme in place in the whole territory of Poland and requested the approval of this programme.\n(8) Spain has now submitted supporting documentation to the Commission as regards the programme in place in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Balearic Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, Extremadura, Madrid, Region of Murcia, Community of Valencia, and the provinces of Salamanca, Segovia and Soria in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y Le\u00f3n and the province of Tenerife in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands and requested the approval of this programme.\n(9) The Commission has also found that the national control programmes presented by Poland and Spain comply with the criteria laid down in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. Accordingly, Poland and Spain should be included in the list set out in Annex II to Decision 2008/185/EC. That Annex should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Decision 2008/185/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I and II to Decision 2008/185/EC are replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 6 August 2010.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p.\u00a01977/64.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a059, 4.3.2008, p.\u00a019.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0236, 8.9.2007, p.\u00a07.\nANNEX\nANNEX I\nMember States or regions thereof free of Aujeszky\u2019s disease and where vaccination is prohibited\nISO code Member State Regions\nCZ Czech Republic All regions\nDK Denmark All regions\nDE Germany All regions\nFR France The departments of Ain, Aisne, Allier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, Ard\u00e8che, Ardennes, Ari\u00e8ge, Aube, Aude, Aveyron, Bas-Rhin, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Calvados, Cantal, Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cher, Corr\u00e8ze, C\u00f4te-d\u2019Or, C\u00f4tes-d\u2019Armor, Creuse, Deux-S\u00e8vres, Dordogne, Doubs, Dr\u00f4me, Essonne, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Finist\u00e8re, Gard, Gers, Gironde, Hautes-Alpes, Hauts-de-Seine, Haute Garonne, Haute-Loire, Haute-Marne, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Haut-Rhin, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, Haute-Savoie, Haute-Vienne, H\u00e9rault, Indre, Ille-et-Vilaine, Indre-et-Loire, Is\u00e8re, Jura, Landes, Loire, Loire-Atlantique, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Loz\u00e8re, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Marne, Mayenne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Morbihan, Moselle, Ni\u00e8vre, Nord, Oise, Orne, Paris, Pas-de-Calais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, R\u00e9union, Rh\u00f4ne, Sarthe, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Savoie, Seine-et-Marne, Seine-Maritime, Seine-Saint-Denis, Somme, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne, Territoire de Belfort, Val-de-Marne, Val-d\u2019Oise, Var, Vaucluse, Vend\u00e9e, Vienne, Vosges, Yonne, Yvelines\nCY Cyprus All regions\nLU Luxembourg All regions\nNL Netherlands All regions\nAT Austria All regions\nSI Slovenia All regions\nSK Slovakia All regions\nFI Finland All regions\nSE Sweden All regions\nUK United Kingdom All regions in England, Scotland and Wales\nANNEX II\nMember States or regions thereof where approved national control programmes for the eradication of Aujeszky\u2019s disease are in place\nISO code Member State Regions\nBE Belgium All regions\nIE Ireland All regions\nES Spain All regions\nIT Italy The province of Bolzano\nHU Hungary All regions\nPL Poland All regions\nUK United Kingdom All regions in Northern Ireland"}
