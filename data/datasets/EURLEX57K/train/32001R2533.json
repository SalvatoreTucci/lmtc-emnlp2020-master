For the sake of harmonisation, it is essential that imports under the quotas of 'baby beef' originating in Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should also be made subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex III to the interim agreements with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and with Croatia. It is also necessary to establish a model for the authenticity certificates and lay down detailed rules for their use.\n(4) The quotas in question should be managed through the use of import licences. To this end, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(8), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(9), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 24/2001(11), are applicable subject to the provisions of this Regulation.\n(5) In order to ensure proper management of the imports of the products in question, provision should be made for import licences to be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.
