However, the predictive capacity of these variables has proven to be limited, and since these variables have failed to demonstrate stable leading properties across all Member States, the European Statistical System Committee has agreed that the data collection of the industrial new orders variables should be stopped in the context of prioritisation in the development and production of statistics in the light of reduced resources and with the objective of reducing the burden on the European Statistical System.\n(6) In order to implement the removal of the industrial new orders variables, it is necessary to remove all references made to these variables in connexion with the list of variables, the reference period, the level of detail, the deadline for data transmission, the transition period and the definitions to be applied to these variables, and also in relation to the terms of the European sample scheme concerning non-domestic new orders.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1503/2006 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.", "In Regulation (EC) No 657/2007 Articles 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 1\nEuropean sample schemes may be applied when compiling statistics that distinguish between the euro area and non-euro-area for the following two variables specified in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1165/98:\nVariable Name\n312 Output prices of the non-domestic market\n340 Import prices", "Member States participating in the European sample scheme referred to in Article 1 shall transmit data to the Commission (Eurostat) at least for the NACE activities, for variable No 312, and CPA products, for variable No 340, specified in the Annex.\u2019.", "Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0162, 5.6.1998, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0281, 12.10.2006, p.\u00a015.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0155, 15.6.2007, p.\u00a07.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0319, 29.11.2008, p.\u00a016.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0393, 30.12.2006, p.\u00a01.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0145, 4.6.2008, p.\u00a065.\nANNEX I\nAnnex A to Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 is amended as follows:\n(1) point (c) (List of variables) is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 1, the variables \u2018130 New orders received\u2019, \u2018131 Domestic new orders\u2018 and \u2018132 Non-domestic new orders\u2019 are deleted;\n(b) paragraphs 3 and 8 are deleted;\n(2) in point (e) (Reference period), variables 130, 131 and 132 and their respective reference periods are deleted;\n(3) point (f) (Level of detail) is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.

For the distinction into the euro-zone and non-euro-zone, the Commission may determine the terms for applying European sample schemes as defined in point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 4(2). Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 18(3). The European sample scheme may limit the scope of the import price variable to the import of products from non-euro-zone countries.
