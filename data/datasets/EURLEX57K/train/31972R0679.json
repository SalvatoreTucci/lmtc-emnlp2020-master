MANSHOLT\nANNEX I  DETERMINATION OF COEFFICIENT OF WATER ABSORPTION\nObject and Definition\nThe object of the test is to determine the coefficient of water absorption of the ceramic material. This coefficient represents a percentage calculated in relation to the initial weight of the ceramic material.\nPreparation of test pieces and carrying out of tests\nThere should be a minimum of three test pieces for each item to be tested. They should be taken from the enamelled parts of the same article and must not have more than one enamelled surface.\nThe surface area of the test piece should be about 30 square centimetres and its maximum thickness about 8 millimetres, including the enamel.\nDry the test pieces in a kiln of 105 \u00baC for 3 hours and, after cooling in a dryer, determine their weight (Wd) to the nearest 0 705 grammes. Then immediately immerse the test pieces in distilled water in such a way that they do not touch the bottom of the container.\nBoil in water for 2 hours, and then leave the test pieces in the water for 20 hours. Remove them and wipe off the surface water with a clean and slightly damp cloth. Dry any cavities and holes with a slightly damp thin brush. Ascertain the \"wet\" weight Ww. The coefficient of water absorption of the test pieces is obtained by multiplying the increase in weight by 100 and dividing by the dry weight: >PIC FILE= \"T0019203\">\nEvaluation of Results\nThe average of the coefficients of water absorption of the different test pieces, expressed as a percentage, is the water absorption coefficient of the ceramic material.\nANNEX II  TRANSLUCENCY TEST\nDefinition\nThe outline of an object must be visible through a test piece between 2 and 4 millimetres thick placed in a dark room 50 centimetres from a new lamp enclosed in a box and emitting a beam of light of between 1350 and 1500 lumens. The lamp must be changed after 50 hours' use.\nTesting Apparatus  (see sketch annexed)\nThe apparatus consists of a box painted internally in white mat finish. At one of the ends is placed the lamp (A). A hole is made at the opposite end so that the outline of the object (B) may be seen through the test piece (C).\nThe dimensions of the box are as follows:    - length : length of the lamp, plus 50 centimetres\n- width and height : approximately 20 centimetres\nThe diameter of the hole is approximately 10 centimetres.\n>PIC FILE= \"T0019204\">"}
