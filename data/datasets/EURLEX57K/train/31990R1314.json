whereas the objectives of the common  agricultural policy are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural  community, to ensure that supplies are available and that they reach consumers at reasonable  prices;\nWhereas the target price referred to above must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down  in Articles 4 and 6 of Regulation N\u00b0 136/66/EEC;\nWhereas, if the producer is to receive a fair income, production aid must be fixed in the light of  the impact which the consumption aid has on part only of the production;\nWhereas the intervention price must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 8  of Regulation N\u00b0 136/66/EEC;\nWhereas, as a result of the application of Articles 68 and 236 of the Act of Accession, the  intervention price for olive oil in Spain and Portugal differs from the common prices; whereas,\nafter the adjustment of the 'acquis communautaire` with relation to vegetable oils and fats, the  detailed rules for the alignment of intervention prices for olive oil applicable in Spain and  Portugal are those set out in the second indents of Articles 92 (2) and of Article 290 (2) of the  Act of Accession;\nWhereas Articles 95 and 293 of the Act of Accession provide for the granting of Community aid for  the production of olive oil in Spain and in Portugal; whereas, pursuant to Articles 79 and 246 of  that Act, the amounts of the Community aid in Spain and Portugal should be aligned on the common  aid at the beginning of the marketing year; whereas the rules on this alignment result in the  Spanish and Portuguese aid rates shown below;\nWhereas the production target price and the intervention price are fixed for a specific standard  quality; whereas the reasons which led to the determination of the standard quality for the 1981/82  marketing year are still valid; whereas that standard quality should therefore remain unchanged;\nWhereas, under Article 5 (4) of Regulation N\u00b0 136/66/\nEEC, a percentage of the production earmarked  for producers may be allocated to the financing of regional measures to improve the quality of  olive oil production; whereas such measures are necessary in certain production regions; whereas  some of the said aid should therefore be allocated to the financing of such measures;\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 20 (d) (1) of Regulation N\u00b0 136/66/EEC, the percentage of the  production aid which may be withheld for recognized organizations of olive oil producers or  associations thereof should be so fixed that the resulting amount helps to finance the expenditure  incurred in the work done pursuant to Articles 5 (3) and 20c of that Regulation; whereas that  percentage should be set at a level which enables foreseeable expenditure in the 1990/91 marketing  year to be covered,", "main_body": ["For the 1990/91 marketing year, the  production target price, the production aid and the intervention price for olive oil shall be as  follows:\n(a)  production target price: ECU 322,56 per 100 kg;\n(b)  production aid:\n- for Spain:ECU 39,63 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 35,48 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community\nof Ten:ECU 70,95 per 100 kg;\n(c)  production aid for growers whose average production is less than 400 kilograms of olive oil  per year:\n- for Spain:ECU 44,38 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 40,23 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community\nof Ten:ECU 81,76 per 100 kg;\n(d)  intervention price:\n- for Spain:ECU 175,42 per 100 kg,\n- for Portugal:ECU 207,94 per 100 kg,\n- for the Community\nof Ten:ECU 216,24 per 100 kg.", "The prices referred to in Article 1  shall relate to ordinary virgin olive oil with a free fatty acid content, expressed as oleic acid,  of 3,3 grams per 100 grams.", "For the 1990/91 marketing year, 2 % of the production aid earmarked for olive oil  producers shall be allocated to the financing of specific measures to improve the quality of olive  oil in each producer Member State.", "For the 1990/91 marketing year, the percentage of the  production aid which may be withheld pursuant to Article 20d (1) of Regulation N\u00b0 136/66/EEC for  organizations of olive oil producers or associations thereof recognized under the said Regulation  shall be 1,5 %.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that  of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 November 1990.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 May 1990.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nD.
