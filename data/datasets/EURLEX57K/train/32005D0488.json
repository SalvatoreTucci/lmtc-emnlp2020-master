Member States are required to transmit data to the Commission (Eurostat) quarterly following a step-by-step approach.\n(2) However, under Article 6(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 501/2004, the Commission is empowered to grant to Member States one or more derogations from the timetable set by the Regulation for the submission of quarterly data. Those derogations are granted for different purposes and are subject to different conditions.\n(3) In accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 501/2004, a number of Member States' authorities have asked, by letter, to be granted derogations to enable them to bring their national statistical systems into conformity with the Regulation\u2019s requirements.\n(4) According to the information provided to Eurostat, the Member States' requests for derogations are due to the need for major adaptations to national statistical systems in order to comply fully with Regulation (EC) No 501/2004.
