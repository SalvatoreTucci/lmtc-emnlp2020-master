Only the wording inside the symbols makes it possible to distinguish between them.\n(4) In the light of experience gained since they were adopted and with the aim of promoting their use, it should be made easier for consumers to distinguish between protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications. Different colours should therefore be used for the symbols relating to the two different indications.\n(5) In order to ensure that changing the colours of the Community symbols does not cause the producers and traders concerned to suffer economic loss, there should be a transitional period during which it will be possible to use Community symbols complying with the provisions applicable prior to the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nHowever, the packaging or labels including the Community symbols used in accordance with Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006, as applicable prior to the entry into force of this Regulation, may be used until 1 May 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 July 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
