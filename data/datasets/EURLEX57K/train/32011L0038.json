Therefore, platelet units that do not meet these minimum or maximum values have to be discarded.\n(2) Recent scientific evidence and field practice experience has demonstrated that values higher than pH 7,4 do not affect the quality and safety of stored platelets, contrary to pH levels below 6,4 that systematically result in damaging the platelets, and that a maximum pH value for platelet concentrates is thus not necessary.\n(3) Discarding platelets that exceed the maximum pH value as set out in Annex V to Directive 2004/33/EC leads to considerable losses. These losses may increase in the future due to new collection methods and storage bags, which both generate higher pH values at the end of the shelf life.\n(4) Therefore the maximum (7,4) pH value for all platelet concentrates listed in Annex V to Directive 2004/33/EC should be removed.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 28 of Directive 2002/98/EC,", "main_body": ["Annex V to Directive 2004/33/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2011 at the latest.
