whereas Article 14a (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 provides that, if the refund on sugar incorporated into the products listed in Article 1 (1) is insufficient to allow export of the products, the refund fixed in accordance with Article 14 is to be applicable to those products;\nWhereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 states that refunds must be fixed with regard to the existing situation and outlook for prices for products processed from fruit and vegetables on the Community market and supply availability, on the one hand, and prices in international trade on the other hand;

whereas international trade prices are to be determined account taken of the prices indicated in the second subparagraph of that paragraph;\nWhereas the international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on a given product depending on the destination of that product;\nWhereas economically significant exports can be made at the present time of provisionally preserved cherries, peeled tomatoes, preserved cherries, prepared hazelnuts and orange juice;\nWhereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/93 (5) prohibits trade between the European Economic Community and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro);
