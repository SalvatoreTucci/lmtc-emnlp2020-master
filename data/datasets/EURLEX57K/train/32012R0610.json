Therefore, it is necessary to amend the provisions as regards lasalocid sodium.\n(4) New technical information, namely specific studies on transfer ratio of maduramicin from feed into eggs from laying hens has become available. These studies demonstrate that feed for laying hens containing maduramicin due to cross-contamination but below the maximum level results in levels of maduramicin in eggs higher than the currently allowed maximum level. In accordance with the conclusions of the EFSA opinion on cross-contamination of non-target feedingstuffs by maduramicin\u00a0(6) and the scientific opinion on safety and efficacy of maduramicin ammonium for chickens for fattening\u00a0(7), these higher levels do not result in an appreciable risk to consumers\u2019 health. Therefore it is appropriate to amend the provisions as regards maduramicin accordingly.\n(5) The conditions of authorisation of nicarbazin and diclazuril as feed additives have been modified by Commission Regulation (EU) No 875/2010 of 5 October 2010 concerning the authorisation for 10 years of an additive in feedingstuffs\u00a0(8) and Commission Regulation (EU) No 169/2011 of 23 February 2011 concerning the authorisation of diclazuril as a feed additive for guinea fowls\u00a0(9) respectively. Those developments require significant changes to the maximum levels set for nicarbazin and minor changes for diclazuril in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 124/2009. In accordance with the conclusions of the EFSA opinion on cross-contamination of non-target feedingstuffs by nicarbazin\u00a0(10) and the scientific opinion on safety and efficacy of nicarbazin for chickens for fattening\u00a0(11), the proposed maximum levels for nicarbazin in food as a consequence of unavoidable carry-over in non-target feed do not result in an appreciable risk to consumers\u2019 health. Therefore it is appropriate to amend the provisions as regards diclazuril and nicarbazin.\n(6) Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 124/2009 should be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 124/2009 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 37, 13.2.1993, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 40, 11.2.2009, p. 7.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 2.2.2012, p. 6.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain on a request from the European Commission on cross-contamination of non-target feedingstuffs by maduramicin authorised for use as a feed additive, The EFSA Journal (2008) 594, 1-30, Available online: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/594.pdf\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP); Scientific Opinion on safety and efficacy of Cygro\u00ae 10G (maduramicin ammonium \u03b1) for chickens for fattening.
