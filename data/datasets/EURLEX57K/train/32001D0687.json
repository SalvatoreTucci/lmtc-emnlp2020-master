Testing shall be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements expressed in standard EN ISO 17025. Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application. Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications.\nThese criteria aim in particular at promoting:\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption,\n- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the exchangeability of components, and the recyclability and maintainability of the product,\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances.\nThe criteria encourage the implementation of best practice (optimal environmental use) and enhance consumers' environmental awareness. Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages the recycling of the product.\nThe criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of portable computers that have a lower environmental impact.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)\nECOLOGICAL CRITERIA\n1. Energy savings\nThe portable computer shall support the ACPI(1) S3 sleep state (suspend to RAM) to allow minimum energy consumptions below 5 watts. The computer shall be able to wake up from this mode in response to a command from any of the following:\n- modem,\n- network connection,\n- keyboard or mouse action.\nThe default mode-change time from operation to the ACPI S3 sleep state shall be &lt;= 15 minutes of inactivity. The manufacturer must enable this feature.\nThe portable computer shall have a maximum off-mode consumption of &lt;  2 watts when the battery is fully charged and the power supply is connected to the electricity supply. In this context, the off-mode is the state initiated through the command to shut down the computer.\nThe power supply of the portable computer shall have a maximum &lt;  1 watt when it is connected to the electricity supply but is not connected to the computer.\nThe applicant shall provide a report certifying that the level of power consumption in both the ACPI S3 mode and the off-mode have been measured using the procedure in the current Energy Star(2) computer memorandum of understanding. The report shall state the measured power consumptions in both of these modes.\n2. Lifetime extension\nThe manufacturer shall offer a commercial guarantee to ensure that the portable computer will function for at least three years. This guarantee shall be valid from the date of delivery to the customer. The availability of compatible batteries and power supplies and of the keyboard and its parts shall be guaranteed for three years from the time that production ceases.\nIn addition the portable computer shall meet the following criteria:\n- the computer shall be designed so that the memory can be changed,\n- the computer shall be designed so that the hard disk, and if available either the CD drive or DVD drive, can be changed,\n- a minimum of one socket to allow direct connection of equipment such as scanners and back-up devices must be provided.\nThe applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n3.
