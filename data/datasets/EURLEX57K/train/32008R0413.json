Operators should thus be permitted to submit more than one licence application per quota period and there should therefore be a derogation from Article\u00a06(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01301/2006\u00a0(3).\n(3) To ensure that the quotas are managed on the basis of the quota year in question, it should be specified that if licence applications are lodged in December and these applications relate to the following year\u2019s quota, Member States are not to forward such applications to the Commission until the first period of the following year.\n(4) In order to rationalise and simplify the Commission\u2019s procedure for following up applications and to reduce the number of communications to be sent by Member States to the Commission, the number of communications to the Commission should be limited to one per week.\n(5) When Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a02449/96 of 18\u00a0December 1996 opening and providing for the administration of certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714\u00a010\u00a091, 0714\u00a010\u00a099, 0714\u00a090\u00a011 and 0714\u00a090\u00a019 originating in certain third countries other than Thailand\u00a0(4) was codified, by means of Regulation (EC) No\u00a027/2008, the CN code 0714\u00a010\u00a099 was reproduced without taking account of the amended numbering of the Combined Nomenclature codes introduced by Commission Regulation (EC) No\u00a01214/2007\u00a0(5), which replaced CN code 0714\u00a010\u00a099 by CN code ex\u00a00714\u00a010\u00a098. The Regulation should therefore be amended and its title corrected.\n(6) The allocation of quantities reserved for WTO member countries and WTO non-member countries (1\u00a0320\u00a0590 tonnes and 32\u00a0000 tonnes respectively) is unclear in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a027/2008. To avoid confusion, the wording of that provision should be amended.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 27/2008 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 27/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
