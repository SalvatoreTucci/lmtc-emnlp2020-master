In particular according to that Regulation, BEREC is to replace the ERG and act as an exclusive forum for cooperation among NRAs and between the NRAs and the Commission, in the exercise of the full range of their responsibilities under the EU regulatory framework.\n(5) Decision 2002/627/EC should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["Decision 2002/627/EC is hereby repealed as from 1 June 2010."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 May 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a033.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a07.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a021.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0108, 24.4.2002, p.\u00a051.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0200, 30.7.2002, p.\u00a038.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 18.12.2009, p.\u00a037.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 18.12.2009, p.\u00a011.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0337, 18.12.2009, p.\u00a01."}
