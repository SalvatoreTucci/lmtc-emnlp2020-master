Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\n(5) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) By a letter of 12 March 2012 to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.\n(8) The investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would be against the Union interest. Therefore the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. Comments were received from one interested party. However, these comments did not alter the finding that the termination of the proceeding would not be against the Union interest.\n(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain woven and/or stitched glass fibre fabrics originating in the PRC should be terminated,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of fabrics of woven or stitched or woven and stitched continuous filament glass fibre rovings, excluding products which are impregnated or pre-impregnated (pre-preg), and excluding open mesh fabrics with cells with a size of more than 1,8\u00a0mm both in length and in width and weighing more than 35\u00a0g/m2 originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a07019\u00a039\u00a000, ex\u00a07019\u00a040\u00a000 and ex\u00a07019\u00a090\u00a000, is hereby terminated.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 21 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0343, 22.12.2009, p.\u00a051.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ C\u00a0222, 28.7.2011, p.\u00a012."}
