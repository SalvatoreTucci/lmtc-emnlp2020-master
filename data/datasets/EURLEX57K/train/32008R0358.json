Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 of 4 April 2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security\u00a0(2) was the first act laying down such measures.\n(2) The measures provided for by Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 should be reviewed in light of technical developments, operational implications at airports and the impact on passengers. Further research has shown that the benefits of a rulemaking on cabin bag size would not outweigh the operational implications at airports and impact on passengers. This rule, which would apply as from 6 May 2008, should thus be deleted.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 should be amended accordingly.\n(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 5 May 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 April 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJacques BARROT\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p. 1.
