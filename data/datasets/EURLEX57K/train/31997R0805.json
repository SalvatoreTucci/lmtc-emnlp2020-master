Without prejudice to Article 4:\n(a) Member States may grant compensatory aid only by means of payments to beneficiaries and without conditions relating to its use, and\n(b) compensatory aid may be granted only to agricultural holdings, the definition of an agricultural holding being established by the Member State concerned on the basis of objective criteria.\nThe supplementary amounts of compensatory aid shall be granted on the basis of the aid concerned, as referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and allocated for the twelve-month period preceding the respective application of the reduced agricultural conversion rate.\n2. The maximum level of the principal amount of compensatory aid shall be converted into national currency using the agricultural conversion rate valid immediately before the revaluation concerned. The maximum level of any supplementary amount of compensatory aid shall be converted using the agricultural conversion rate concerned valid immediately before the reduction which gave rise to that supplementary amount.\n3. The payment of an annual tranche of compensatory aid shall be made after the observation period referred to in Article 4 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 724/97 and after the beginning of the first month of the tranche concerned. Furthermore, payment of any supplementary amount of compensatory aid shall be made after the date of and in proportion to the actual reduction in the amounts referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 which are concerned.\nPayment to the same beneficiary of the principal amount or of one of the supplementary amounts of a compensatory aid tranche may not be made during the same budget year as payment of the corresponding amount of another tranche.", "1. The principal amount of compensatory aid granted to the beneficiary shall be linked to the size of the holding during a period to be stipulated in each case, according to the criteria laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 724/97.\nIn determining the size of the holding, account shall be taken only of the types of production referred to in Article 6 (1) (a) of the said Regulation.\nMember States may set minimum holding sizes only to the extent necessary to facilitate administration of the compensatory aid.\n2. The total amount of compensatory aid that may be granted for a production sector may not exceed, at macro-economic level, that proportion of the total loss which affects the sector in question in the Member State concerned.\nIn all cases, the compensatory aid must be in conformity with the international commitments of the Community.", "Where the principal amount of compensatory aid which is to be granted for any annual tranche divided by the estimated number of agricultural holdings concerned is below ECU 400, that amount may be granted for all beneficiaries and for the tranche concerned for measures concerning the agricultural sector:\n- which are of collective and of general interest, and/or\n- where Community provisions allow Member States to grant national aid, provided the intensities under the State aid policy are respected.\nThe implementation of the measures in question may not exceed the duration of the three annual tranches and shall be completed within the following six months.\nTo be eligible for Community finance the measures shall be additional either by their nature and/or in terms of aid intensity, to those which the Member State would have applied in the absence of the aid, and shall not benefit from other Community financing.", "1.
