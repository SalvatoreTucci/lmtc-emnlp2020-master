whereas production of mixtures of ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate fell from 435 000 tonnes to 378 000 tonnes over the same period; whereas these products' share of the domestic market fell from 83 % to 54 % in the case of urea and from 79 % to 62 % in the case of mixtures of ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate;\nWhereas the prices of the imports concerned are considerably lower than those of similar products manufactured in Ireland;\nWhereas Community imports of urea originating in the State-trading countries increased from 120 000 tonnes in 1984 to 530 239 tonnes in 1986;\nWhereas, in view of the above, and in particular the trend of imports into Ireland and the rest of the Community of the products concerned and the very low prices of those imports, there is a danger of unpredictable and substantial deflections of trade which are liable to give rise to economic difficulties;\nWhereas, under these conditions, foreseeable intra-Community imports should be monitored closely so that any dangerous trend may be detected and, where appropriate, all necessary measures taken; whereas imports of the products concerned originating in the third countries concerned should therefore be subject to prior intra-Community surveillance in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC;", "main_body": ["Ireland is hereby authorized to apply intra-Community surveillance in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC until 31 December 1987 to imports of the products specified in the Annex hereto originating in Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the USSR and put into free circulation in another Member State.", "This Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 May 1987.\nFor the Commission\nWilly DE CLERCQ\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L No 16, 22. 1. 1980, p. 14.\n(2) OJ L No 346, 8. 12. 1983, p. 6.\nANNEX\n1.2.3 //  //  //  // CCT heading No  // NIMEXE Code  // Description  //  //  //  // ex 31.02   // 31.02-15, 80  // Urea   //   // 31.02-30   // Mixture of ammonium nitrate and calcium cabonate   //    //   //"}
