Therefore, the application of the general measures adopted pursuant to Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 should be deferred until the adoption of implementing rules pursuant to Article 4(3), but not later than 29 April 2010.\n(6) Methods, including technologies, for detection of liquid explosives should be deployed on an EU-wide basis at airports as swiftly as possible and no later than 29 April 2010, thus allowing passengers to carry harmless liquids without restrictions. If it is not possible to deploy methods, including technologies, for the detection of liquid explosives on an EU-wide basis in time, the Commission will propose the necessary addition to the categories of items that may be prohibited (Part B of the Annex). If the deployment of methods, including technologies, is not possible at certain airports for objective reasons, modalities to allow liquids to be carried without compromising standards of security will be specified by the Commission in implementing measures.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security,", "main_body": ["This Regulation provides for general measures to supplement the common basic standards set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 in order to:\n(a) allow methods of screening as laid down in part A of the Annex;\n(b) prohibit categories of articles as laid down in part B of the Annex;\n(c) provide grounds for granting access to airside and security restricted areas as laid down in part C of the Annex;\n(d) allow methods for the examination of vehicles, aircraft security checks and aircraft security searches as laid down in part D of the Annex;\n(e) establish criteria for recognising the equivalence of security standards of third countries as laid down in part E of the Annex;\n(f) set the conditions under which cargo and mail shall be screened or subjected to other security controls and determine the process for the approval or designation of regulated agents, known consignors and account consignors as laid down in part F of the Annex;\n(g) set the conditions under which air carrier mail and air carrier materials shall be screened or subjected to other security controls as laid down in part G of the Annex;\n(h) set the conditions under which in-flight supplies and airport supplies shall be screened or subjected to other security controls and determine the process for the approval or designation of regulated suppliers and known suppliers as laid down in part H of the Annex;\n(i) establish criteria for defining critical parts of security restricted areas as laid down in part I of the Annex;\n(j) establish criteria applicable for the recruitment of persons who will implement, or will be responsible for the implementation of, screening, access control or other security controls and instructors as well as the methods of training of those persons and persons who will be issued with an airport identification card or crew identification card as laid down in part J of the Annex; and\n(k) set the conditions under which special security procedures or exemptions from security controls may be applied as laid down in part K of the Annex.", "For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1. \u2018airport supplies\u2019 means all items intended to be sold, used or made available in security restricted areas of airports;\n2. \u2018in-flight supplies\u2019 means all items other than:\n(a) cabin baggage;\n(b) items carried by persons other than passengers; and\n(c) air carrier mail and air carrier materials;\n3. \u2018regulated supplier of in-flight supplies\u2019 means a supplier whose procedures meet common security rules and standards sufficient to allow delivery of in-flight supplies directly to aircraft;\n4. \u2018known supplier of in-flight supplies\u2019 means a supplier whose procedures meet common security rules and standards sufficient to allow delivery of in-flight supplies to an air carrier or regulated supplier, but not directly to aircraft;\n5. \u2018known supplier of airport supplies\u2019 means a supplier whose procedures meet common security rules and standards sufficient to allow delivery of airport supplies to security restricted areas.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply as from the date specified in the implementing rules adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008, but not later than 29 April 2010.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 April 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAntonio TAJANI\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 97, 9.4.2008, p. 72.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p. 1.\nANNEX\nPART A.\nMethods of screening allowed\nThe implementing rules to be adopted pursuant to Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 may allow the use of the following methods of screening, individually or in combination, as a primary or secondary means and under defined conditions:\n1.
