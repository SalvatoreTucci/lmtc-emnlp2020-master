Economic operators who fulfil the conditions for obtaining the full AEO or AEO Security and safety status should be considered as reliable partners in the supply chain and therefore benefit from facilitations with regard to customs controls relating to security and safety.\n(2) The Union recognises the trade partnership programmes of certain third countries that have been developed in accordance with the World Customs Organization Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade. Consequently, the Union grants facilitations to those economic operators of a third country who hold a membership status under the customs authority\u2019s programme of that third country. It is therefore necessary to introduce means to identify in entry summary declarations the economic operators holding a membership status under trade partnership programmes of third countries. The relevant facilitations will not be provided without proper identification of those economic operators in the entry summary declarations.\n(3) It is therefore appropriate to adapt Annex 30a to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93\u00a0(3) in order to allow indication of economic operators\u2019 third country unique identification number.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 31 January 2013.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 January 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 360, 19.12.2006, p. 64.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\nANNEX\nIn Annex 30a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, in Section 4, \u2018Data elements explanatory notes\u2019, the third paragraph of the data element explanatory note \u2018Consignor\u2019\u2018Entry summary declarations\u2019 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Entry summary declarations:\nThis information takes the form of the consignor EORI number whenever this number is available to the person lodging the summary declaration.\nWhere facilitations are granted in the framework of a third country traders\u2019 partnership programme which is recognised by the Union, this information may take the form of a third country unique identification number which has been made available to the Union by the third country concerned.
