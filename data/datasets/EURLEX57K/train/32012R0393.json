Due to outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2004, imports into the Union of meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds and eggs were prohibited as indicated by the entries in columns 6 and 6A of the table in Part 1 of Annex I to that Regulation.\n(3) In addition, Commission Decision 2005/692/EC of 6 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in several third countries\u00a0(3) provides that Member States are to suspend the importation from Thailand of certain products including meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds, and eggs.\n(4) The animal health situation in Thailand has since improved, in particular as regards the control of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry. Commission experts have carried out several inspection missions in Thailand to assess the animal health situation and the disease control systems in place in that third country. The conclusion drawn from the last mission carried out in Thailand is that the overall system gives sufficient guarantees that the concerned products fulfil the relevant Union requirements.\n(5) In light of this, Decision 2005/692/EC as amended by Commission Implementing Decision 2012/248/EU of 7 May 2012 amending Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/734/EC, 2007/25/EC and 2009/494/EC as regards avian influenza\u00a0(4) no longer suspends imports from Thailand into the Union of the products covered by Decision 2005/692/EC including meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds, and eggs.\n(6) As a result, the entry for Thailand in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should be amended in order to reflect that imports of meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds and eggs into, and transit through, the Union from Thailand are no longer prohibited.\n(7) However, the imports of eggs from Thailand should be subject to the submission by that third country of a Salmonella control programme.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a018, 23.1.2003, p.\u00a011.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0226, 23.8.2008, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0263, 8.10.2005, p.\u00a020.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0See page 42 of this Official Journal.\nANNEX\nIn Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, the entry for Thailand is replaced by the following:\n\u2018TH-Thailand TH-0 Whole country SPF, EP\nWGM VIII   1.7.2012\nPOU, RAT    1.7.2012\nE    1.7.2012   S4\u2019"}
