This interest rate corresponds to the average of the three-month and 12-month forward Euribor rates, recorded in the six months preceding the notification from the Member States provided for in the first paragraph of point I.2 of the aforementioned Annex IV, with a weighting of one third and two thirds respectively. That rate must be fixed at the beginning of each accounting year of the EAGF.\n(3) However, if the interest rate notified by a Member State is lower than the uniform interest rate fixed for the Union, in accordance with the second paragraph of point I.2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006, the interest rate is to be fixed at the level of the rate notified.\n(4) Furthermore, in accordance with the third paragraph of point I.2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006, in the absence of any notification from a Member State, in the form and by the deadline referred to in the first paragraph of point I.2 of the aforementioned Annex IV, the interest rate borne by that Member State is to be considered as being 0\u00a0%. Where a Member State declares that it did not bear any interest costs because it did not have agricultural products in public storage during the reference period, the uniform interest rate fixed by the Commission applies to that Member State. Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia have declared that they did not bear any interest costs as they did not have any agricultural products in public storage during the reference period.\n(5) Given the Member States\u2019 notifications to the Commission, the interest rates applicable for the 2013 EAGF accounting year should be fixed taking the various factors into account.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,", "main_body": ["For expenditure relating to the financial costs incurred by Member States in mobilising funds to buy in products chargeable to the 2013 accounting year of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the interest rates provided for in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 in accordance with Article 4(1)(a) of that Regulation shall be fixed at:\n(a) 0,2\u00a0% in the case of the specific interest rate applicable in Finland;\n(b) 0,3\u00a0% in the case of the specific interest rate applicable in Germany;\n(c) 0,5\u00a0% in the case of the specific interest rate applicable in the United Kingdom and in Ireland;\n(d) 0,9\u00a0% in the case of the specific interest rate applicable in Belgium;\n(e) 1,0\u00a0% in the case of the uniform interest rate for the Union applicable to the other Member States.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 October 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 209, 11.8.2005, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 171, 23.6.2006, p. 35."}
