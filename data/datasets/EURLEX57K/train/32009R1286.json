The non-objection period referred to in that Article should be brought in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1735 of 22 December 2006.\n(4) Following the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 3 September 2008 in Joined Cases C-402/05 P and C-415/05 P: Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) of 3 September 2008 \u2014 Yassin Abdullah Kadi, Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union, Commission of the European Communities, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 should be amended to provide for a listing procedure ensuring that the fundamental rights of the defence and in particular the right to be heard are respected.\n(5) The revised procedure should include providing to the listed person, entity, body or group the reasons for listing as transmitted by the UN Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, so as to give the listed person, entity, body or group an opportunity to express his, her or its views on those reasons. The purpose of Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 is to freeze the funds and economic resources of persons, entities, bodies and groups included in the Al Qaida and Taliban list drawn up by the UN. As the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions provide that such freezing has to take place \u2018without delay\u2019, such a measure must, by its very nature, take advantage of a surprise effect.\n(6) While the Commission should endeavour to notify the reasons for listing directly to the person, entity, body or group concerned, such notification may not be possible in some cases due to incomplete contact details or the complete absence thereof. In such cases, a notice should be published in the Official Journal to inform those concerned of the applicable procedures.\n(7) Where observations are submitted, the Commission should review its decision in the light of those observations and in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(4). The review should be carried out following the regulatory procedure, considering the important political responsibilities involved and the sensitive nature of the international efforts in countering terrorism.\n(8) The same procedure should apply as regards persons, entities, bodies and groups listed before 3 September 2008, in order to respect their rights of defence and in particular their right to be heard.\n(9) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\u00a0(5) and notably the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right to property and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(10) This Regulation also fully respects the obligations of Member States under the Charter of the United Nations and the legally binding nature of UN Security Council Resolutions.\n(11) The purpose of Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 is to prevent terrorist crimes, including terrorist financing, in order to maintain international peace and security. In order to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data for identifying natural or legal persons, entities, bodies or groups, whose funds must be frozen in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 should be made publicly known.\n(12) Any processing of personal data of natural persons under this Regulation should observe Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(6) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(7).\n(13) It is appropriate to clarify the meaning of certain words and to align certain parts of Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 with more recent standard wording for Regulations on restrictive measures.\n(14) Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
