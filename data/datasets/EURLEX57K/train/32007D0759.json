Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs\u00a0(3) lays down permitted maximum levels of aflatoxins in foodstuffs. However, in 2005 and 2006 an increasing number of notifications through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food (RASFF) indicated that those maximum levels have been regularly exceeded in peanuts and derived products from Brazil.\n(3) Such contamination constitutes a threat to public health in the Community. It is therefore appropriate to adopt special measures at Community level.\n(4) The Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carried out a mission in Brazil from 25 April to 4 May 2007 in order to assess the control systems in place to prevent aflatoxin contamination levels in peanuts intended for export to the Community\u00a0(4). That mission revealed that the system for control of peanuts exported to the Community is in place but not fully implemented. Therefore the current system does not fully ensure that peanuts exported to the Community comply with the relevant requirements as regards aflatoxin.\n(5) In the interest of public health, the import of peanuts and derived products into the Community from Brazil should be subject to increased frequency of sampling and analysis of aflatoxin levels by the competent authority of the importing Member State, prior to the release of these products onto the market.\n(6) Article 15(5) of the Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\u00a0(5) provides that a list of feed and food of non-animal origin shall be drawn up to be subject to an increased level of official control on the basis of a known or emerging risk. The measures referred to in Article 15(5) of that Regulation will not apply before 2008. For the protection of public health it is appropriate to impose increased frequency of controls as regards aflatoxins in peanuts from Brazil without delay. For the time being, no health certificate issued by the competent authorities of Brazil is required for the import of peanuts and derived products from Brazil.\n(7) Commission Decision 2006/504/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2006/504/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
