This scheme expires on 31 December 2001, unless a new proposal is presented by the Commission.\n(2) Article 299(2) of the Treaty recognises the particular handicaps affecting the structural social and economic situation of the outermost regions, made worse by their remoteness and insularity. This is also the case for the fisheries sector.\n(3) The Commission, in its report to the European Parliament and to the Council of 14 March 2000, undertook to propose, where appropriate, adjustments to be made to the measures in force after carrying out an evaluation of the scheme.\n(4) A detailed evaluation of the impact of the implementation of the special measures adopted for the fisheries sector in the outermost regions is needed in order to submit the report provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1587/98. It is not possible to carry out the evaluation by 1 June 2001, as required under that Article.\n(5) After carrying out the above evaluation, and as part of the debate on the future of the common fisheries policy, the Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation of the measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1587/98 together, if appropriate, with a new proposal.\n(6) The Commission should be able to adjust the quantities set for the various species to take account of changes in marketing conditions and characteristics.\n(7) The scheme should be extended for one year, to ensure the continuity of the legal framework of the scheme to compensate for additional costs,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1587/98 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
