This is the best way to achieve the energy objectives set in the various legislative texts and other measures in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, including in the transport sector.\n(10) The implementation of the Commission's priorities and, in particular, the sustainable development strategy may result in measures being adopted as part of the Community policy in the areas cited entailing Commission action which could be implemented by the agency. Provision should be made for the possibility of assigning additional management and implementation tasks to the agency.\n(11) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of the Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Establishment of the Agency\n1.
