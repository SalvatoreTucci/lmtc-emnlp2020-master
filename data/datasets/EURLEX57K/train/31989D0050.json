Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater' ('FOM-8').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 8 mm diameter containing an infra-red gallium arsenide photodiode (Texas Instruments) and an NPN Planar photodetector (Texas Instruments) and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 mm.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 57,399  0,330 x1  0,441 x2 + 0,193 x3,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase;   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae;   // x2 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs;   // x3 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kg.\nPART 2\nFat-O-Meater (FOM-6)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater' ('FOM-6').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 mm diameter containing a photodiode (Siemens SFH 950-LD 242) and a photodetector (Siemens SFH 960-BD 103) and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 mm.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central unit.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 57,399  0,330 x1  0,441 x2 + 0,193 x3,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase;   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae;   // x2 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs;   // x3 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kg.\nPART 3\nSPC-Sydel (SPC)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'SPC-Sydel' ('SPC').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 8 mm diameter containing an infra-red gallium arsenide photodiode (Texas Instruments) and an NPN Planar photodetector (Texas Instruments) and having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 mm.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a central unit. 3. The lean content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 57,399  0,330 x1  0,441 x2 + 0,193 x3,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase;   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae;   // x2 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs;   // x3 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kg.\nPART 4\nDestron PC-100 (DEST)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Destron PG-100' ('DEST').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 7 mm diameter containing a photodiode (Texas Instruments SL 2018) and a photodetector (Texas Instruments LS 608D) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 mm.\nThe results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the apparatus itself.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 57,399  0,330 x1  0,441 x2 + 0,193 x3,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase;   // x1 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 cm off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae;   // x2 =   // the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last ribs;   // x3 =   // the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kg.\nPART 5\nManual method\n1. In slaughterhouses with an annual throughput of between 800 and 2 000 tonnes, grading of pig carcases may be carried out using what is termed the 'manual method', which consists in taking two measurements off the midline of the split carcase using a ruler.\n2. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\ny = 44,681  0,559 A1 + 0,277 M,\nwhere:\n1.2 // y =   // the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase;   // A1 =   // minimum back fat thickness (including rind), measured at the site of the gluteus medius muscle,  // M =   // the thickness of the lumbar muscle, measured horizontally between the anterior extremity of the gluteus medius muscle and the dorsal surface of the spinal canal."}
