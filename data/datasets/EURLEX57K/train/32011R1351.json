Moreover, a further possible extension of the enlarged tariff concessions is also envisaged in the Agreement, depending on the future economic development of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n(3) Since the Agreement provides for a further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products and fish and fishery products, it is necessary to suspend the application of the tariff quotas and reference quantities laid down in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 for products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, during the application period of the Agreement.\n(4) Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\u00a0(4), was repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007\u00a0(5).\n(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 700/88 of 17 March 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for the import into the Community of certain floricultural products originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\u00a0(6), was repealed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2006\u00a0(7).\n(6) As a result of those repeals Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 providing for non-eligibility for the tariff concessions for fresh cut flowers and flower buds where the price conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 are not observed, has become redundant and should therefore be deleted.\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) Since the Agreement enters into force on 1 January 2012, this Regulation should apply from that date.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is amended as follows:\n(1) the following Article 1a is inserted:\n(2) Article 2 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 December 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 109, 19.4.2001, p. 2.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 10.12.2011, p. 5.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 10.12.2011, p. 2.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 382, 31.12.1987, p 22.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 72, 18.3.1988, p. 16.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 222, 15.8.2006, p. 4.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 328, 10.12.2011, p. 2.\u2019;"}
