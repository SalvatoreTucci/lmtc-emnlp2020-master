Sampling was applied to Polish producers/exporters and individual duties ranging from 4,0 % to 10,6 % were imposed on the companies in the sample, while other co-operating companies not included in the sample received a weighted average duty of 6,3 %. A duty of 10,6 % was imposed on companies which either did not make themselves known or did not co-operate in the investigation. The producers from which undertakings were accepted were exempted from provisional duties with regard to imports of one specific pallet type, the EUR-pallet, which is the only pallet type covered by the undertakings.\nB.
