RYAN\nANNEX I (1) DEFINITIONS, APPLICATION FOR EEC TYPE APPROVAL, MARKINGS, EEC TYPE APPROVAL, SPECIFICATIONS, TESTS, CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION\n(1.)\n2. DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Directive,  (2.1.)\n2.2.  \"Tractor type as regards radio interference suppression\" means tractors which do not differ in such essential respects as:    2.2.1. The shapes and constituent materials of the part of the body forming the engine compartment and the part of the passenger compartment nearest to it.\n2.2.2. The type of engine (whether two- or four-stroke, number and capacity of cylinders, number of carburettors, arrangement of valves, maximum power and corresponding r.p.m.).\n2.2.3 The position or model of the ignition circuit components (coil, distributor, sparking plugs, screening, etc.).\n2.2.4.

The trade description given by the manufacturer.\n4.2. The markings shall be repeated on the radio interference suppression cables at intervals of not more than twelve centimetres.\n4.3. These markings shall be clearly legible and indelible.\n5.TYPE APPROVAL   (5.1.)\n(5.2.)\n5.3. A form conforming to the model in Annex IV shall be attached to the EEC type approval certificate.\n(5.4.)\n(5.5.)\n(5.6.)\n6.SPECIFICATIONS     6.1. General specifications\nThe components of the radio interference suppression equipment shall be so designed, constructed and fitted as to enable the tractor, in normal conditions of use, to comply with the requirements of this Directive.\n6.2. Specifications concerning radio interference     6.2.1. Method of measurement\nThe interfering radiation set up by the tractor type submitted for approval shall be measured by the method described in Annex II.\n6.2.2. Reference limits      6.2.2.1. The radiation limits based on quasi-peak measurements shall be 50 \u00b6V/m in the 40-75 MHz frequency band and 50-120 \u00b6/Vm in the 75-250 MHz frequency band, this limit increasing linearly with frequencies above 75 MHz.\n6.2.2.2. If measurements are made with peak measuring equipment, the readings, expressed in \u00b6/Vm, shall be divided by 10.\n6.2.3. On the tractor type submitted for approval in respect of radio interference suppression, the measured values shall be not less than 20 per cent below the reference limits.\n7. TESTS\nCompliance with the requirements of section 6 above shall be checked in accordance with the method shown in Annex II.\n(8.)\n9. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION   (9.1.)\n9.2.When the conformity of a tractor taken from the series is being verified, production shall be deemed to conform to the requirements of this Directive if the levels measured do not exceed by more than 25 % the limits prescribed in 6.2.2.\n9.3.If at least one of the levels measured on the tractor taken from the series exceeds the limits prescribed in 6.2.2. by more than 25 %, the manufacturer may request that measurements be made on a sample of at least six tractors taken from the series. The results for each frequency band shall be interpreted by the statistical method shown in Annex III.\n(10.)\n(11.)\nANNEX II METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF RADIO INTERFERENCE PRODUCED BY HIGH-VOLTAGE IGNITION SYSTEMS\n1. MEASURING APPARATUS\nThe measuring equipment shall comply with the requirements of Publication No 2 (first edition, 1961) of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) or with the specifications applicable to peak type measuring apparatus given in CISPR Publication No 5 (first edition, 1967).\nNote:\nWhere the available equipment does not fully meet all the CISPR specifications, discrepancies must be clearly stated.\n2. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nThe results of measurements must be expressed in \u00b6V/m for 120 kHz bandwidth. For statistical purposes, the logarithmic unit dB (\u00b6V/m) shall be used. If for certain frequencies the actual bandwidth B (expressed in kHz) of the measuring apparatus differs slightly from 120 kHz, the readings taken should be converted to 120 kHz bandwidth through multiplication >PIC FILE= \"T0006923\">\n3. MEASURING SITE\nThe measuring site shall be a level area free from appreciable wave-reflecting surfaces within an ellipse having a major axis of 20 m and a minor axis of 17 73 m. The antenna and the centre of the engine must be located on the major axis of the ellipse, the plane of symmetry of the tractor being parallel to the minor axis. The antenna and the point of intersection of the side of the engine nearest to the antenna with the major axis must each be located at a focal point of the ellipse. The measuring set, or the test hut or vehicle in which the set is located, may be within the ellipse but horizontally not closer than 3 m to the antenna, in a direction opposite to the tractor being measured. Furthermore, the absence of any extraneous or signal which could materially affect the measurement must be ensured ; a check is therefore made, with the engine stopped, before and after taking the measurements, which can be considered satisfactory only if the readings are at least 10 dB above the highest obtained at the pre- and post-measurement checks.\n4. TRACTOR      4.1. Only the ancillary electrical equipment necessary for the running of the engine shall be operating.\n4.2. The engine shall be at its normal operating temperature. During each measurement, the engine shall be operated as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0006891\">\n4.3. Measurements shall not be made while rain is falling on the vehicle or within 10 minutes after rain has stopped.\n5. ANTENNA      5.1. Height\nThe centre of the dipole shall be 3 m above the ground.\n5.2. Distance of measurement\nThe horizontal distance from the antenna to the nearest metal part of the tractor shall be 10 m.\n5.3. Antenna location relative to tractor\nThe antenna shall be placed successively on the left- and right-hand sides of the tractor at two positions of measurement, with the aerial parallel to the plane of symmetry of the tractor and in line with the engine. (See Appendix to this Annex).\n5.4. Antenna position\nAt each of the measuring points, readings shall be taken with the dipole in a horizontal and in a vertical position. (See Appendix to this Annex).\n5.5.Readings\nThe maximum of four readings shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.\n6.FREQUENCIES\nMeasurements shall be made within the 40 to 250 MHz range. A tractor is considered as very likely to meet the required suppression limits over the whole frequency range if it meets them at the following six frequencies : 45, 65, 90, 150, 180 and 220 (\u00b1 5 MHz) (The 5 MHz tolerance for the six frequencies chosen should make it possible to avoid interference from transmissions operating on the nominal frequencies).\nAppendix\nANTENNA DIRECTION RELATIVE TO TRACTOR Example\n>PIC FILE= \"T0006893\">   Plan\nDipole antenna in position to measure horizontal component of the radiation\n>PIC FILE= \"T0006894\">    Elevation\nDipole antenna in position to measure horizontal component of the radiation\nANNEX III STATISTICAL METHOD OF CHECKING RADIO INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION\nIn order to ensure with an 80 % probability that 80 % of the vehicles conform to a specified limit L, the following condition must be satisfied: >PIC FILE= \"T0006895\">\nIf a first sample of n tractors does not meet the specification, a second sample of n tractors shall be tested and the overall results assessed as coming from a sample of 2n tractors.\nANNEX IV\n>PIC FILE= \"T0006896\">"}
