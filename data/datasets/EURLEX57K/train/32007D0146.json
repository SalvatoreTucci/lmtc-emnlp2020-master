In view of those findings, it is appropriate to amend the demarcation of the restricted zone in Germany.\n(9) On 10 January 2007, Italy presented a report to the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health which concludes that the surveillance system in place in Italy has proved that no seroconversion has occurred in the Region of Marche, since April 2005.\n(10) Consequently, that region should be considered free of bluetongue and, on the basis of the substantiated request submitted by Italy, deleted from the Italian regions listed under Zone B in Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC.\n(11) Decision 2005/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/393/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
