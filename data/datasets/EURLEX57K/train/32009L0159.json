The requested scientific data on the safety of reaction products formed by oxidative hair dye substances were submitted by the cosmetics industry to the SCCS before the agreed deadline of 31 December 2007.\n(3) The submitted safety data were evaluated by the SCCS. In January 2009, the SCCS concluded in its opinion that it is not in the position to finally assess the risk of reaction products of oxidative hair dyes due to the incompleteness of the dossier submitted by the industry. The cosmetics industry provided the missing data by the end of September 2009.\n(4) In view of the above, the risk assessment of the submitted additional data and the final opinion given by the SCCS on the safety of the reaction products will still require a period of time exceeding the provisional deadline of 31 December 2009 for the substances listed in Part 2 of Annex III.\n(5) Therefore, the definitive regulation of 31 hair dye substances listed in Part 2 of Annex III, on the basis of risk assessment of their reaction products, and its implementation into the laws of Member States will not take place before the provisional deadline. Consequently, their provisional use in cosmetic products under the current restrictions and conditions laid down in Part 2 of Annex III should be extended. The new prolonged deadline of 31 December 2010 is considered sufficient for the definitive regulation of these substances.\n(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Directive 76/768/EEC\nIn reference numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 48, 49, 50, 55, and 56 of column g in Part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC, the date \u201831.12.2009\u2019 is replaced by \u201831.12.2010\u2019.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2009 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
