In this case, the producer shall submit to the competent authorities not  later than the day on which lambing begins, a specific notification giving the details described in  the three indents of the first subparagraph. This notification shall be referred to in the premium  application for the marketing year in respect of which this notification was submitted.\nThe competent authorities designated by the Member State shall institute measures to check these  specific notifications. Such measures shall include on-the-spot inspections at the place of lambing  of at least 10 % of those producers submitting notifications in respect of any marketing year.  However, in the case where producers notify that more than 40  % of their ewes lamb outside the  retention period, the competent authorities shall take appropriate measures to ensure that 50  % of  the abovementioned inspections on those producers take place outside the retention period.`;\n3.  the last subparagraph of Article 2 (2) is replaced by the following text:\n'Where the competent authority finds that the information contained in the specific notification or  in the premium application pursuant to paragraph 1 constitutes a false notification made  deliberately or through serious negligence, the producer concerned shall also lose the right to the  premium in accordance with Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 for the marketing year in  respect of which the false notification is found to have been made.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the  Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to applications for premiums presented for the 1996 marketing year and subsequent  years.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 November 1995.\nFor the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission"}
