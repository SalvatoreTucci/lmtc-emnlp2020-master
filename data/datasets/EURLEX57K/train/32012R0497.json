It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for the control of bluetongue and for the prevention of clinical disease in such animals in the Union.\n(4) To ensure better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and to reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, the rules on vaccination laid down in Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue\u00a0(3) were recently amended by Directive 2012/5/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production.\n(5) Accordingly, Directive 2000/75/EC now provides for the use of inactivated vaccines in all parts of the EU.\n(6) As a result of the evolving epidemiological situation as regards bluetongue, and to align with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 of 26 October 2007 on implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue\u00a0(5) was amended recently. The EU standards require the absence of virus circulation for a minimum period of two years in order to consider a territory free from bluetongue. The period of twelve months referred to in the relevant certificates set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Directive 2000/75/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 apply to intra-Union movements of live ungulates of species susceptible to bluetongue. It is appropriate that the models of veterinary certificates BOV-X, BOV-Y, OVI-X, OVI-Y and RUM set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 be amended to align the animal health requirements for imports into the Union, as regards bluetongue, to the requirements for intra-Union movement in animals susceptible to that disease.\n(8) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "For a transitional period until 30 June 2012, consignments of live ungulates accompanied by a certificate issued before the date of entry into force of this Regulation in accordance with the models BOV-X, BOV-Y, OVI-X, OVI-Y or RUM set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 before the amendments introduced by this Regulation may continue to be introduced into the Union.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 June 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 321.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 73, 20.3.2010, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 81, 21.3.2012, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 283, 27.10.2007, p. 37.\nANNEX\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, Part 2 is amended as follows:\n(1) Models \u2018BOV-X\u2019, \u2018BOV-Y\u2019, \u2018OVI-X\u2019 and \u2018OVI-Y\u2019 are replaced by the following:\n(2) The Model \u2027RUM\u2019 is replaced by the following:"}
