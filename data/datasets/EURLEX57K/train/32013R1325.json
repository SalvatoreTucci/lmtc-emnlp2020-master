The suspension should cover all products falling within CN code 2710\u00a019\u00a021. Taking into account possible future changes in the market situation of jet fuel, the suspension should be reviewed on the basis of an assessment within five years.\n(7) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87\u00a0(3) should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the text for CN code 2710\u00a019\u00a021 in column 3 of the table in Chapter 27 of Section V of Part Two, is replaced by the following:\n\u20184,7\u00a0(4)", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2014.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 December 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
