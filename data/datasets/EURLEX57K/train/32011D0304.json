The Commission has published in the Official Journal successive lists of bicycle assemblers\u00a0(5) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.\n(2) Following the last publication of the list of parties under examination\u00a0(6), a main period of examination has been selected. This period was defined as from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2010. Further information from the years 2008 and 2009 were also requested. A questionnaire was sent to all parties which were to be evaluated, requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination.\n(3) The Commission was also informed of the liquidation of two companies which were exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty on bicycle parts. Furthermore, a further company failed to comply with the conditions of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97. For these companies the exemption will be revoked.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\nA.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceptable requests for exemption\n(4) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. These parties had already received their suspension with effect from the day of arrival of a first complete application dossier at the Commission\u2019s premises. The newly requested and provided information was examined and verified, where necessary, at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nSektor S.R.L. Via Don Peruzzi 27/B, 36027 Rosa\u2019 (VI) Italy A956\nSintema Sport S.R.L. Via delle Valli 7, 20042 Albiate (MB) (postal code will change to 20847) Italy A970\nWilier Triestina S.P.A. Via Fratel M. Venzo 11/1, 36028 Rossano Veneto (VI) Italy A963\n(5) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that for all of these applicants\u2019 bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60\u00a0% of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations, and they, therefore, fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.\n(6) For this reason, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, the parties listed in the above table should be exempt from the extended anti-dumping duty.\n(7) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation, the exemption of the parties listed in table 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.\n(8) The company Sintema Sport S.R.L. informed the Commission that the postal code of the company will change in April 2011 from 20042 to 20847 due to the change of district of Albiate from Milan district to Monza district.\nA.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unacceptable requests for exemption\n(9) The parties listed in table 2 below also submitted a request for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBicicletas JL C/Alhama No 64, 14900 Lucena Spain A982\nEddy Merckx Cycles N.V.

One party informed the Commission that they do not need the exemption in the future. Two parties did not submit a questionnaire reply and claimed that they had not used bicycle parts subject to anti-dumping duty in their assembly operation. One party is in liquidation.\n(11) Since the parties listed in table 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption, the Commission has to reject their request for exemption, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the exemption Regulation. In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the request submitted by this party.\nA.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Revocations\n(12) For the parties listed in table 3 below the exemption is to be revoked.\nName Address Country TARIC additional code\nBiria Bike GmbH Hauptstrasse 37, 01904 Neukirch/Lausitz Germany 8062\nMoore Large & Co.

The Commission was informed now that one of these parties has already been liquidated and one party is in liquidation. Evidence available to the Commission has shown that another company stopped its assembly operations and resold the imported parts to a not exempted party. Although those imports fall outside the scope of the exemption scheme, the company continued to declare those imports under it. Due to the fact that it has no own assembly operation, the company does not fulfil its obligations under Article 8 of the exemption Regulation, i.e. it does not ensure that its assembly operation remains outside the scope of Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and no conclusive records can be provided showing the use made of the deliveries received. Consequently, the exemption has to be revoked in accordance with Article 10 of the exemption Regulation.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED\n(14) Interested parties are hereby informed of the receipt of further requests for exemption, pursuant to Article 3 of the exemption Regulation, from parties listed in table 3.

In the meantime the company changed its legal seat from ul. Krolewska nr 16, 00-103 Warszawa to Olszanka 109, 33-386 Podegrodzie. This change of legal seat does not affect the initial request for suspension. The company JET\u2019LEAN received its suspension on 18 February 2010. In the meantime the legal name of JET\u2019LEAN was changed into JETLANE. This change of name does not affect the initial request for suspension. The company M\u00fcller GmbH received its suspension on 30 March 2010. The additional TARIC code A977 initially given to the company M\u00fcller GmbH was erroneously attributed twice and was withdrawn. As of 3 June 2010 the company M\u00fcller GmbH received the additional TARIC code A978. This change of code does not affect the initial request for suspension.\n(16) All companies listed in tables 1 \u2013 4 above were informed and given the opportunity to comment. It was found that contrary to the original information at the Commission\u2019s disposal company IMACycles Bicicletas e Motociclos Lda was not in fact in liquidation. Consequently, the exemption for that company will not be revoked and the name of the company was removed from table 3. None of the other comments received were such as to alter the conclusions set out in this Decision,", "main_body": ["The parties listed below in table 1 are hereby exempt from the extension to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People\u2019s Republic of China by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the definitive anti-dumping duty on bicycles originating in the People\u2019s Republic of China imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93, last amended and maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005.\nThe exemption shall take effect in relation to each party as from the relevant date shown in the column headed \u2018Date of effect\u2019.\nTable 1\nList of parties to be exempt\nName Address Country Exemption pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 88/97 Date of effect TARIC additional code\nSektor S.R.L.
