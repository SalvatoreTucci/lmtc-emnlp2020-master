The indication of the API nominal gravity identifies each type of crude oil.\n2. Lines 1 to 19 inclusive list the particular types of imported crude oils, excluding those in transit to other Member States or destined for non-member countries. The type designations given are the same as those listed in Directive 76/491/EEC. Line 20 \"Other imported crude oils\" covers all crude oil imported from non-member countries not shown in lines 1 to 19 inclusive, and those from one other Member State. Line 24 relates to all crudes listed in the table.\nFor each type of crude listed, two sub-items - (a) and (b) - are each intended to provide information on one of the most representative commercial grades of a crude oil for which there is a price (1). Sub-item (c) - Others - records the information on other grades so that the three sub-items (a), (b) and (c) cover all the details contained in each of the headings of Table 1 of the Directive.\n3.

The fob price is that price actually paid by the undertakings, or that which they expect to pay, after deduction of rebates. Average fob prices are the average monthly quantity-weighted prices applicable at the time of loading. They will be calculated by reference to the most appropriate exchange rates so as to provide the most representative indications of the prices of crude oils. The average monthly dollar exchange rate will be shown at the foot of the table.\n\"Days of free credit\" means the number of days allowed to pay for the oil, i.e. without financial charge.\n(1)>PIC FILE= \"T0014731\">"}
