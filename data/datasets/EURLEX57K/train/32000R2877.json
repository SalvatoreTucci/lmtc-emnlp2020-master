This is so because Member States do change in many cases their share on EU total production from year to year.\n(3) In Annex II to this Regulation, the weighting coefficients used for the determination of prices recorded on the representative markets in the Member States should be adjusted in order to reflect the relative importance of the regional markets and product categories in the calculation of the national average representative price. The reason for that modification is that the importance of individual regional markets and product categories within a Member State may change from year to year.\n(4) In Annex III to this Regulation, the names and definitions of product categories should be updated in line with the changing trends on the regional markets.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1481/86 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
