Given that, in addition, the now considerable volume and value of intra- and extra-Community trade in cultivated mushrooms justify the adoption of a standard, the product should be added to the list of products which are to be supplied fresh to the consumer and are subject to standards.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,", "main_body": ["Cultivated mushrooms are added to the list given in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 10 May 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 100, 11.4.2001, p. 12."}
