The reason for this was that, in the case of maize, it cannot be excluded that sorting methods or other physical treatments reduce the level of contamination of aflatoxins but the real effectiveness of these methods remains to be demonstrated. It was also provided that, in the absence of data justifying the fixing of a specific maximum level for unprocessed cereals, the levels of 2 \u03bcg/kg aflatoxin B1 and 4 \u03bcg/kg aflatoxin total were to apply.\n(3) In that connection, data with regard to maize have been submitted. On the basis of the submitted data, it is evident that through the various sorting and physical treatments the aflatoxin content of unprocessed maize can be significantly reduced after cleaning in the final consumer product (flaking grits, other grits). The aflatoxin contamination was mainly concentrated in the screenings (waste) and in maize germ, bran meal and broken maize (products for animal feed). While it is not possible to assess precisely quantitatively and with certainty to what extent this reduction can be achieved, it is evident from the data available that the different cleaning and processing steps are sufficiently effective in removing aflatoxins from maize products destined for human consumption whereby raw maize containing levels of aflatoxin B1 of 5 \u03bcg/kg and aflatoxin total of 10 \u03bcg/kg will result in maize products destined for human consumption complying with the maximum levels of aflatoxin B1 of 2 \u03bcg/kg and aflatoxin total of 4 \u03bcg/kg, providing a high level consumer protection.\n(4) It appears that some food control enforcers and analysts, when reporting the analytical result, use the same number of significant figures in which the maximum level in legislation is expressed.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.
