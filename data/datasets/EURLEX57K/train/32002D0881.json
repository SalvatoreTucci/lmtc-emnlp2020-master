That procedure has been applied in some cases and the reports issued on the outcome have been considered by the Commission.\n(4) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 provide that refunds on exports to third countries and intervention intended to stabilise agricultural markets may be financed only where they are either granted or undertaken in accordance with the Community rules governing the common organisations of agricultural markets.\n(5) The findings of checks performed, the results of bilateral discussions and the outcome of the conciliation procedures have shown that some expenditure declared by the Member States does not meet those conditions and cannot therefore be financed under the EAGGF Guarantee Section.\n(6) The Annex to this Decision sets out the amounts that are not recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Those amounts do not relate to expenditure incurred more than 24 months before the Commission's written notification of the results of the checks to the Member States.\n(7) As regards the cases covered by this Decision, the assessment of the amounts to be excluded on grounds of non-compliance with Community rules was notified by the Commission to the Member States and is set out in a summary report on the subject.\n(8) This Decision is without prejudice to any financial conclusions that the Commission may draw from the judgments of the Court of Justice in cases pending on 31 May 2002 and relating to its content,", "main_body": ["The expenditure itemised in the Annex hereto that has been incurred by the Member States' accredited paying agencies and declared under the EAGGF Guarantee Section is hereby excluded from Community financing because it does not comply with Community rules.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.\n(2) OJ L 125, 8.6.1995, p. 1.\n(3) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 103.\n(4) OJ L 158, 8.7.1995, p. 6.\n(5) OJ L 274, 17.10.2001, p. 3.\n(6) OJ L 182, 16.7.1994, p. 45.\n(7) OJ L 193, 17.7.2001, p. 25.\nANNEX\nCORRECTION TOTALS\n>TABLE>"}
