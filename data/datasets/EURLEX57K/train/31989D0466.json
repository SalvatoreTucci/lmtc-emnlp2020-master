whereas, in the case of supply or letting with the developer option for taxation under Article 13 (C) (a) of the Sixth Directive, this  objective is achieved because the price of the supply or the rent necessarily reflects the value of the land at the time of such supply or letting;\nWhereas, in order to achieve the objective in question where the building is to be occupied by a taxable person who has constructed it and who is not entitled to full deduction of the tax or where the same taxable person lets the building on an exempt  basis under Article 13 (B) (b) of the Sixth Directive, the United Kingdom intends to make use of the option provided for in Article 5 (7) (a) and (b) of the said Directive to tax such occupation or letting of the property on the basis of its open market  value;\nWhereas, as a result of the taxable amount being determined by reference to the open market value in this way, the amended request derogates from Article 11 (A) (1) (b) of the Sixth Directive, which stipulates that, in respect of supplies referred to in  Article 5 (6) and (7), the taxable amount is the purchase price of the goods or of similar goods or, in the absence of a purchase price, the cost price, determined at the time of supply;\nWhereas it is appropriate to accede to the request of the United Kingdom pending deletion of point 16 of Annex F to the Sixth Directive, which permits Member States to exempt temporarily supplies of new buildings and building land;\nWhereas the said special measure will not have a negative effect on the European Communities' own resources accruing from value added tax,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 11 (A) (1) (b) of the Sixth Directive, the United Kingdom is hereby authorized to use the open market value as the taxable amount for the supply, within the meaning of Article 5 (7) (a) and (b) of the said  Directive, of buildings or parts of buildings before first occupation and of the land on which they stand.", "This authorization shall be granted pending the deletion of point 16 of Annex F to the Sixth Directive.", "This Directive is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 July 1989.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nR.
