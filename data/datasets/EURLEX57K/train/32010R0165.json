The Contam Panel concluded that changing the maximum levels for total aflatoxins from 4 to 8 or 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios would have minor effects on the estimates of dietary exposure, cancer risk and the calculated margins of exposure (MOEs). The Panel furthermore concluded that exposure to aflatoxins from all sources should be as low as reasonably achievable, because aflatoxins are genotoxic and carcinogenic. The data indicate that reduction of total dietary exposure to aflatoxins could be achieved by reducing the number of highly contaminated foods reaching the market through more effective enforcement and reducing exposure from food sources other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios.\n(5) The Contam Panel adopted on 16 June 2009 a statement on the effects on public health of an increase of the levels for aflatoxin total from 4\u00a0\u03bcg/kg to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for tree nuts other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios\u00a0(5). The Panel concluded that based on the information which was available in 2007 public health would not be adversely affected by increasing the levels for total aflatoxins from 4\u00a0\u03bcg/kg to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for other tree nuts, including Brazil nuts. Given the current discussions in Codex Alimentarius on the maximum levels for aflatoxins in Brazil nuts, it is appropriate to align the level for aflatoxins in Brazil nuts with the Codex level for almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios.\n(6) Codex Alimentarius established only a maximum level for aflatoxin total. The corresponding aflatoxin B1 level was determined by making use of the database on occurrence of aflatoxins in food used by EFSA for the exposure assessment.\n(7) In the EFSA opinion on aflatoxins it is observed that oilseeds and derived products are an important contributor to the human aflatoxin exposure. EFSA concluded that exposure to aflatoxins from all sources should be as low as reasonably achievable. Furthermore, notifications in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) indicate high levels of aflatoxins in oilseeds such as sunflower seeds, melon seeds etc. It is therefore proposed to also set a maximum level for oilseeds other than groundnuts (peanuts), in line with the existing maximum levels for groundnuts (peanuts). However, as aflatoxins are nearly completely removed by the process for producing refined vegetable oils, it is appropriate to exclude oilseeds, including groundnuts (peanuts), intended for crushing for refined vegetable oil and refined vegetable oil.\n(8) A maximum level of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 4\u00a0\u03bcg/kg aflatoxin total has been established in all cereals and all products derived from cereals with the exception of maize to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption for which a maximum level of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg for aflatoxin total has been established. Rice in husk regularly contains levels of aflatoxins slightly above the maximum levels. After milling, a process which removes the husk, the levels of aflatoxins in the white milled rice are below the maximum levels. It is therefore appropriate to apply the same approach for rice as the existing approach for maize, and to set a higher maximum level of aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin total for rice to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.\n(9) The maximum levels refer to the edible part of the tree nuts. However, recent scientific evidence has demonstrated that a part of the aflatoxin contamination can be found on the shell of Brazil nuts. Therefore, it is appropriate to modify the footnote in the Annex, indicating the procedure to be followed in case tree nuts \u2018in shell\u2019 are analysed, to take into account this recent scientific information.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.
