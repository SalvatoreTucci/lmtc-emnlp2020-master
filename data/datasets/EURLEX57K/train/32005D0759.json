There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live birds other than poultry, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds).\n(2) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine\u00a0(2) provides that Member States are to authorise the import of birds from the third countries listed as members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The countries listed in the Annex to the present Decision are members of the OIE and accordingly Member States are required to accept imports of birds, other than poultry, from those countries under Decision 2000/666/EC.\n(3) Where necessary, reference should also be made to Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat\u00a0(3).\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC provides for different veterinary control regimes depending on the number of animals. It is appropriate to use those differentiations in number for the sake of this Decision.\n(5) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC\u00a0(4) requires imported animals to undergo the checks in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC.\n(6) In accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 the safeguard measures taken in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC\u00a0(5), and in particular Article 18 (1) thereof, shall apply.\n(7) Highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in imported birds in quarantine in a Member State, it appears therefore appropriate to suspend movement of pet birds from certain areas at risk and to use for the definition of the areas a reference to the relevant Regional Commissions of the OIE.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Movement from third countries\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall only authorise the movement of consignments of less than 5 live pet birds.
