The Court of Justice of the European Communities in its order of 19 January 2005\u00a0(3) has ruled that certain nicotine patches intended to help their users to stop smoking are to be classified as \u2018medicaments\u2019 of heading 3004 of the CN.\n(3) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature in respect of goods and products to assist smokers to stop smoking, it is necessary to add an additional note 2 to Chapter 30 of the CN.\n(4) Products intended to assist smokers to stop smoking, such as tablets, chewing gum or other preparations, do not allow a gradual and continuous release of nicotine throughout the day and cannot be seen as presenting prophylactic and therapeutic characteristics. It is therefore appropriate to provide in the additional note that Chapter 30 on Pharmaceutical products does not cover products, such as tablets, chewing gum or other preparations, intended to assist smokers to stop smoking which fall under heading 2106 or 3824, with the exclusion of nicotine patches.\n(5) Nicotine patches present prophylactic and therapeutic characteristics because of their direct application on the skin allowing a gradual and continuous release of nicotine throughout the day. Given their prophylactic and therapeutic characteristics, nicotine patches are classified in Chapter 30 and therefore have to be excluded from the additional note.\n(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The Customs Code Committee has not issued an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,", "main_body": ["In part Two, Section VI, Chapter 30 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the following Additional note 2 is inserted:\n\u20182.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 11 March 2010.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nAlgirdas \u0160EMETA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0256, 7.9.1987, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0311, 17.11.1988, p.\u00a025.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Order of 19 January 2005, Case C-206/03: Commissioners of Customs & Excise v SmithKline Beecham, ECR [2005] I-415."}
