In the interests of clarity, it is appropriate to replace that Committee by a new European Statistical Advisory Committee (the Committee).\n(4) The Committee should contribute to a close cooperation in the programme-planning process in order to improve the governance of the European Statistical System and enhance the quality of Community statistics. To this effect, close collaboration should be maintained with the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom\u00a0(4) and with the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics established by Council Decision 91/115/EEC\u00a0(5).\n(5) A balance should be achieved between the need to reduce membership in order to enable the Committee to work efficiently in an enlarged Community on the one hand, and the need to allow representation of all stakeholders in Community statistics, as requested in the Council conclusions of 8 November 2005, on the other.\n(6) In order to meet the objectives of better assessing and balancing the benefits and costs of Community statistical requirements and rebalancing and reducing the burden of Community statistical legislation, so facilitating compliance with increasing demand, the Committee should play a stronger role in preparing and implementing the Community statistical programme.\n(7) The Committee should serve as a channel for advice from users, respondents and producers of statistical information on the objectives of the Community\u2019s statistical information policy.\n(8) Decision 91/116/EEC should therefore be repealed,", "main_body": ["European Statistical Advisory Committee\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Statistical Advisory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) is hereby established.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall assist the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission in ensuring that user requirements and the costs borne by information providers and producers are taken into account in coordinating the strategic objectives and priorities of the Community\u2019s statistical information policy.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That assistance shall cover all statistical domains relevant to the Community\u2019s statistical information policy.", "Tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission shall consult the Committee at an early stage in the preparation of the Community statistical programme.
