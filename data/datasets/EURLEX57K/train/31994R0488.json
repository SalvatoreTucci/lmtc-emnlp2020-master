The guarantee thresholds for the 1993 harvest in Greece shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.\n2. Greece may increase the guarantee thresholds laid down in the Annex for variety groups VI, VII and VIII up to the quantities laid down for the 1993 harvest in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2076/92. In that case, the guarantee threshold laid down  for variety group I shall be reduced by a corresponding amount.\nIf Greece avails itself of that option, the resulting expenditure to the EAGGF may not exceed the amount which would have resulted had Regulation (EEC) No 2076/92 been applied.", "1. The threshold quantity for variety group I (flue-cured) which becomes available pursuant to Article 1 shall be allocated to producers who apply therefor, up to the quantities applied for, in proportion to their quotas for variety group I  (flue-cured) for the 1993 harvest.\n2. Greece shall lay down the details which must appear in applications and the date by which they must be lodged.", "The reduction in the guarantee thresholds for variety groups VI (Basmas), VII (Katerini) and VIII (Kaba-Koulak classic) shall be made across the board in the EAGGF financing of premiums.
