The nature of this type of fishery is such that it cannot be undertaken with any other gear.\n(11) The management plan guarantees no future increase in the fishing effort, as fishing authorisations will be issued to specified 23 vessels involving a total effort of 1\u00a0225 Kw that are already authorised to fish by France.\n(12) The request covers vessels with a track record in the fishery of more than five years and which operate under a management plan adopted by France on 15 April 2014\u00a0(2) in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(13) Those vessels are included on a list communicated to the Commission in line with the requirements of Article\u00a013(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(14) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 since the French management plan explicitly prohibits to fish above protected habitats.\n(15) The requirement of Article 8(1)(h) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are not applicable since they relate to trawlers.\n(16) As regards the requirement to comply with Article 9(3) establishing the minimum mesh size, the Commission\u00a0notes that given the fishing activities concerned are highly selective, have a negligible effect on the marine environment and are not carried out above protected habitats, in line with Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01967/2006 France authorised a derogation from these provisions in its management plan.\n(17) The fishing activities concerned fulfil the recording requirements set out in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\u00a0(3).\n(18) The fishing activities concerned do not interfere with the activities of vessels using gears other than trawls, seines or similar towed nets.\n(19) The activity of shore seines is regulated in the French management plan to ensure that catches of species mentioned in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 are minimal.\n(20) Shore seines do not target cephalopods.\n(21) The French management plan includes measures for the monitoring of fishing activities, as provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(22) The requested derogation should therefore be granted.\n(23) France should report to the Commission in due time and in accordance with the monitoring plan provided for in the French management plan.\n(24) Article 15(11) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4) requires that for the species subject to the landing obligation as specified in Article 15(1) of the same Regulation, the use of catches of species below the minimum conservation reference size shall be restricted to purposes other than direct human consumption.\n(25) The French management plan includes a derogation to the minimum size of marine organisms for fries of sardine landed for human consumption and targeted by the fishing activities regulated therein, in accordance with Article\u00a015(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006.\n(26) A limitation in duration of the derogation should be introduced, to reflect the calendar of the entry into force of the landing obligation as defined in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n(27) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 shall not apply in territorial waters of France adjacent to the coast of Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur to shore seines used by vessels:\n(a) bearing the registration number mentioned in the French management plan;\n(b) having a track record in the fishery of more than five years and not involving any future increase in the fishing effort deployed;
