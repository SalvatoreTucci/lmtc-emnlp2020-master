Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) Quinoline Yellow was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for non food-producing animals and for food-producing animals as regards certain processed feedingstuffs as part of the group \u2018Colourants\u2019. This substance was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives established in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003\n(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of Quinoline Yellow as a feed additive for non food-producing animals and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, the applicant requested that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2013 that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, Quinoline Yellow does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. Considering the evidence provided by the applicant, the Authority also concluded that the efficacy of Quinoline yellow with respect to the dose and the nature of the feedingstuffs and their processing cannot be assessed. However, the Authority also stated that for this additive, which is authorised in food, where the function for feed is the same as that for food, no further demonstration of efficacy might be necessary. As the recommended maximum level proposed by the Authority for this additive is similar to the levels authorised for food in different types of products, the Commission considered that there is sufficient evidence of the efficacy of this substance. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The assessment of Quinoline Yellow shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The substance specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018sensory additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018colourants: substances that add or restore colour in feedingstuffs\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "The substance specified in the Annex and feed containing that substance, and which are produced and labelled before 9 March 2017 in accordance with the rules applicable before 9 March 2015, may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 16 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 18.10.2003, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (OJ L\u00a0270, 14.12.1970, p.\u00a01).\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nmg of active substance of kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12 %\nCategory of sensory additives.
