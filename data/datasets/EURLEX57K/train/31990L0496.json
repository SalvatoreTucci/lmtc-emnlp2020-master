For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a) 'nutrition labelling' means any information appearing on labelling and relating to:\n(i) energy value;\n(ii) the following nutrients:\n- protein,\n- carbohydrate,\n- fat,\n- fibre,\n- sodium,\n- vitamins and minerals listed in the Annex and present in significant amounts as defined in that Annex.\nChanges to the list of vitamins, minerals and their recommended daily allowances shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10;\n(b) 'nutrition claim' means any representation and any advertising message which states, suggests or implies that a foodstuff has particular nutrition properties due to the energy (calorific value) it\n- provides,\n- provides at a reduced or increased rate or\n- does not provide,\nand/or due to the nutrients it\n- contains,\n- contains in reduced or increased proportions or\n- does not contain.\nA reference to qualities or quantities of a nutrient does not constitute a nutrition claim in so far as it is required by legislation.\nIn accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10, it may be decided in certain cases whether the conditions described in this point are satisfied;\n(c) 'protein' means the protein content calculated using the formula: protein = total Kjeldahl nitrogen \u00d7 6,25;\n(d) 'carbohydrate' means any carbohydrate which is metabolized in man, and includes polyols;\n(e) 'sugars' means all monosaccharides and disaccharides present in food, but excludes polyols;\n(f) 'fat' means total lipids, and includes phospholipids;\n(g) 'saturates' means fatty acids without double bond;\n(h) 'mono-unsaturates' means fatty acids with one cis double bond;\n(i) 'polyunsaturates' means fatty acids with cis, cis-methylene interrupted double bonds;\n(j) 'fibre' means the material to be defined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 and measured by the method of analysis to be determined in accordance with that procedure;\n(k) 'average value' means the value which best represents the amount of the nutrient which a given food contains, and reflects allowances for seasonal variability, patterns of consumption and other factors which may cause the actual value to vary.", "1. Subject to paragraph 2, nutrition labelling shall be optional.\n2. Where a nutrition claim appears on labelling, in presentation or in advertising, with the exclusion of generic advertising, nutrition labelling shall be compulsory.", "The only nutrition claims permitted shall be those relating to energy, to the nutrients listed in Article 1 (4) (a) (ii) and to substances which belong to or which are components of a category of those nutrients.
