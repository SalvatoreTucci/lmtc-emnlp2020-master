That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20, Levucell SC10 ME), as a feed additive for lambs, to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019.\n(4) The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 was authorised without a time limit for dairy cows and cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005\u00a0(2) and, until 22 March 2017, for dairy goats and dairy sheep by Commission Regulation (EC) No 226/2007\u00a0(3).\n(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for lambs. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 16 July 2008\u00a0(4) that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20/Levucell SC10 ME) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It further concluded that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20/Levucell SC10 ME) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is safe for lambs. That opinion also states that that preparation can produce a beneficial effect on final weight and average daily gain. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018gut flora stabilisers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 195, 27.7.2005, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 64, 2.3.2007, p. 26.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) on a request from the European Commission on the safety and efficacy of Levucell SC20/Levucell SC10ME, a preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as feed additive for lambs for fattening.
