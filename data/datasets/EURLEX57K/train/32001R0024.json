Application of that new amount in the beef and veal sector would lead to a considerable number of import licences not being returned to the issuing agency and there would therefore be no statistical information on licences for that sector. That provision should therefore be derogated from by applying the previous threshold of EUR 5.\n(3) Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 in effect increases the maximum amount for which Member States have the option of not requiring the lodging of a security under certain conditions from EUR 100 to EUR 500. As Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 derogates from the previous provision of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 on this matter for statistical reasons, the new provision should similarly be derogated from, as should Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(8).\n(4) The fourth subparagraph of Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 increases the maximum amount up to which a security that would be forfeit for a given licence or certificate is to be released in full by the Member State from EUR 5 to EUR 60. That provision involves an inherent risk that a number of import licences will not be returned or, on some of the licences returned, the country of origin will not be indicated. That would mean that the statistics on the beef and veal sector would be incomplete. That provision should therefore be derogated from by applying the previous maximum amount of EUR 5.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["Article 6c of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 is replaced by the following:\n\"Article 6c\n1.
