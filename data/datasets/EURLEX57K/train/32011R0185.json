Furthermore, unused volumes of the tariff quotas for some products for the tariff quota period 1 March 2011 to 30 April 2011 should be carried over to the corresponding tariff quotas for the period 1 May 2011 to 30 April 2012.\n(5) In order to implement the tariff quotas provided for in the Additional Protocol, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 499/96.\n(6) It is necessary to replace the current reference in Regulation (EC) No 499/96 to free-at-frontier prices by a reference to the declared customs value in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products\u00a0(3), and to provide that in order to qualify for the preferences laid down in the Additional Protocol, that value must at least be equal to any reference price fixed or to be fixed in accordance with the same Regulation.\n(7) Protocol 3 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland defining the concept of originating products and setting out the arrangements for administrative cooperation has been amended by Decision No 2/2005 of the EC-Iceland Joint Committee of 22 December 2005\u00a0(4). It is therefore necessary to provide explicitly that Protocol 3 as amended in 2005 is to apply.\n(8) Within the agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products undertaken on the basis of Article 19 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, attached to Council Decision 2007/138/EC\u00a0(5), the bilateral trade in live horses was liberalised between the European Union and Iceland for unlimited quantities. Therefore the tariff quota laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 499/96 for live horses is redundant.\n(9) For reasons of clarity and to take account of the amendments of the Combined Nomenclature Codes, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\u00a0(6), and of the TARIC subdivisions, it is appropriate to replace the complete Annex to Regulation (EC) No 499/96.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No 499/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(11) In accordance with Decision 2010/674/EU the new tariff quotas for certain fish and fishery products have to apply from 1 March 2011. This Regulation should therefore apply from the same date.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 499/96 is amended as follows:\n1. the title is replaced by the following:\n2.
