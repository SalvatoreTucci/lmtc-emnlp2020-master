This description shows that the rules concerning production which apply to \u2018Ron de Guatemala\u2019 are stricter than those applying to the standard rum produced in that country.\n(5) The application for the registration of \u2018Ron de Guatemala\u2019 as a geographical indication satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 110/2008. The Commission considers that, according to the specifications of the technical file, the product complies with the relevant requirements of Union law.\n(6) In the light of the above, the Commission has considered that the grounds provided in the oppositions to the registration of the geographical indication \u2018Ron de Guatemala\u2019 in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008, concerning the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided in the said Regulation, are not founded.\n(7) The name \u2018Ron de Guatemala\u2019 should be registered as a geographical indication in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Spirit Drinks,", "main_body": ["In Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008, in product category \u20181.
