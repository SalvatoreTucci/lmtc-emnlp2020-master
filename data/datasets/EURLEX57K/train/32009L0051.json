As regards purity, Directive 2008/40/EC sets a minimum level of 930\u00a0g/kg. That level was based on the specification submitted by the notifier.\n(2) However, it is the usual practice to base the level of minimum purity on specifications drafted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations as regards purity and levels of impurity contained in active substances. The FAO specification on nicosulfuron\u00a0(3) gives the minimum purity of 910\u00a0g/kg. That specification was included in the assessment report which was peer reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and presented to the Commission on 29\u00a0November 2007 for nicosulfuron, in the format of the EFSA Scientific Report\u00a0(4). Although the Community is entitled to set its own level of protection for public health, animal health and the environment, it is the general practice to use the FAO levels. To allow other producers complying with the FAO level to market their products, it is necessary to adapt the specification accordingly.\n(3) It is therefore justified to modify the minimum purity for nicosulfuron.\n(4) Since Article 2 of Directive 2008/40/EC requires Member States to apply the provisions implementing that Directive from 1 July 2009, the amended specification for nicosulfuron should also apply from this date, without prejudice to the other deadlines laid down by Article 3 of Directive 2008/40/EC. As a consequence, this Directive should enter into force as quickly as possible.\n(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In line 176 (nicosulfuron) of Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, in column 4 (purity), the words \u2018930\u00a0g/kg\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018910\u00a0g/kg\u2019.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 30 June 2009 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
