Without the addition of an emulsifier the flavouring oil would not be soluble and would appear on the surface of the beverage as an oily ring. This prevents the even dispersal of the flavouring through the beverage and increases its exposure to oxygen, leading to reduced organoleptic acceptability. It also makes the development of clear beverages extremely difficult. These issues can be overcome to some extent with the use of washed oils, however those have reduced organoleptic acceptability. The use of Sucrose esters of fatty acids enables clear beverages with improved functionality of the added flavouring.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(7) The European Food Safety Authority issued an opinion on sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) and established an Acceptable Dalily Intake of 40\u00a0mg/kg bw/day\u00a0(3). The exposure to sucrose esters of fatty acids resulting from the additional proposed use in clear flavoured soft drinks represents less than 0,1% of the ADI\u00a0(4). Taking into account that the exposure due to the additional use of this additive is negligible compared to the ADI, this additional use of Sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) is not liable to have an effect on human health.\n(8) It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of Sucrose esters of fatty acids (E 473) as a food additive in flavourings for water based clear flavoured drinks.\n(9) Therefore, Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,", "main_body": ["Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 28 August 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal (2004) 106, 1-24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012; 10(5):2658.\nANNEX\nIn Part 4 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entry is inserted after the entry for food additive E 459:\n\"E 473 Sucrose esters of fatty acids Flavourings for water based clear flavoured drinks that belong to category 14.1.4 15\u00a0000\u00a0mg/kg in flavourings, 30\u00a0mg/l in the final food\""}
