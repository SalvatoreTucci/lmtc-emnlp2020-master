GENERAL REMARKS  This programme relates to the whole of the Spanish fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Spain, including the Canaries, Ceuta and Melilla, in accordance with Article 50 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86.\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 592 662 GRT and 1 720 881 kW, in accordance with point II.2;\n(b) to restructure all categories of vessel in the fishing fleet by the renewal of some 3 % of vessels measuring between five and nine or 12 metres in length between perpendiculars and by the renewal of approximately 4 % of the vessels measuring over  nine or 12 metres in length between perpendiculars;\n(c) to stabilize the tuna freezer fleet at 67 918 GRT and 138 133 kW, on the understanding that, if the fished capacity of the tuna purse seiners is expanded beyond the objectives and limits laid down in the programme for this category, this shall not  affect the achievement of the overall objectives of the programme and provided that such expansion does not call for any Community financial assistance towards the utilization of the fishing capacities concerned. Such expansion may not affect the  reference data to be taken into consideration by the Community for the purposes of establishing and conduction reactions with third countries;\n(d) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong.\n2. During the period covered by the programme, the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n- fishing vessels appearing on the basic list, the numbers of which must meet the requirements specified in point IV.3 below,\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\n- vessels used solely for bivalve fishing,\nmust remain within the following limits:\nTonnage  (in GRT)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nSpecialized vessels of less than 6 m (between perpendiculars)\n14 153\n10 737\n10 522 (\u00b3)\nVessels from 6 to 9 or 12 m (between perpendiculars)\n27 638\n19 970\n19 571 (\u00b3)\nVessels over 9 or 12 m (between perpendiculars) of which:\n- national waters\n138 853\n127 660\n125 107 (\u00b3)\n- non-Spanish Community\nwaters\n52 825\n50 463\n49 454 (\u00b3)\n- third-country waters\n340 256\n328 009\n320 091 (\u00b3)\n- tuna freezers\n58 113\n67 918\n67 918 (\u00b3)\nTotal A\n613 530\n631 838\n579 189\n629 130\n612 881\n604 757\n592 662 (\u00b9)\nBasic list (\u00b3)\n65 874\n64 114\n63 756\nVessels used for aquaculture and for bivalve fishing\n5 628\n8 337\nTotal B\n685 032\n704 829\n(\u00b9) Including fishing vessels built prior to 1 January 1987, (of which 29 789 GRT and 68 608 kW) and which have not yet been commissioned.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\n(\u00b3) Within the meaning of Article 158 of the Act of Accession.\nEngine power  (in kW)\nType\nObjectives of\n1986\nprogramme at\n31. 12. 1986\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1987\n(\u00b9)\nSituation at\n1. 1. 1992\nObjectives at\n31. 12. 1989\n31. 12. 1990\n31. 12. 1991\nObjective at\n31. 12. 1992\nSpecialized vessels of less than 6 m (between perpendiculars)\n28 346\n29 607\n29 015 (\u00b3)\nVessels from 6 to 9 or 12 m (between perpendiculars)\n141 265\n135 901\n133 183 (\u00b3)\nVessels over 9 or 12 m (between perpendiculars) of which:\n- national waters\n549 292\n546 030\n535 109 (\u00b3)\n- non-Spanish Community\nwaters\n168 518\n167 126\n163 783 (\u00b3)\n- third-country waters\n723 956\n739 204\n721 658 (\u00b3)\n- tuna freezers\n123 890\n138 133\n138 133 (\u00b3)\nTotal A\n1 776 610\n1 831 554\n1 715 181\n1 823 999\n1 778 667\n1 756 001\n1 720 881 (\u00b9)\nBasic list (\u00b3)\n162 827\n160 597\n160 013\nVessels used for aquaculture and for bivalve fishing\n27 220\n50 264\nTotal B\n1 966 657\n2 042 415\n(\u00b9) Including fishing vessels built prior to 1 January 1987, (of which 29 789 GRT and 68 608 kW) and which have not yet been commissioned.\n(\u00b2) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\n(\u00b3) Within the meaning of Article 158 of the Act of Accession.\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at point II.2, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992, account must also be  taken of changes in fishing capacity resulting from:\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission (\u00b9),\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1992, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction  achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in point III.1.1 is reduced as planned:\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with new vessels, in line with the guidelines and objectives laid down at  point II.2,\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reduction which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n- the adoption of administrative measures to forestall any potential increases in fishing capacity which would be contrary to the aims of the programme,\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n(\u00b9) Overall capacity may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programmes's objectives.\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity.\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objective for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 12. 1991 which were  achieved by Member States (\u00b9) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while  the remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n3. The numbers of fishing vessels operating in Community waters and appearing on the basic list as defined in Article 158 of the Act of Accession must remain within the limits set by the said Act, and in particular Article 159 thereof.\n4. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n(\u00b9) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 91."}
