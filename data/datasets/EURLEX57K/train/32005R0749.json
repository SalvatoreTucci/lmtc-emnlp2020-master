As a result of these additional costs, cereals are more difficult to export from those Member States, which results in particular in longer intervention storage and additional costs to the Community budget. Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 therefore provides for the possibility, in certain cases, of financing the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the place of exit, in order to make the tenders comparable.\n(3) The Croation ports of Rijeka and Split were traditional ports of exit for the countries of central Europe before their accession to the Union. Rijeka and Split should therefore be included among the places of exit that can be considered when calculating the refundable transport costs for exports.\n(4) In order to simplify and harmonise the procedures for the placing on sale of cereals for export, the procedure for releasing the guarantees referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should be clarified, based on Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products\u00a0(3), especially as regards the proof that the import customs formalities have been completed in a third country.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["In Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2131/93, paragraph 2a is replaced by the following:\n\u20182a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Member States have no sea port, a decision may be taken, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1, to derogate from paragraph 2 and, in the case of exports from a sea port, to finance the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the actual place of exit, within the financial limits laid down in the tender notice.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph the Romanian port of Constan\u0163a and the Croatian ports of Rijeka and Split may be regarded as places of exit.\u2019", "In Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 2131/93, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The security provided for in the second indent of paragraph 2 shall be released where it covers quantities in respect of which:\n\u2014 proof has been furnished that the goods have become unfit for human or animal consumption,\n\u2014 proof has been furnished that the customs formalities for exports outside the customs territory of the Community and for imports into one of the third countries covered by the tender have been completed.
