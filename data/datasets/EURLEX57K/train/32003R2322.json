This situation is expected to cause a significant reduction in closing stocks for 2003/04 on the Community market. A normal 2004 harvest would not be expected to lead to a significant increase in stocks. A poor harvest would expose the internal market to potentially serious risks.\n(3) For the 2004/05 marketing year, the rate for set-aside should therefore be fixed at a lower level than that set out in the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999, the basic rate of compulsory set-aside shall be 5 % for the 2004/05 marketing year.", "1.
