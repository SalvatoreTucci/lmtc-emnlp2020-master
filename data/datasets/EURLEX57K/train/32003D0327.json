In addition, it provides that appropriate transitional measures may be adopted.\n(2) In view of the strict nature of those requirements, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for Finland and the United Kingdom in order to allow industry sufficient time to adjust. In addition, alternative collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and uses for animal by-products need to be further developed as well as disposal methods for those by-products.\n(3) Accordingly, as a temporary measure a derogation should be granted to Finland and the United Kingdom to enable them to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules for the low capacity incineration or co-incineration plants which do not incinerate or co-incinerate specified risk material or carcases containing them.\n(4) In order to prevent a risk to animal and public health, appropriate control systems should be maintained in Finland and the United Kingdom for the period of the transitional measures.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Derogation regarding the low capacity incineration or co-incineration plants\n1.
