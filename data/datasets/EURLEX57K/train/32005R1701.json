Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.\n(2) In particular, it is appropriate to specify the application of the definition of permanent crops and multiannual crops in relation to the eligibility conditions for the single payment scheme in case of use of land set aside for the production of raw materials as laid down in Chapter 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 of 29 October 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the support schemes provided for in Titles IV and IVa of that Regulation and the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials\u00a0(3) and in relation to the energy crops aid scheme referred to in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n(3) In particular, under the previous regime for arable crops provided for by Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops\u00a0(4), set-aside land which was planted with permanent crops used for the production of raw materials or land planted with multiannual crops were eligible to area payments. Article 54(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 limits the eligibility to areas which were not under permanent crops at the date of application for 2003 whilst it does not exclude, in application of Article 53 of that Regulation those areas under permanent crops used for the production of raw materials from the establishment of the payment entitlements as those areas were granted direct payments in the reference period. It is therefore appropriate to allow farmers who cultivated in 2003 such crops under that specific regime for set-aside or multiannual crops to use that land respectively for the establishment of set-aside entitlements referred to in Article 53 of that Regulation and for the use of the established set-aside entitlements.\n(4) Moreover, as far as in the regional model provided for by Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the reference year for the establishment of the payment entitlements is the first year of application of the scheme as provided for by Article 38(1) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004, it is appropriate to specify that set-aside land planted with permanent crops used for the purposes referred to in Article 55(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and land planted with permanent crops and which are also subject to an application for the aid for energy crops provided for in Article 88 of that Regulation should be considered as eligible hectares for the establishment and use of payment entitlements.\n(5) In addition, it is necessary to specify which crops are allowed on set-aside land and which crops are allowed for energy purposes on land subject to an application for the single payment scheme. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the possibility to use payment entitlements in accordance with the eligibility conditions set up for areas under permanent crops used for the production of raw materials as laid down in Chapter 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 and for crops used for the production of energy products under the scheme provided for in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Due to the fact that Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 applies as from 1 January 2005, it is appropriate to provide that this Regulation applies retroactively from that date and consequently authorise farmers concerned by the application in 2005 to modify their single application.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.
