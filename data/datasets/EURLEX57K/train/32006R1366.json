The HCFC market in the 10 new Member\u00a0States has changed considerably since 1999, with the arrival of new companies and\u00a0changes in market shares. Taking 1999 as the base year for allocating quotas of HCFCs in these new Member States would result in a large number of companies not receiving an import quota. This could be\u00a0considered as being arbitrary and might also result in a breach of the principles of non-discrimination and legitimate expectations.\n(2) As a general rule, quotas should be based on the most recent and representative figures available in order to ensure that a number of importing companies in the new Member\u00a0States are not excluded. It is therefore appropriate to\u00a0choose the years for which the most recent data are available. In order to best reflect the commercial situation on the HCFC\u00a0market in the 10 new Member States, average market\u00a0shares in 2002 and\u00a02003 should therefore be used as the basis for the companies from those Member States.\n(3) Regulation (EC) No\u00a02037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["The following point shall be added to Article\u00a04(3)(i) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a02037/2000:\n\u2018(i) by way of derogation from point\u00a0(h), each producer and\u00a0importer in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia shall ensure that the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which it places on the market or uses for its own account shall not exceed, as a percentage of the calculated levels set out in points\u00a0(b), (d), (e) and\u00a0(f), the average of its percentage market share in 2002 and\u00a02003.\u2019\n.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official\u00a0Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1\u00a0January\u00a02007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 6\u00a0September\u00a02006.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
