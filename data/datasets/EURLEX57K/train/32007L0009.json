Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected.\n(2) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data.\n(3) A Member State informed the Commission of its desire to revise national MRLs in accordance with Article\u00a08 of Directive 90/642/EEC in the light of concerns about consumer intake. Proposals for the review of Community MRLs were submitted to the Commission.\n(4) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the pesticides referred to in this Directive via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(2). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.\n(5) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to those pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects.\n(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community's trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account.\n(7) At the request of the Commission, EFSA\u00a0(3) has given an opinion on the risk of the aldicarb MRLs in this Directive.\n(8) The Annexes to Directives 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of Annex\u00a0II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall adopt and publish, by 1\u00a0September 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
