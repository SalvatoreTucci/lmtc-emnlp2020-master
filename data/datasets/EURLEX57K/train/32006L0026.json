In relation to the maximum limits laid down in Directive 77/311/EEC for the driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors, the test speed established in Annexes I and II to that Directive should therefore be harmonised with the test speed required in global technical regulations or standards such as OECD Code 5 and ISO 5131:1996\u00a0(6).\n(3) It is appropriate to adapt the requirements introduced by Directive 78/933/EEC relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, so as to meet present needs for simpler design and better illumination.\n(4) The requirements laid down in Directive 89/173/EEC relating to glazing and coupling of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors should be brought into line with recent technological developments. In particular, polycarbonate/plastic glazing should be permitted for non-windscreen applications to enhance the protection of the occupants in the event of objects penetrating the driver cab area. The requirements concerning mechanical couplings should be aligned with the standard ISO 6489-1. Furthermore, with a view to reducing the number and severity of accidents and to enhancing occupational safety, it is appropriate not only to make additional provision as regards hot surfaces, but also to lay down measures concerning battery terminal covers, as well as measures designed to prevent unintentional uncoupling.\n(5) Directives 74/151/EEC, 77/311/EEC, 78/933/EEC and 89/173/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Directive 74/151/EEC\nDirective 74/151/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.", "Amendment to Directive 77/311/EEC\nDirective 77/311/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.", "Amendment to Directive 78/933/EEC\nDirective 78/933/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Directive.", "Amendment to Directive 89/173/EEC\nDirective 89/173/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex IV to this Directive.", "Transitional provisions\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 January 2007, with respect to vehicles which comply with the requirements laid down respectively in Directives 74/151/EEC, 78/933/EEC, 77/311/EEC and 89/173/EEC as amended by this Directive, Member States shall not, on grounds relating to the subject-matter of the Directive concerned:\n(a) refuse to grant EC type-approval or to grant national type-approval;\n(b) prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of such a vehicle.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 July 2007, with respect to vehicles which do not comply with the requirements laid down respectively in Directives 74/151/EEC, 78/933/EEC, 77/311/EEC and 89/173/EEC as amended by this Directive, and on grounds relating to the subject-matter of the Directive concerned, Member States:\n(a) shall no longer grant EC type-approval;\n(b) may refuse to grant national type-approval.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1 July 2009, with respect to vehicles which do not comply with the requirements laid down respectively in Directives 74/151/EEC, 78/933/EEC, 77/311/EEC and 89/173/EEC as amended by this Directive, and on grounds relating to the subject-matter of the Directive concerned, Member States:\n(a) shall consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2003/37/EC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1);\n(b) may refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of those new vehicles.", "Transposition\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2006 at the latest.
