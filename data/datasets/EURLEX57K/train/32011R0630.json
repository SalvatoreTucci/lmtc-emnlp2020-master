Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased, from 1 July 2011 in the case of the tariff quotas with the order numbers 09.2767 and 09.2813, and from 1 January 2011 in the case of tariff quotas with the order numbers 09.2977, 09.2628, 09.2629 and 09.2635.\n(3) Moreover, for the autonomous tariff quota of the Union with the order number 09.2631 the product description should be revised.\n(4) In addition, it is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant a tariff quota for the second semester of 2011 in respect of the tariff quota with the order number 09.2947. That quota should therefore be closed with effect from 1 July 2011 and the corresponding row should be deleted from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.\n(5) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since some of the measures provided for in this Regulation should take effect from 1 January 2011 and others from 1 July 2011, this Regulation should apply from those dates respectively and enter into force immediately,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2767, 09.2813 and 09.2631 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex I to this Regulation;\n(2) the rows for the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2977, 09.2628, 09.2629 and 09.2635 are replaced by the rows set out in Annex II to this Regulation;\n(3) the row for the tariff quota with order number 09.2947 is deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2011.\nHowever, point (2) of Article 1 shall apply from 1 January 2011.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 21 June 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nFAZEKAS S.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 7.1.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nTariff quotas referred to in point (1) of Article 1\nOrder number CN code TARIC Description Quota period Quota volume Quota duty\n09.2767 ex\u00a02910\u00a090\u00a000 80 Allyl glycidyl ether 1.1.-31.12. 4\u00a0300\u00a0tonnes 0\u00a0%\n09.2813 ex\u00a03920\u00a091\u00a000 94 Co-extruded trilayer poly(vinyl butyral) film without a graduated colour band containing by weight 29\u00a0% or more but not more than 31\u00a0% of 2,2'-ethylenedioxydiethyl bis(2-ethylhexanoate) as a plasticiser 1.1.-31.12. 3\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0m2 0\u00a0%\n09.2631 ex\u00a09001\u00a090\u00a000 80 Unmounted glass lenses, prisms and cemented elements for use in the manufacture of goods of CN codes 9002, 9005, 9013\u00a010 and 9015 (1) 1.1.-31.12. 5\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0units 0\u00a0%\nANNEX II\nTariff quotas referred to in point (2) of Article 1\nOrder number CN code TARIC Description Quota period Quota amount Quota duty\n09.2977 2926\u00a010\u00a000  Acrylonitrile 1.1.-31.12. 50\u00a0000 tonnes 0\u00a0%\n09.2628 ex\u00a07019\u00a052\u00a000 10 Glass web woven from glass fibre coated in plastic, of a weight of 120\u00a0g/m2 (\u00b1 10\u00a0g/m2), of a type used in rolling insect screens with fixed frames 1.1.-31.12. 1\u00a0900\u00a0000\u00a0m2 0\u00a0%\n09.2629 ex\u00a07616\u00a099\u00a090 85 Aluminium telescopic handle for use in the manufacture of luggage (1) 1.1.-31.12. 600\u00a0000 units 0\u00a0%\n09.2635 ex\u00a09001\u00a010\u00a090 20 Optical fibres for the manufacture of glass fibre cables under heading 8544 (1) 1.1.-31.12. 3\u00a0300\u00a0000\u00a0km 0\u00a0%"}
