The most appropriate method for this purpose would be that using the quota by chronological order of acceptance of the declarations of release for free circulation (the \u2018first come, first served\u2019 method). Nevertheless, in order to ensure continuity of trade with ACP countries and, therefore, satisfactory supplies for the Community market while avoiding disturbances in trade flows, Commission Regulation (EC) No 219/2006\u00a0(2) reserved, on a transitional basis, part of the tariff quota for operators who supplied the Community with ACP bananas in the framework of the import regime previously in force. Taking into account the transitional nature of that provision, it appears appropriate to progressively eliminate it and hence ensuring for 2007 a substantial increase in the part of the tariff quota managed by the first come, first served method, by increasing the proportion of imports carried out under that system from 60\u00a0% to 81\u00a0%.\n(4) Provision should therefore be made for a total quantity of 146\u00a0848 tonnes of the tariff quota to be reserved for the operators who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community during 2006 That proportion of the tariff quota should be administered by means of import licences issued to each operator in proportion to the quantities imported on the basis of licences received by these operators under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.\n(5) In view of the quantities available, a ceiling should be set for the licence application which each operator may lodge for the period until 31 December 2007.\n(6) Access to the rest of the tariff quota should be open to all operators established in the Community on a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(3).\n(7) This Regulation should enter into force immediately in order to enable licence applications to be lodged in time.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["CHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS", "Subject\nThe zero-duty tariff quota for the import of bananas falling under CN code 0803\u00a000\u00a019 originating in ACP countries provided for in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 is hereby opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 2007.", "Available quantities\nThe quantities available under the tariff quota are set at 775\u00a0000 tonnes, of which:\n(a) 146\u00a0848 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter II and have the serial number 09.4164.\n(b) 628\u00a0152 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter III and have the order numbers: 09.1634, 09.1638, 09.1639, 09.1640, 09.1642, 09.1644.\nCHAPTER II\nIMPORTS OF THE QUANTITIES PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE\u00a02(A)", "Import licences\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All imports under the quantity fixed in Article 2(a) shall be subject to the lodging of an import licence issued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(4) shall be applicable, with the exception of Article 8(4) and (5), subject to the provisions of this Regulation.", "Lodging licence applications\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Economic operators established in the Community who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community in 2006, on the basis of licences issued under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006, shall be entitled to lodge import licence applications.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantities applied for by each operator may not exceed 110\u00a0% of the quantity imported on the basis of licences allocated to him under chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Import licence applications must be lodged by each operator on 8 and 9 January 2007 with the competent authorities of the Member State which issued him in 2006 with the import licences for the quantities referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe competent authorities in each Member State shall be as listed in the Annex.
