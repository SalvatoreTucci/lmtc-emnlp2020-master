Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2000/53/EC, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(5) Since the Commission has laid down the implementing rules referred to in Article 5(5), Article 7(2) and Article 8(2) of Directive 2000/53/EC by means of Decisions 2002/151/EC\u00a0(6), 2005/293/EC\u00a0(7) and 2003/138/EC\u00a0(8), it is appropriate to delete the references to the deadlines of 21 October 2001, 21 October 2002 and 21 October 2001 respectively.\n(6) Directive 2000/53/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Since the amendments made to Directive 2000/53/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.
