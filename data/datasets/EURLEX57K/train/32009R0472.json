Where a Member State introduces such an eight-year restructuring programme, the transfer to the national ceiling as determined in Annex VIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers\u00a0(3) should follow immediately.\n(3) Article 7(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 provides that the beneficiaries of the aid under Chapter IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton\u00a0(4) in the marketing year 2005/2006 are the beneficiaries of the measures referred to in Article 7(1)(a), (b) and (d) of Regulation (EC) No 637/2008. However, since some ginning factories were not operated by their owners in that reference marketing year and those owners were not beneficiaries under Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, those ginning factories were excluded from participating in the restructuring process. For the national restructuring programmes to be effective all ginning factories that were active in the reference marketing year 2005/2006 and eligible for support under Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 should be covered by the measures under Article 7(1)(a), (b) and (d) of Regulation (EC) No 637/2008. Therefore, it is appropriate that as regards that marketing year, the owner of the factory should qualify as the beneficiary under the restructuring programme concerned.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. in Article 4(1) the following subparagraph shall be inserted after the first subparagraph:\n2. in Article 5(2), the following subparagraph shall be added:\n3. in Article 7(2), point (a) shall be replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) the owners of the ginning facilities in respect of which aid under Chapter IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001\u00a0(5) was granted in the marketing year 2005/2006, for aid under the measures referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (d) of this Article;", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 May 2009.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nJ. \u0160EBESTA\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 291, 19.11.1979, p. 174.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 5.7.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 30, 31.1.2009, p. 16.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 3.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 1.6.2001, p. 3\u2019."}
