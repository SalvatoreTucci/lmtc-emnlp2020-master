whereas, in respect of paddy rice, Regulation (EEC) No 468/86 provides that the difference may be adjusted to make the products concerned comparable;\nWhereas, however, following the latest change in the intervention arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1907/87 (3), buying in is carried out at a level below the intervention price; whereas this level, which now represents the actual guarantee given to producers must, therefore, serve as a basis for calculating the accession compensatory amounts;\nWhereas, under Article 117 (5) of the Act, the accession compensatory amounts for processed products are to be dericed from those applicable to the products to which they are related, with the help of coefficients to be determined; whereas these coefficients are to be fixed having regard to technical factors in processing and also to the fact that the compensatory amounts will apply to imports, to exports and to trade between the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 and Spain;\nWhereas, under Article 117 (6) of the Act, the compensatory amount for broken rice must be fixed at a level that takes into account the difference between the supply price in Spain and the threshold price; whereas the difference recorded on 1 March 1986 should be reduced in seven stages;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals.", "main_body": ["For the period 1 September 1987 to 31 August 1988, the accession compensatory amounts applicable to the products referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) and (b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 shall be as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.\nThe following shall be as shown in the same Annex:\n- for the period 1 September 1987 to 31 August 1988, the accession compensatory amounts applicable to the products referred to in Article 1 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76,\n- the coefficients referred to in Article 117 (5) of the Act.", "This Regulationshall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 September 1987.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 29 July 1987.\nFor the Commission\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ No L 53, 1. 3. 1986, p. 28.\n(2) OJ No L 166, 25. 6. 1976, p. 1.\n(3) OJ No L 182, 3. 7. 1987, p. 51.\nANNEX\n(ECU/tonne)\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // CCT heading No  // Basic product  // Description  // Coefficient   // Accession compensatory amount   //    //   //   //   //   // 10.06   //  // Rice:   //   //   // B   //   // Other:   //   //   // I  //   // Paddy rice;
