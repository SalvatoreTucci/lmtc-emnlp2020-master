Such authorisations are required to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\n(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\n(3) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.\n(4) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.\n(5) Information on new or changed uses of certain pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC have been notified to the Commission.\n(6) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides, has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\u00a0(3). It has been calculated that the MRLs concerned will ensure that the acceptable daily intakes are not exceeded.\n(7) Where appropriate, the acute exposure of consumers to these pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.\n(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of those pesticides.\n(9) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The maximum pesticide residue levels for methomyl, thiodicarb, myclobutanil, maneb group, fenpropimorph, metalaxyl, metalaxyl-m, penconazole, iprovalicarb, azoxystrobin and fenhexamid in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC are replaced by those in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 22 June 2005 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
