Those acts are listed in the Annex to the Monetary Agreement.\n(2) The update of the Annex is made according to Article 8(3) of the Monetary Agreement which foresees that the Annex needs to be amended by the Commission every year to take into account the new relevant EU legal acts and rules and the amendments to the existing ones. Following this provision one act was repealed and two new Union acts, falling within the scope of Article 8(1) of the Monetary Agreement, have been adopted and should be included in the Annex.\n(3) Council Decision of 29 April 1999 extending Europol\u2019s mandate to deal with forgery of money and means of payment\u00a0(1) is obsolete and hence deleted from the Annex. As soon as the new legal instrument allowing Europol to sign cooperation agreements with third countries has entered into force, the new instrument will be added to the Annex to the Monetary Agreement.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 1210/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2010 concerns authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation\u00a0(2) has been adopted. It, therefore, falls within the scope of Article 8(1) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in the Annex.\n(5) Decision ECB/2010/14 of the European Central Bank of 16 September 2010 on the authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of euro banknotes\u00a0(3) was adopted. It falls within the scope of Article 8(1) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in the Annex.\n(6) The Annex to the Monetary Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly,",
