It is necessary to adjust the implementing rules to this possibility.\n(2) In view of the possible prolongation of the length of the programmes, the maximum percentage which may be paid in the form of advances must be increased. The conditions for release of the securities linked to these advances need to be specified, and it must be clarified that securities are not required for advances paid after full completion of the relevant tasks.\n(3) For reasons of non-discriminatory treatment of ginners, it is necessary that the controls referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1145/2008\u00a0(3) cover all the measures listed in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 637/2008.\n(4) Furthermore, the Member States responsibility to verify respect of the commitment not to use the production site for the ginning of cotton during a period of ten years from the moment of approval of the application for dismantling should be specified.\n(5) With a view to optimising the effects of the restructuring programmes, it is necessary to provide Member States with additional flexibility in setting the amount of aid for dismantling per tonne of unginned cotton, which takes into account the heterogeneity of the ginning industry, while in any case avoiding overcompensation.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 1145/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1145/2008 is amended as follows:\n1.
