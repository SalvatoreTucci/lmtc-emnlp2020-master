Article 6(1) of that Regulation stipulates that delivery must take place by the end of the second month following receipt of the offer and in any case not later than 31 August of the current marketing year.\n(2) As a result of the exceptionally large quantities of paddy rice currently offered for buying in, it is difficult for the intervention agencies to meet the time limit for the delivery of the products. This situation justifies a derogation, for the 2002/03 marketing year, from the time limit requiring delivery by the end of the second month.\n(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 708/98, the delivery of paddy rice for taking over by the intervention agency in respect of the 2002/03 marketing year must take place no later than 31 August 2003.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 June 2003.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n(2) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n(3) OJ L 98, 31.3.1998, p. 21.\n(4) OJ L 90, 30.3.2001, p. 17."}
