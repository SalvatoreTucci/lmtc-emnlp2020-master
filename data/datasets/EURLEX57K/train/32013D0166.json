The period of application of the derogation provided for in Directive 2008/72/EC for such imports should consequently be extended beyond 31 December 2012. The available evidence indicates that no problems have occurred regarding the compliance of imported material with the provisions of Directive 2008/72/EC. It is reasonably expected that imported material will continue to comply with Union legislation for a period of 10 years.\n(4) Directive 2008/72/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Materials for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["In the first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 2008/72/EC, the date \u201831 December 2012\u2019 is replaced by \u201831 December 2022\u2019.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 April 2013.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 205, 1.8.2008, p. 28."}
