The duties and quantities should be fixed in accordance with the respective international agreements in force during the year 2011.\n(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 312/2003 of 18 February 2003 implementing for the Community the tariff provisions laid down in the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part\u00a0(2) has provided for an additional bilateral tariff quota of 2\u00a0000 tonnes with a 10\u00a0% annual increase of the original quantity to be opened for product code 0204 from 1 February 2003. Therefore, a further 200 tonnes shall be added to the GATT/WTO quota for Chile and both quotas should continue to be managed in the same way during 2011.\n(3) Certain quotas are defined for a period running from 1 July of a given year to 30 June of the following year. Since imports under this Regulation should be managed on a calendar-year basis, the corresponding quantities to be fixed for the calendar year 2011 with regard to the quotas concerned are the sum of half of the quantity for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 and half of the quantity for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012.\n(4) A carcass-weight equivalent needs to be fixed in order to ensure a proper functioning of the Union tariff quotas.\n(5) Quotas of the sheepmeat and goatmeat products should, by way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1439/95 of 26 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 as regards the import and export of products in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector\u00a0(3), be managed in conformity with Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(4).\n(6) Tariff quotas under this Regulation should be regarded initially as non-critical within the meaning of Article 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 when managed under the first-come, first-served system. Therefore, customs authorities should be authorised to waive the requirement for security in respect of goods initially imported under those quotas in accordance with Articles 308c(1) and 248(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Due to the particularities of the transfer from one management system to the other, Article 308c(2) and (3) of that Regulation should not apply.\n(7) It should be clarified which kind of proof certifying the origin of products has to be provided by operators in order to benefit from the tariff quotas under the first-come, first served system.\n(8) When sheepmeat products are presented by operators to the customs authorities for import, it is difficult for those authorities to establish whether they originate from domestic sheep or other sheep, which determines the application of different duty rates. It is therefore appropriate to provide that the proof of origin contains a clarification to that end.\n(9) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1234/2009 of 15 December 2009 opening Community tariff quotas for 2010 for sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat\u00a0(5) becomes obsolete at the end of the year 2010. For this reason, it should be repealed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["This Regulation opens Union import tariff quotas for sheep, goats, sheepmeat and goatmeat for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2011.", "The customs duties applicable to the products under the quotas referred to in Article 1, the CN codes, the countries of origin, listed by country group, and the order numbers are set out in the Annex.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantities, expressed in carcass-weight equivalent, for the import of products under the quotas referred to in Article 1, shall be those as laid down in the Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of calculating the quantities of \u2018carcase weight equivalent\u2019 referred to in paragraph 1 the net weight of sheep and goat products shall be multiplied by the following coefficients:\n(a) for live animals: 0,47;\n(b) for boneless lamb and boneless goatmeat of kid: 1,67;\n(c) for boneless mutton, boneless sheep and boneless goatmeat other than of kid and mixtures of any of these: 1,81;\n(d) for bone-in products: 1,00.\n\u2018Kid\u2019 shall mean goat of up to 1 year old.", "By way of derogation from Title II (A) and (B) of Regulation (EC) No 1439/95, the tariff quotas set out in the Annex to this Regulation shall be managed on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 from 1 January to 31 December 2011.
