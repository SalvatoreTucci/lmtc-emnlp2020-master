Nevertheless, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year, according to market opportunities.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 of 7 May 2010 fixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2010/11 marketing year\u00a0(3) fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota isoglucose at 50\u00a0000 tonnes. Large part of this quantity has already been used. As of 12 July 2011 only 16\u00a0520 tonnes remain available, i.e. 67\u00a0% of the available quantity has been already used. Given the possible market outlets for out-of-quota isoglucose, it is appropriate to increase the export quantitative limit by 15\u00a0000 tonnes.\n(4) Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Article 2(1) to Regulation (EU) No 397/2010 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the 2010/11 marketing year, running from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011, the quantitative limit referred to in Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) 1234/2007 shall be 65\u00a0000 tonnes, in dry matter, for exports without refund of out-of-quota isoglucose falling within CN codes 1702\u00a040\u00a010, 1702\u00a060\u00a010 and 1702\u00a090\u00a030.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 August 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 178, 1.7.2006, p. 24.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 8.5.2010, p. 26."}
