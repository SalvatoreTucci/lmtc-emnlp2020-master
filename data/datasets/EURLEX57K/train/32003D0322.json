Also, feeding programmes of wild species such as necrophagous birds should not become an alternative way of disposal of fallen ruminant stock posing a TSE risk nor of specified risk material.\n(4) Feeding of necrophagous birds with certain category 1 material may, therefore, be considered permissible on the basis of the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee.\n(5) Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal have submitted requests for the authorisation of feeding of certain species of necrophagous birds with certain category 1 material.\n(6) Those requests fulfil the conditions required in the scientific opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee. However, additional justification should be required to verify that there is no other way to conserve those species of necrophagous birds other than by feeding them with certain category 1 material, thereby leading to an unnecessary increase of potentially TSE-transmitting sources.\n(7) In order to prevent a risk to animal or public health, it is necessary to lay down rules to be applied when authorising the feeding of those necrophagous birds with certain category 1 material.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Implementing rules on the feeding of necrophagous birds with category 1 material\nPursuant to Article 23(2)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal may authorise the use of entire bodies of dead animals which may contain specified risk material as referred to in Article 4 (1)(b)(ii) of that Regulation for the feeding of the endangered or protected species of necrophagous birds as set out in part A of the Annex to this Decision.", "Authorisation and control measures by the competent authority\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority may grant authorisation to the person responsible for the feeding of the necrophagous birds referred to in Article 1.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority shall only grant authorisation as provided for in paragraph 1 if the specific requirements laid down in part B of the Annex are complied with.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority shall take the necessary measures to supervise and control compliance with the specific requirements laid down in part B of the Annex.\nThose measures shall include strict supervision of the health status of the animals in the region where the feeding takes place, and an appropriate TSE surveillance involving regular sampling and laboratory examination for TSEs.
