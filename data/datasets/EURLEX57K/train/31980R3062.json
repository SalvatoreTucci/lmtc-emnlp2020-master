The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the principles and rules which will govern, in all respects, the fishing activities of vessels of either Party within the fishing zones falling under the jurisdiction of the other Party.\n2. However, this Agreement shall not affect the reciprocal fishing arrangements of fishermen in the Bidassoa waters and in the Bay of Figuer as defined by the Agreement of 14 July 1959 between Spain and France.\nArticle 2\nEach Party shall grant access to the fishing zone falling under its jurisdiction to the fishing vessels of the other Party under the conditions laid down by the following Articles.\nArticle 3\n1. Each Party shall determine each year, for the fishing zone falling under its jurisdiction, subject to adjustments necessitated by unforeseen circumstances, and on the basis of the need for rational management of the biological resources:    (a) the total allowable catch for individual stocks or complexes of stocks, taking into account the most reliable scientific information available to it, the interdependence of stocks, the work of appropriate international organizations and other relevant factors;\n(b) after appropriate reciprocal consultations, the catch allotted to the fishing vessels of the other Party and the zones in which these catches may be made. The two Parties shall have as their objective the attainment of a satisfactory balance between their respective fishing possibilities in the fishing  zones falling under the jurisdiction of the other Party.\nIn determining these possibilities, each Party shall take into account:    (i) the advantage of preserving the traditional characteristics of fishery activities in the frontier coastal areas;\n(ii) the need to minimize the difficulties encountered by the Party whose fishing possibilities may be reduced in the course of achieving the abovementioned balance;\n(iii) all other relevant factors.\n2. Each Party shall be able to take any other measures to ensure the conservation and rational management of resources in the fishing zones falling under its jurisdiction. Such measures when taken following the annual fixing of the other Party's fishing possibilities, should not be such as to compromise the effective operation of fishing.\nArticle 4\nEach Party may require that in the fishing zone falling under its jurisdiction fishing by vessels of the other Party shall be subject to licence.\nThe competent authorities of each Party shall communicate to the other Party the name, registration number and other relevant particulars of vessels requesting authorization to fish in the fishing zone of the other Party. This provision shall also apply to any vessel intended to aid or assist a fishing vessel in carrying out tasks directly related to the latter's fishing activity. The second Party shall issue licences commensurate with the possibilities for fishing granted under Article 3 (1) (b).\nArticle 5\nFishing vessels of one Party shall, when fishing within the fishing zone falling under the jurisdiction of the other Party, comply with the conservation measures, supervisory measures and other provisions governing fishing activities in that zone. Due advance notice shall be given of any new measures, conditions or provisions.\nArticle 6\nEach Party shall take all necessary measures to ensure that its fishing vessels comply with the provisions of this Agreement and with other related measures.\nArticle 7\nWithin the fishing zone falling under its jurisdiction, each Party may, in conformity with international law, take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that vessels of the other Party comply with the provisions of this Agreement.\nArticle 8\nThe Parties undertake to cooperate to ensure the proper management and conservation of the biological resources of the sea, and to facilitate the necessary scientific research in this respect, in particular with regard to:    (a) fish stocks living within the fishing zones falling under the jurisdiction of both the Parties, with a view to achieving, as far as possible, harmonization of measures to regulate the fishing of such stocks;\n(b) fish stocks of common interest living within the fishing zones falling under the jurisdiction of both Parties and in the areas beyond and adjacent to those zones.\nArticle 9\nThe Parties agree to consult on questions relating to the implementation and proper functioning of this Agreement or, in the event of a dispute, on questions concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement.\nArticle 10\nNo provision of this Agreement shall affect or prejudice the position of either Party with respect to questions relating to the Law of the Sea.\nArticle 11\nThis Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied, and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty, and, on the other hand, to the territory of Spain.\nArticle 12\nThis Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the Parties notify each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for the purpose. Pending its entry into force, the Agreement shall apply provisionally as from the date of signature.\nThis Agreement shall remain in force for an initial period of five years after its entry into force. In the event of the Agreement not being terminated by either Party through notice of termination given at least six months before the expiry of that period, it shall remain in force for additional periods of five years, provided that notice of termination has not been given at least six months before the expiry of any such period.\nArticle 13\nThe Parties agree to examine this Agreement on the conclusion of the negotiations for a Multilateral Treaty, which are being conducted within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\nUdf\u00e6rdiget i Bruxeles, den femtende april nitten hundrede og firs i to eksemplarer p\u00e5 dansk, engelsk, fransk, italiensk, nederlandsk, tysk og spansk, idet hver af disse tekster har samme gyldighed.\nGeschehen zu Br\u00fcssel am f\u00fcnfzehnten April neunzehnhundertachtzig in zwei Urschriften in d\u00e4nischer, deutscher, englischer, franz\u00f6sischer, italienischer, niederl\u00e4ndischer und spanischer Sprache, wobei jeder Wortlaut gleicherma\u00dfen verbindlich ist.\nDone at Brussels on the fifteenth day of April in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty, in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages, each of these texts being equally authentic.\nFait \u00e0 Bruxelles, le quinze avril mil neuf cent quatre-vingts, en double exemplaire, en langues allemande, anglaise, danoise, fran\u00e7aise, italienne, n\u00e9erlandaise et espagnole, chacun de ces textes faisant \u00e9galement foi.\nFatto a Bruxelles, il quindici aprile milleovecentoottanta, in duplice copia in lingua danese, francese, inglese, italiana, olandese, tedesca e spagnuola, ciascuno di detti testi facente ugualmente fede.\nGedaan te Brussel, op vijftien april negentienhonderd tachtig, in twee exemplaren in de Deense, de Duitse, de Engelse, de Franse, de Italiaanse, de Nederlandse en de Spaanse taal, zijnde alle teksten gelijkelijk authentiek.\nHecho en Bruselas a quinze de abril de mil novecientos ochenta en dos ejemplares en lengua espa\u00f1ola, alemana, danesa, francesa, inglesa, italiana y neerlandesa, dando fe cada uno de estos textos.\nFor R\u00e5det for De europ\u00e6iske F\u00e6llesskaber,\nF\u00fcr den Rat der Europ\u00e4ischen Gemeinschaften,\nFor the Council of the European Communities,\nPour le Conseil des Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes,\nPer il Consiglio delle Comunit\u00e0 europee,\nVoor de Raad van de Europese Gemeenschappen,\nEn nombre del Consejo de las Comunidades Europeas, >PIC FILE= \"T0016452\">\nFor regeringen for Spanien,\nF\u00fcr die Regierung von Spanien,\nFor the Government of Spain,\nPour le gouvernement de l'Espagne,\nPer il governo di Spagna,\nVoor de Regering van Spanje,\nEn nombre del Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a, >PIC FILE= \"T0016453\">"}
