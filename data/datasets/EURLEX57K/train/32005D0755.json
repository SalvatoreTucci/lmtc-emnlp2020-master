In order to safeguard both the Community and neighbouring third countries pending such destruction, tighter controls should be put in place to ensure that consignments, not fully complying with Community animal health rules, despatched from storage in the Community have the express consent of the third country of destination and of any third country of transit.\n(6) Decisions 2005/92/EC and 2005/93/EC should therefore be amended to only permit the movements of products covered by those Decisions to a third country of destination or transit through a third country, or to vessels acting as cross border sea transport, with the express written authorisation of the competent authority of those countries, or of a responsible officer on board the vessel.\n(7) It is appropriate to provide that the person responsible for the movements of the products concerned obtains and presents the necessary written authorisations to the competent authority of the Member State in which the products are stored, before the competent authority permits the exit of the products to the final destination or for transit to such destination.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/92/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the following Article 2a is inserted:\n(i) the competent authority of the third country of destination and of any third country of transit; or\n(ii) the responsible officer on the vessel being supplied.\u2019;\n2. in Article 3, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:", "Decision 2005/93/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the following Article 1a is inserted:\n2. in Article 2, the second paragraph is replaced by the following:", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 24, 30.1.1998, p. 9.
