These products are currently also available after other fermentations than composting, in particular anaerobic fermentation in view of biogas production. The amendments for these products are urgent in the light of the upcoming agricultural season during which these products could be used, under the restrictive requirements laid down in Annex I, part A, to the Regulation, for fertilising purposes. Anaerobic fermentation in view of biogas production is a process which in principle is in line with the environment protection objectives of organic farming.\n(3) It is necessary to correct in several languages the name of the product \"basic slag\" to cover the same product. It also appeared that this product was not edited in the Portuguese version of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2381/94(3), which established part A of Annex II. Therefore this omission has to be corrected.\n(4) The experience with the use of industrial lime from sugar production in organic farming has shown that it is appropriate to permit this use to continue after 31 March 2002.\n(5) Many preparations of pyrethrins extracted from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium contain piperonylbutoxide as synergist. Therefore it is appropriate to strengthen the conditions under which these preparations can be used.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply forthwith.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 March 2001.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 241, 26.9.2000, p. 39.\n(3) OJ L 255, 1.10.1994, p. 84.\nANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended as follows:\n1.
