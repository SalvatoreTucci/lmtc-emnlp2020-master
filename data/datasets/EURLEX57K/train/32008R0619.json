Commission Regulation (EC) No 1454/2007 of 10 December 2007 laying down common rules for establishing a tender procedure for fixing export refunds for certain agricultural products\u00a0(3) repeals Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 as from 1 July 2008.\n(3) In accordance with Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2007 a standing invitation to tender should be opened concerning the products covered by Article 1(1) of that Regulation. Since Regulation (EC) No 1454/2007 does not contain all the specific rules for the dairy sector included so far in Regulation (EC) No 580/2004, it is necessary to establish those rules from the date of repeal of that Regulation. For practical reasons and for sake of clarity and simplification, it is appropriate to provide for one single Regulation containing also the specific provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 581/2004 of 26 March 2004 opening a standing invitation to tender for export refunds concerning certain types of butter\u00a0(4) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 582/2004 of 26 March 2004 opening a standing invitation to tender for export refunds concerning skimmed milk powder\u00a0(5).\n(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 of 17 August 2006 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards export licences and export refunds for milk and milk products\u00a0(6), applies to all export licences and export refunds in the dairy sector. Licences issued in the context of the tender to be opened by this Regulation relate to specific products, it is therefore appropriate to lay down specific rules derogating from the general rules on export licences provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006. Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2007 provides for licences to be issued by the national authorities within five working days following the entry into force of the Commission's Decision fixing a maximum refund and lays down that the licence has to become valid on its actual day of issue. It is appropriate therefore to fix a validity period differently from that provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1282/2006 in order to ensure an equal period for all licences issued.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Scope\nA standing invitation to tender is opened in order to determine the export refund on the following milk products referred to in Section 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87\u00a0(7), guaranteeing equality of access for all persons established in the Community:\n(a) natural butter in blocks of at least 20 kilograms net weight falling under product code ex\u00a0ex 0405 10 19 9700;\n(b) butteroil in containers of at least 20 kilograms net weight falling under product code ex\u00a0ex 0405 90 10 9000;\n(c) skimmed milk powder in bags of at least 25 kilograms net weight and containing no more than 0,5\u00a0% by weight of added non-lactic matter falling under product code ex\u00a0ex 0402 10 19 9000.", "Destinations\nThe products referred to in Article 1 are intended for export for all destinations with the exception of:\n(a) third countries: Andorra, Liechtenstein, the United States of America and the Holy See (Vatican City State);\n(b) territories of the EU Member States not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: the Faer\u00f6e Islands, Greenland, Heligoland, Ceuta, Melilla, the Communes of Livigno and Campione d'Italia, and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control;\n(c) European territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible and not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Gibraltar.", "Applicable rules\nCommission Regulations (EC) No 1291/2000\u00a0(8), (EC) No 1282/2006 and (EC) No 1454/2007 shall apply save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "Submission of tenders\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders may only be lodged during tendering periods and shall be valid only for the tendering period in which they are lodged.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each tendering period shall begin at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the second Tuesday of the month with the following exceptions:\n(a) in August it shall begin at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the third Tuesday;\n(b) in December it shall begin at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the first Tuesday.\nIf Tuesday is a public holiday, the period shall begin at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the following working day.\nEach tendering period shall end at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the third Tuesday of the month with the following exceptions:\n(a) in August it shall end at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the fourth Tuesday;\n(b) in December it shall end at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the second Tuesday.\nIf Tuesday is a public holiday the period shall end at 13.00 (Brussels time) on the previous working day.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each tendering period shall be numbered in series starting with the first period provided for.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be submitted to the competent authorities of the Member States listed in Annex II.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tenders shall be submitted separately, by destination, for one of the product codes referred to in Article 1.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the requirement laid down in Article 3(5)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2007, a tender shall indicate in Section 16 of the licence application the export refund product code preceded by \u2018ex\u2019 as referred to in Article 1 to this Regulation.", "Application quantities\nFor the products referred to in Article 1 each tender shall cover a minimum quantity of at least 10 tonnes.", "Securities\nThe tendering security shall be 15\u00a0% of the most recent maximum tender refund amount fixed for the same product code and the same destination.
