As a consequence of the annulment of the duty, Rima was not subject to any anti-dumping duty at the time the review was opened.\n(7) The Council is therefore of the opinion that Rima should not be subject to any duty higher than the one imposed before the first review as, given that it did not export to the Community during the investigation period for the second review, it had  no reason to believe that circumstances concerning Rima had changed during the second review. The anti-dumping duty of 20,5 % imposed on Rima by Regulation (EC) No 3359/93 should therefore be repealed with effect from the date that Regulation entered  into force.\n(8) Since this Regulation does not modify or confirm the measures contained in Regulation (EC) No 3359/93 within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the date on which they were due to expire pursuant to that provision remains  unchanged,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping duty of 20,5 % imposed by Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3359/93 on imports of ferro-silicon originating in Brazil and produced by Cia Rima Electrometalurgia SA, Belo Horizonte, Brazil is hereby repealed.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply with effect from 10 December 1993.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 September 1994.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nTh.
