The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC takes account of Resolution No 20 \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Member Countries \u2014 adopted by the OIE in May 2013.\n(4) In May 2014, the OIE adopted Resolution No 18 \u2014 Recognition of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Status of Member Countries\u00a0(3). In addition to the Member States already listed in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC, that Resolution recognised Bulgaria, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia as having a negligible BSE risk.\n(5) In June 2014, the OIE suspended\u00a0(4) the negligible BSE risk status for Romania, with effect from 27 June 2014, following a report received from the OIE Delegate of Romania on the detection of a BSE case in Romania.\n(6) The list in the Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended to be brought into line with the Resolution No 18 adopted by the OIE in May 2014 and to take account of the subsequent OIE decision to suspend the negligible BSE risk status for Romania.\n(7) Decision 2007/453/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2007/453/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 October 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0147, 31.5.2001, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2007/453/EC of 29 June 2007 establishing the BSE status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof according to their BSE risk (OJ L\u00a0172, 30.6.2007, p.\u00a084).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/2014_A_RESO-18_BSE.pdf\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/lossreinstatement-of-status/\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nLIST OF COUNTRIES OR REGIONS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a negligible BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 Belgium\n\u2014 Bulgaria\n\u2014 Croatia\n\u2014 Denmark\n\u2014 Estonia\n\u2014 Hungary\n\u2014 Italy\n\u2014 Latvia\n\u2014 Luxembourg\n\u2014 Malta\n\u2014 Netherlands\n\u2014 Portugal\n\u2014 Austria\n\u2014 Slovenia\n\u2014 Slovakia\n\u2014 Finland\n\u2014 Sweden\nEuropean Free Trade Association countries\n\u2014 Iceland\n\u2014 Norway\nThird countries\n\u2014 Argentina\n\u2014 Australia\n\u2014 Brazil\n\u2014 Chile\n\u2014 Colombia\n\u2014 India\n\u2014 Israel\n\u2014 Japan\n\u2014 New Zealand\n\u2014 Panama\n\u2014 Paraguay\n\u2014 Peru\n\u2014 Singapore\n\u2014 United States\n\u2014 Uruguay\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with a controlled BSE risk\nMember States\n\u2014 the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Cyprus, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, United Kingdom\nEuropean Free Trade Association countries\n\u2014 Liechtenstein\n\u2014 Switzerland\nThird countries\n\u2014 Canada\n\u2014 Costa Rica\n\u2014 Mexico\n\u2014 Nicaragua\n\u2014 South Korea\n\u2014 Taiwan\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Countries or regions with an undetermined BSE risk\n\u2014 Countries or regions not listed in points A or B.\u2019"}
