The letter given in the code for the indicators refers to the relevant annex of Regulation (EC) No 1165/98.\nThe second column indicates whether a derogation is needed. If one is not needed, \"none\" is recorded; if one is needed, it is indicated as \"complete\" or \"partial\". If a complete derogation is needed for a particular indicator, this indicates that no data is available for that indicator. If a partial derogation is needed, some information will be available, although this will not be in accordance with all of the provisions of the Regulation. The remaining columns in the table indicate for the partial derogations which particular aspect of the requirements for that indicator can not be met. These may be that the indicator will be (i) late (extra time needed), (ii) calculated less frequently than required (frequency), (iii) incomplete in its activity coverage (activities not covered), (iv) not available for all levels of activity breakdowns required (lack of activity detail), (v) not available for all construction breakdowns (lack of CC detail - only relevant for Annex B indicators) or (vi) other reasons.\nWith respect to deadlines, the Regulation provides for an extra 15 calendar days in the transmission deadline for countries with value added below a certain threshold. Derogations for extended deadlines in the tables below refer to extensions beyond this 15-day extension.\nOne final column is provided in the tables to indicate the expected ending date of the derogations. The dates given in this column normally refer to the first reference period for which data will be sent without the derogation. As such, the first transmission of such data may be several months thereafter.\n1.1. General derogation - relevant for all countries\nFor indicators B 411 and B 412, the indexes may be calculated directly from the number of permits rather than from kind-of-activity units.\nThe requested country derogations are presented in the following sequence: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom.\n1.
