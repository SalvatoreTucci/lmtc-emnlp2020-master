Inserting a reference to natural products in the definition of scheduled substance should resolve this discrepancy and therefore allow controls to be applied to sassafras oil. Only natural products from which scheduled substances can be easily extracted should be covered by the definition.\n(3) The establishment of a cooperation procedure is foreseen in the European Union's anti-drug action plan, approved by the Santa Maria da Feira European Council on 19 and 20 June 2000. To underpin cooperation between the authorities of the Member States and the chemical industry, in particular as regards substances which, although not covered by the rules on precursors, may be used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs, the Commission should be given responsibility for drawing up guidelines to assist that industry.\n(4) The provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 concerning the committee procedure should be amended to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(2).\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 is amended as follows:\n1.

The guidelines shall provide, in particular:\n(a) information on how to recognise and notify suspect transactions;\n(b) a regularly updated list of non-scheduled substances commonly used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, to enable the industry to monitor on a voluntary basis the trade in such substances;\n(c) other information which may be deemed useful.\n3.
