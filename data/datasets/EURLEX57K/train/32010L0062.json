Therefore, Council Directive 80/720/EEC of 24 June 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors\u00a0(2), Directive\u00a02003/37/EC, Directive 2009/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the maximum design speed of and load platforms for wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors\u00a0(3) and Directive 2009/144/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on certain components and characteristics of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors\u00a0(4) should be amended to take account of the specificities of low-clearance tractors.\n(2) In order to progress in the completion of the internal market and to achieve higher levels of occupational safety, requirements for front power take-offs for all tractor categories covered by Directive 2003/37/EC should be included in Council Directive\u00a086/297/EEC of 26 May 1986 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the power take-offs of wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors and their protection\u00a0(5).\n(3) The required clearance zones and dimensions of the power take-off protective guard established in Directive 86/297/EEC should be amended in order to achieve worldwide harmonisation of such zones and dimensions so as to facilitate the global competitiveness of Union manufacturers.\n(4) ISO 500-1:2004 together with the Technical Corrigendum 1:2005, ISO 500-2:2004, and ISO 8759-1:1998 contain globally recognised requirements for power take-offs of all tractors covered by Directive 2003/37/EC. It is therefore appropriate to make reference to those ISO standards in Directive 86/297/EEC.\n(5) Directive 2003/37/EC should be amended in order to reflect the application of Directive 86/297/EEC to tractors of category T5. Equally, Directive 2003/37/EC should be amended to reflect the application of Directive 2009/60/EC and Directive\u00a080/720/EEC to tractors of category T4.3.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,", "main_body": ["Directive 80/720/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
