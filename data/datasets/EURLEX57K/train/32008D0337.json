Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004, the first means of identification of those animals is eartags. The second means of identification includes the electronic identification of ovine and caprine animals.\n(2) Commission Decision 2006/968/EC\u00a0(2) sets out guidelines and procedures for the approval of identifiers and readers for the electronic identification of ovine and caprine animals pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004.

Those tests are to be carried out by designated test laboratories that operate and are assessed and accredited in accordance with certain European standards.\n(3) Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules\u00a0(3) refers to those European standards in relation to the designation by competent authorities of official laboratories.\n(4) It is appropriate to amend the reference in Decision 2006/968/EC to those standards in order to take into account the specific character of the test laboratories referred to in that Decision.\n(5) Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004, (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004\u00a0(4) provides for a derogation from Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
