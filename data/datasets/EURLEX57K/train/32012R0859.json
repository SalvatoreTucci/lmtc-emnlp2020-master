Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\u00a0(3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption\u00a0(4).\n(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 534/2012\u00a0(5). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.\n(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(7) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of
