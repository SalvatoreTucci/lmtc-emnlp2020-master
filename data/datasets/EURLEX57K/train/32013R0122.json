This may be the result, inter alia, of different modes of actions, different pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles, different lengths of treatment or different routes of administration.\n(4) Substances listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin\u00a0(4) should not appear on the list of essential substances and substances bringing added clinical benefit. Therefore, it is necessary to amend the list in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 to remove from that list any substances listed in Regulation (EU) No 37/2010.\n(5) It is also appropriate to remove from the list in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 several substances identified as alternatives to the substances listed, which are not available for the treatment of horses because they are not listed as \u2018essential substances\u2019 or \u2018substances bringing added clinical benefit\u2019 under Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 nor listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010.\n(6) Due to changes in Union legislation since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006, the references in that Regulation to the relevant legislation on control mechanisms for equidae and on maximum residue limits should be updated.\n(7) The amended list set out in the Annex to this Regulation has been subject to a scientific evaluation carried out by the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5).\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 should be amended accordingly.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 is amended as follows:\n(1) the title of Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 is replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n(3) in Article 2, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n(4) Articles 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\n(5) in Article 5, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(6) the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 367, 22.12.2006, p. 33.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 149, 7.6.2008, p. 3.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 15, 20.1.2010, p. 1.\u2019;\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nList of substances essential for the treatment of equidae and substances bringing added clinical benefit compared to other treatment options available for equidae\nThe withdrawal period for each of the substances on the following list shall be six months.\nIndication Active substance Justification and explanation of use\nAnaesthetics, analgesics and substances used in association with anaesthesia\nSedation and premedication Acepromazine Purpose: premedication prior to general anaesthesia, mild sedation.\nAtipamezole Purpose: \u03b1-2 adrenoceptor antagonist used for reversal of \u03b1-2 agonists.\nDiazepam Purpose: premedication and induction of anaesthesia.
