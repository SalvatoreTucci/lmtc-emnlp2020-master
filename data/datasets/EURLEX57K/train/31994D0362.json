Point 3 of Part 2 of Annex I is replaced by the following:\n'3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 53,41 - 0,786 x1 + 0,266 x2\nwhere\n^y = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x1.\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 40 and 100 kilograms.`\n4. Point 3 of Part 3 of Annex I is replaced by the following:\n'3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n^y = 67,57 - 0,459 x1 - 0,310 x2\nwhere\n^y = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx1 = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcase between the third and fourth last ribs,\nx2 = the minimum thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured on the midline of the split carcase covering the lumbar muscle (M. glutaeus medius).\nThis formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 40 and 100 kilograms.`\n5.
