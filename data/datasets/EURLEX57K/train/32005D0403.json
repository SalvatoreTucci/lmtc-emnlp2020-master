Those documents have been published as the \u2018Communication of the Commission with regard to the interpretative documents of Council Directive 89/106/EEC\u2019\u00a0(2).\n(2) With respect to the essential requirement of safety in the event of fire, interpretative document No 2 lists a number of interrelated measures which together define the fire safety strategy to be developed in different ways in the Member States.\n(3) Interpretative document No 2 identifies the requirements for construction products for roofs exposed to an external fire.\n(4) By way of a harmonised solution, a system of classes was adopted in Commission Decision 2001/671/EC of 21 August 2001 implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards the classification of external fire performance of roofs and roof coverings\u00a0(3).\n(5) In the case of certain plastisol coated steel roof sheets, it is necessary to use the classification established in Decision 2001/671/EC.\n(6) The external fire performance of many construction products and/or materials, within the classification provided for in Decision 2001/671/EC, is well established and sufficiently well known to fire regulators in Member States with the consequence that they do not require testing for this particular performance characteristic.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,", "main_body": ["The construction products and/or materials which satisfy all the requirements of the performance characteristic \u2018external fire performance\u2019 without need for further testing are set out in the Annex.", "The specific classes to be applied to different construction products and/or materials, within the external fire performance classification adopted in Decision 2001/671/EC, are set out in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 25 May 2005.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12.
