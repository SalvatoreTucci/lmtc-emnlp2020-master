Consequently, under Article 10 of the Decision, the Commission must determine whether the measures are compatible with the objectives and criteria laid down in the Decision and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nII\nThe restructuring programme under way in the United Kingdom has brought about a marked improvement in the productivity and competitiveness of the coal industry. Over the last few years the amount of aid granted to the appreciably. industry in the United Kingdom has been reduced apreciably. The aid covered by this Decision has been reduced by almost 40 % since 1985/86.\nThe aid for occupational and geographical redeployment of workers is a specific measure independent of aid pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC. It is therefore compatible with Article 6 of the Decision.\nThe aim of the aid is to maintain a skilled workforce in the coal industry within the framework of the restructuring programme.\nSince the measure is temporary and forms part of the programme to restructure the industry, it satisfies the objectives and conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Decision.\nIn the light of the foregoing, the aid which the United Kingdom Government plans to grant to the United Kingdom coal industry for current production in 1989 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nThis Decision applies without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of arrangements or agreements governing sales of coal mined in the United Kingdom to electricity producers.\nIII\nPursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof. The Commission must therefore be informed of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,", "main_body": ["The United Kingdom is hereby authorized to grant for the 1988/89 financial year, with effect from 1 April 1989:\naid totalling \u00a3 15 500 000 for occupational and geographical redeployment of workers.", "The United Kingdom Government shall inform the Commission by 30 June 1990 of the amounts actually paid in the 1989/90 financial year.", "This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 July 1989.\nFor the Commission\nAnt\u00f3nio CARDOSO E CUNHA\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1."}
