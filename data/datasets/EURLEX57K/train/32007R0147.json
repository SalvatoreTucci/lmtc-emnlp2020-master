In order to avoid a disproportionate impact of deductions it is necessary to apply a correction factor to the quantities to be deducted from mackerel quotas in respect of amounts overfished from 2001 to 2004.\n(8) The additional quantity of mackerel fished in excess by the UK in 2005 should be deducted from the UK's 2007 quota.\n(9) The deduction scheme will be compatible with scientific advice since the total allowable catches for mackerel and herring in coming years will be based on scientific advice which will take into account the adjusted catches resulting from reduced quotas.\n(10) The correction factor should equate to the 2006 total allowable catch for mackerel expressed as a percentage of the average total allowable catch for the years 2001 to 2004.\n(11) Additionally, in order to avoid adverse social and economic consequences, the quantities deducted in any one year should not exceed a percentage of the annual quota. It is appropriate to fix this percentage at 15\u00a0%.\n(12) In a case where the quantity to be deducted in any one year exceeds 15\u00a0% of the annual quota, the deduction period will be extended to reduce the quantity equal to or below 15\u00a0%.\n(13) Taking account of the request of the Member States concerned to have a smaller amount deducted from certain quotas in 2007 than in the following years from 2008 to 2012.\n(14) The Committee for fisheries and Aquaculture has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and herring (Clupea harengus) quotas allocated to Ireland and the United Kingdom in the years from 2007 to 2012 shall be reduced as shown in Annex I and Annex\u00a0II.", "The quantities deducted in any one year shall not exceed 15\u00a0% of the annual quota.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 15 February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Council Regulation (EC) No 2848/2000 (OJ L 334, 30.12.2000, p. 1); Council Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 (OJ L 347, 31.12.2001, p. 1); Council Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 (OJ L 356, 31.12.2002, p. 12); Council Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 (OJ L 344, 31.12.2003, p. 1); Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 (OJ L 12, 14.1.2005, p. 1).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) No 742/2006 (OJ L 130, 18.5.2006, p. 7).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3.\nANNEX I\nQUOTA DEDUCTIONS 2007-2012\nCountry Species Stock code Zone 2001-2004 overfish Correction factor Total deduction 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nUK Mackerel 2CX14 II (non-EC waters), Vb (EC waters), VI, VII, VIIIa, b, d, e, XII, XIV 112\u00a0546 0,734 82\u00a0609 12\u00a0391,3 14\u00a0043,5 14\u00a0043,5 14\u00a0043,5 14\u00a0043,5 14\u00a0043,5\nUK Herring 5B6ANB Vb, VIaN (EC waters), VIb 10\u00a0349 n.r. 10\u00a0349 1\u00a0552,4 1\u00a0759,3 1\u00a0759,3 1\u00a0759,3 1\u00a0759,3 1\u00a0759,3\nUK Herring 4AB IV north of 53\u00b0 30\u2032 N 33\u00a0485 n.r. 33\u00a0485 5\u00a0022,8 5\u00a0692,5 5\u00a0692,5 5\u00a0692,5 5\u00a0692,5 5\u00a0692,5\nUK Herring 1/2 I, II (EC waters and International waters) HER/1/2 127 n.r. 127 127 0 0 0 0 0\nIE Mackerel 2CX14 II (non-EC waters), Vb (EC waters), VI, VII, VIIIa, b, d, e, XII, XIV 33\u00a0486 0,734 24\u00a0578,7 3\u00a0686,8 4\u00a0178,4 4\u00a0178,4 4\u00a0178,4 4\u00a0178,4 4\u00a0178,4\nANNEX II\nQUOTA DEDUCTIONS 2007-2012\nCountry Species Stock code Zone 2005 overfish Correction factor Total deduction 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nUK Mackerel 2CX14 II (non-EC waters), Vb (EC waters), VI, VII, VIIIa, b, d, e, XII, XIV 5\u00a0090 n.r. 5\u00a0090 5\u00a0090 0 0 0 0 0"}
