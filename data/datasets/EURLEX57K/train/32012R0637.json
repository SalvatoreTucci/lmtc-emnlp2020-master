Since the replacement of Directive 91/414/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, these substances are deemed to have been approved under that Regulation and are listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances\u00a0(5).\n(2) In accordance with Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019, presented to the Commission its views on the draft review reports for iron sulphate\u00a0(6), repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude\u00a0(7) and repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil pitch\u00a0(8) on 16 December 2011. The draft review reports and the views of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 1 June 2012 in the format of the Commission review reports for iron sulphate, repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude and repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil pitch.\n(3) The Authority communicated its views on iron sulphate, repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude and repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil pitch to the notifiers, and the Commission invited them to submit comments on the review reports.\n(4) It is confirmed that the active substances iron sulphate, repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude and repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil pitch are to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n(5) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to amend the conditions of approval of iron sulphate, repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude and repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil pitch. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information as regards those active substances.\n(6) The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) A reasonable period of time should be allowed before the application of this Regulation in order to allow Member States, notifiers and holders of authorisations for plant protection products to meet the requirements resulting from amendment to the conditions of the approval.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing repellents by smell of animal or plant origin/tall oil crude as active substances in order to comply with the Annex to this Regulation by 1 May 2013.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 November 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 July 2012.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 344, 20.12.2008, p. 89.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 379, 24.12.2004, p.13.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance iron sulfate.
