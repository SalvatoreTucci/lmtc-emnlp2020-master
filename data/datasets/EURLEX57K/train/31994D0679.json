It shall review implementation of the programme and, where appopriate, propose  any adjustments required.\n2. The committee shall establish its own internal procedures within three months of its establishment.\n3.

By continuous monitoring is meant an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the operational programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators  structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realization.\n3. Continuous assessment of an operational programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and  programme objectives.\nImplementation report and scrutiny of operational programmes\n4. France shall notify to the Commission, within three months of adoption of the operational programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the annual implementation report. Within three months of its appointment  this authority shall present to the Commission a proposal for standard presentation of implementation reports.\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact should be made  on the basis of the indicators agreed.\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission and to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 31 December 1995 at the latest.\n5. The Commission may jointly with France call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or  measures, modification of the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the admimistrative measures to be taken.  To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will not pay the entire cost of employing him.\nC. Information and publicity\nIn the framework of this action, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicised.\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n- make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\nFrance and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the monitoring committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures adopted,  either by an annual report or through the monitoring committee.\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\nII. COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES  Community policies applying in this field must be complied with.\nThe operational programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and compliance with Community policies. The following information must be supplied by France.\n1. Award of public contracts\nThe 'public contracts' (1) questionnaire must be completed for:\n- public contracts above the ceilings set by the 'supplies' and 'works' directives that are awarded by contract-awarding authorities as defined in these directives and are not covered by the exemptions specified therein,\n- public contracts below these ceilings where they constitute components of a single piece of work or of uniform supplies of a value above the ceiling.
