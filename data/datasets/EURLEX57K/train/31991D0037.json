whereas it is well known that varieties of maize with an FAO maturity class index over 350 are not at present  suitable for cultivation in Germany (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of Directive 70/457/EEC); whereas, therefore, the application of Germany in respect of these varieties should be granted in full;\nWhereas the application of Greece concerns early varieties of soya bean; whereas it is also well known that early varieties of soya bean are not at present suitable for cultivation in Greece (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of Directive 70/457/EEC);  whereas, therefore, the application of Greece in respect of these varieties should be granted in full;\nWhereas, however, the system for the grant of authorizations pursuant to Article 15 (2) of the said Directive must be revised, with a view to the completion of the internal market; whereas this revision will affect all derogations granted hitherto, with  effect from 31 December 1992 at the latest;\nWhereas by the abovementioned Decisions the Commission has authorized Germany inter alia to prohibit the marketing of seed of certain varieties of oats of the winter type and of certain varieties of maize with an FAO maturity class index over 350,  listed in the then current common catalogues of agricultural plant species;\nWhereas experience has shown that it can no longer be maintained that in Germany the value for cultivation and use of certain varieties of oats of the winter type is inferior to other comparable varieties;\nWhereas in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge certain varieties of maize which in the past were considered to fall into a FAO maturity class of an index higher than the abovementioned FAO maturity class index can no longer be so  considered;\nWhereas the conditions necessitating the grant of such authorizations to Germany in respect of the said varieties of oats of the winter type and maize are therefore no longer satisfied;\nWhereas accordingly such authorizations in respect of the said varieties should be withdrawn;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nThe Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorized to prohibit the marketing in its territory of the following varieties to be listed in the 1991 common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species:\nCEREALS\nZea mays L. - maize\nAcheo\nAE 431\nAida\nAlbax (W)\nAlcober\nAlfan  Aliber\nAlidile\nAligris\nAlimir\nAlios\nAlnus PX 9646  Alver\nAlyson\nAmalia\nAmandis\nAmor\nArdy\nAriane\nArider\nAriete\nArio\nAtakant\nAthenea\nAxion\nAzuris\nBadajoz\nBarcellona\nBellum\nBilitis\nBlancor (W)\nBleck\nBolt\nBomber\nBondy\nCalvi 2659\nCapitan\nCardan\nCargispor\nCarico\nCelina\nCeltis\nCiclone\nCifor 4313\nClara 2655\nCometa\nCommandos\nConte\nCoronado\nCorsar\nCreso\nCruise\nCS 8671\nCusco\nDaino\nDakar G-4590\nDekas\nDekor\nDekalb XL 72-3\nDenni\nDingo\nDiodo\nDiscovery\nDivina (W)\nDixie\nDK 415\nDK 433\nDK 536\nDK 698\nDoge\nDole\nDracma G-4662\nDrive\nDucato G-4712\nDuplex\nDuplo\nElegans  Emily\nEurodis\nEvery\nExpress\nFabio\nFaro\nFausto\nFeeling 02\nFiorino G-4440\nFlax\nFrederik\nFuji (W)\nFulton\nFurio 4207\nFuturo\nGalaxis\nGary\nGiovanna\nGlauco\nGordon\nGranada\nGreat\nGreg\nHawaiano\nHercule 2638\nIbernio\nIller\nIllinois DK 698\nIonio (Wx)\nItala\nJedi\nJuly\nKido 2641\nKuban\nLady\nLancial\nLaser\nLavinia\nLeone\nLG 2520\nLicinio\nLitio\nLola (x)\nLook\nLord\nLoriot (Wx)\nLos Angeles\nMarkober\nMasko\nMilan\nMilford\nMirto\nMoana\nMolto\nMorgan\nNC 3440\nNC 6131\nNatali\nNavajo\nNelson\nNew York\nNorman\nOdiseo\nOlympis\nOrchidea  Orionus (Wx)\nOvalis\nPamela\nPasadena\nPascal\nPeonia\nPlauto\nPlutonio\nPothos\nProfessional\nPublio\nPX 9283\nPX 9540\nRegen\nReno\nRing\nRiver\nRoger\nRoll\nRosai\nRoxalis\nRoxis\nRunner\nSally\nSan Diego\nSandy  Scorpio\nScott\nSierra\nSilka\nSimona\nSirmio\nSpencer\nSpiritis\nSprea\nSprint\nSting\nStratos\nSwan (Wx)\nTauro\nTerry\nTexano\nTiffany\nTosca\nUlis\nUrasis\nValdivia\nVandy\nVentotene\nZack\nZannone.", "The Hellenic Republic is hereby authorized to prohibit the marketing in its territory of seed of the following varieties to be listed in the 1991 common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species:\nOIL AND FIBRE PLANTS\nGlycine max.
