whereas eligibility for such quota is subject to conditions to be determined by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination; whereas, in an Exchange of Letters with Austria dated 21 July 1972, the Community undertook unilaterally to increase the size of the tariff quota from 20 000 to 30 000 head and to lower the quota duty from 6 to 4 %; whereas, subsequently, this quota was increased unilaterally to 38 000 head;\nWhereas according to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters of 14 July 1986, which was adopted by Decision 86/555/EEC (1), the volume of this tariff quota was raised to 42 600 head as from 1 July 1986; whereas the abovementioned tariff quota for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 should therefore be opened at a duty of 4 % in relation to a quantity of 42 600 head; whereas, however, under the terms of Article 282 of the 1985 Act of Accession, the Portuguese Republic is authorized to postpone, until the beginning of the second stage, the progressive application to imports of preferences granted, unilaterally or by agreement, by the Community to certain third countries;\nWhereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and continuous access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and the uninterrupted application of the quota duties, to all imports of the animals in question until the quota is exhausted; whereas, having regard to the principles defined above, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas possibilities for the use of such mountain breeds are, however, limited by special factors, both geographical and zootechnical; whereas certain Member States do not have regions suitable for breeding this kind of cattle; whereas, however, in view of such special factors, the Community nature of the tariff quota in question should be preserved by making provision for requirements which may arise in these Member States; whereas, to this end, these Member States proceed to draw adequate shares from the Community reserve which has been set up; whereas, in order to reflect as closely as possible the actual trend of the market in question, the initial allocation must be made in proportion to the requirements of each of the Member States concerned, calculated in accordance with statistical data concerning imports from third countries during a representative reference period and with economic prospects for the quota period in question;\nWhereas, since the animals in question belong to certain specific breeds which are not specified as such in the statistical nomenclatures of the Member States, no data on imports provided by the Member States could be considered to be sufficiently accurate and representative to be used as a basis for the allocation in question; whereas the extent to which Community tariff quotas for those animals in the Community have been exhausted and the estimates made by certain Member States enable the requirements of each of them as regards imports from third countries for the quota period envisaged to be assessed as follows:\nGermany 20 000 head\nFrance 1 800 head\nItaly 16 000 head\nGreece 3 000 head;\nwhereas in the absence of precise information, the needs of the Benelux countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain may be assessed at 100, 50, 50 and 100 head respectively;\nWhereas, in order to take into account the possible trend of imports of the aforementioned animals into the said Member States, the quota amount of 42 600 head should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States, the second forming a reserve intended subsequently to cover the requirements of those Member States when their initial shares are exhausted and requirements which arise within other Member States; whereas, in order to ensure a certain degree of security for importers in the aforementioned Member States, the first part of the Community quota should be determined at a level which, under the present circumstances, may be approximately 76 % of the quota amount;\nWhereas the initial shares of those Member States may be used up more or less rapidly; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, it is important that the Member States having used up almost the whole of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each of these Member States as and when each of its additional shares is almost entirely used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be available until the end of the quota period; whereas such method of administration calls for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission, which latter must, in particular, be able to observe the extent to which the quota are used and inform Member States thereof;\nWhereas if, at a specified date within the quota period, a considerable balance of the initial share of one or other of the Member States is left over, it is essential that that State should return a considerable part of such balance to the reserve in order that part of the Community tariff quota should not remain unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;\nWhereas it is possible that, during the period of applicability of the said quota, the nomenclature used by the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System;\nWhereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,", "main_body": ["1.
