Through that measure, those taxable persons would be exempted from all or some of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n(2) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 13 September 2012 of the request made by Belgium. By letter dated 17 September 2012, the Commission notified Belgium that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.\n(3) Under Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Member States, which have not made use of Article 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC of 11 April 1967 on the harmonisation of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes, structure and procedures for application of the common system of value added tax\u00a0(2), may exempt taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 5\u00a0000. Belgium has requested that this threshold be increased to EUR 25\u00a0000.\n(4) A higher threshold for the special scheme for small enterprises is a simplification measure in that it may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of the smallest businesses. The special scheme is optional for taxable persons.\n(5) In its proposal of 29 October 2004 for a Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC, now Directive 2006/112/EC, with a view to simplifying valued added tax obligations, the Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100\u00a0000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that amount each year. The request submitted by Belgium is in line with that proposal.\n(6) The derogating measure will have only a negligible effect on the overall amount of the tax revenue of Belgium collected at the stage of final consumption and will have no adverse impact on the Union\u2019s own resources accruing from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Kingdom of Belgium is authorised to exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25\u00a0000.\nThe Kingdom of Belgium may raise that ceiling in order to maintain the value of the exemption in real terms.", "This Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2013 until the date of entry into force of a Directive amending the amounts of the annual turnover ceilings below which taxable persons may qualify for VAT exemption or until 31 December 2015, whichever date is earlier.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 January 2013.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.
