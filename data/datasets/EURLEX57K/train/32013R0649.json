The necessary rapid field visits of those parcels in high altitude have been delayed by heavy and late-season snowfalls. Consequently, farmers intending to submit a single application relating to agricultural parcels of alpine pastures will be provided with the updated information about the parcels later than foreseen.\n(8) This situation has affected the ability of applicants to submit single aid applications and payment claims relating to agricultural parcels of alpine pastures in Austria within the time limits provided for in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 and Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011.\n(9) Due to those difficulties, the application process in 2013 is expected to start later than the date on which the process started in the previous years for farmers with agricultural parcels of alpine pastures. The information submitted by the Austrian authorities to the Commission on their capacity to finalise the update of the LPIS for those areas shows that a derogation until 28 June 2013 is necessary to enable all farmers and beneficiaries concerned to submit their single applications.\n(10) By way of derogation from Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 it is therefore appropriate not to apply reductions on grounds of late submission of single applications in respect of those farmers who submitted their single applications relating to at least one agricultural parcel of alpine pasture as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 by 28 June 2013 at the latest.\n(11) Similarly, by way of derogation from Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 and in respect of payment claims under Title I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 relating to at least one agricultural parcel of alpine pastures as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, it is appropriate not to apply reductions on grounds of late submission of payment claims which were submitted by 28 June 2013 at the latest.\n(12) Since the derogations should cover the single applications and payment claims submitted for aid year 2013, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies retroactively.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Rural Development Committee and the Management Committee for Direct Payments,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009, in respect of the application year 2013, no reductions on grounds of late submission shall apply to those farmers who submitted a single application relating to at least one agricultural parcel located in alpine pastures as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 by 28 June 2013 at the latest.
