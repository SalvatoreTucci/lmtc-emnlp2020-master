Official veterinarians and their staff are no longer required to keep other registers or records on those imports. Decision 94/360/EC should be amended to avoid duplication of effort as regards the recording of certain data in border inspection posts.\n(3) Council Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of 4 April 2002 on the conclusion of seven Agreements with the Swiss Confederation\u00a0(4) approves, among others, an Agreement on trade in agricultural products. Frequencies for the checks of certain animal products at border inspection posts are set out in Appendix 10 of Annex\u00a011 to that Agreement. Annex II to Decision 94/360/EC should be updated to make a reference to those provisions.\n(4) Council Decision 2002/979/EC of 18 November 2002 on the signature and provisional application of certain provisions of an Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part\u00a0(5) approves that Association Agreement. Frequencies for the checks of certain animal products at border inspection posts are set out in the provisions of that Association Agreement. Annex II to Decision 94/360/EC should be updated to make a reference to those provisions.\n(5) Commission Decision 2001/812/EC of 21 November 2001 laying down the requirements for the approval of border inspection posts responsible for veterinary checks on products introduced into the Community from third countries\u00a0(6) provides for the operations of border inspection posts in accordance with Directive 97/78/EC.\n(6) At the same time some adjustments to the text of 2001/812/EC are necessary in the light of experience to facilitate trade in certain animal by products to permit greater flexibility in the handling of products falling under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption\u00a0(7).\n(7) Consignments of certain small volume perishable blood and blood products of animal origin destined for technical or pharmaceutical use that are transported deep frozen or chilled in small hermetically sealed containers externally at ambient temperatures should be handled and checked in border inspection posts with facilities approved for handling only consignments at ambient temperatures.\n(8) At present there is a requirement for additional facilities in a border inspection post if the throughput of consignments rises above the figure of 500 per year, but this figure is not based upon risk and this absolute cut-off point should be replaced by a more appropriate system based upon an assessment by the competent authority of the Member State concerned, of the risk associated with handling of different categories of product in the same facility where one or other category of product is in fact only physically handled and checked on infrequent occasions.\n(9) The throughput figure of 500 consignments per year of products should nevertheless be taken as an indicative figure above which additional facilities will be required in a border inspection post unless an objective assessment by the competent authority of the different types of product being handled in the one location shows that additional facilities are not justified on the basis of possible cross contamination or risk to health.\n(10) The risk assessment and the basis of the justification for the action taken by the competent authority in any relevant border inspection post shall be notified to the Commission.\n(11) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Decision 94/360/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
