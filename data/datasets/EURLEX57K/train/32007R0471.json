It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01043/2005 and in Article 1(1) and in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0318/2006, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No\u00a0318/2006, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 27 April 2007.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 April 2007.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 58, 28.2.2006, p. 1.
