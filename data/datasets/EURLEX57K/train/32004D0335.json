Furthermore, the SCF, in its opinion on applications for approval of a variety of plant sterol enriched foods of 5 March 2003, came to the conclusion that the addition of phytosterols is safe, provided that the daily consumption does not exceed 3g.\n(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 608/2004 of 31 March 2004 concerning the labelling of foods and food ingredients with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters(2), phytostanols and/or phytostanol esters ensures that consumers receive the information necessary in order to avoid excessive intake of additional phytosterols.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Foods and food ingredients as described in Annex 1 with added phytosterol esters as specified in Annex 2, hereinafter called the products, may be placed on the market in the Community.", "The products shall be presented in such a manner that they can be easily divided into portions that contain either a maximum of 3g (in case of one portion per day) or a maximum of 1g (in case of three portions per day) of added phytosterol esters (calculated as free sterols/stanols).\nThe amount of phytosterols/phytostanols added to a container of beverages shall not exceed 3 g.", "This Decision is addressed to Unilever, London Road, Purfleet, Essex RM19 1SD, United Kingdom."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 31 March 2004.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 97, 1.4.2004, p. 44.\nANNEX 1\nProducts referred to in Article 1\nMilk type products, such as semi-skimmed and skimmed milk type products, yoghurt type products, and milk/yoghurt type products where the milk fat has been partly or fully replaced by vegetable fat.\nANNEX 2\nSpecifications of phytosterols and phytostanols for the addition to foods and food ingredients\nDefinition:\nPhytosterols and phytostanols are sterols and stanols that are extracted from plants and may be presented as free sterols and stanols or esterified with food grade fatty acids.\nComposition (with GC-FID or equivalent method):\n&lt;  80 % \u00e2-sitosterol\n&lt;  15 % \u00e2-sitostanol\n&lt;  40 % campesterol\n&lt;  5 % campestanol\n&lt;  30 % stigmasterol\n&lt;  3 % brassicasterol\n&lt;  3 % other sterols/stanols\nContamination/Purity (GC-FID or equivalent method)\nPhytosterols and phytostanols extracted from sources other than vegetable oil suitable for food have to be free of contaminants, best ensured by a purity of more than 99 % of the phytosterol/phytostanol ingredient."}
