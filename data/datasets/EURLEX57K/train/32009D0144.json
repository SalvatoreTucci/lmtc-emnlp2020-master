As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law form the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 19\u00a0February\u00a02002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article\u00a096 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a096(2)(c) of that Agreement.\nBy letters of 19\u00a0February\u00a02003, 19\u00a0February\u00a02004, 18\u00a0February\u00a02005, 15\u00a0February\u00a02006, 21\u00a0February\u00a02007 and 19\u00a0February\u00a02008, the European Union informed you of its decisions not to revoke the \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 and to extend the period of application until 20\u00a0February\u00a02004, 20\u00a0February\u00a02005, 20\u00a0February\u00a02006, 20\u00a0February\u00a02007, 20\u00a0February\u00a02008 and 20\u00a0February\u00a02009 respectively.\nThe European Union welcomes that, under the guidance of SADC, an agreement has been reached in Zimbabwe between the parties. It hopes that the new government will demonstrate its commitment to reform, including with respect to the rule of law, human rights and democratisation.\nNevertheless 12\u00a0months after the adoption of the latest decision on appropriate measures, the European Union considers that no significant progress has been made in the five areas referred to in the Council Decision of 18\u00a0February\u00a02002.\nIn the light of the above, the European Union does not consider that the appropriate measures can yet be revoked and has decided to extend their period of application until 20\u00a0February\u00a02010 pending reopening of consultations.\nThe European Union would once again emphasise that it is not penalising the Zimbabwean people and that it will continue its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support of the population, in particular projects in the social sectors, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are not affected by these measures.\nThe European Union wishes to reiterate that the application of appropriate measures within the meaning of Article\u00a096 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is no obstacle to political dialogue as provided for in Article\u00a08 of that Agreement.\nWith this in mind, the European Union wishes to underline once again the importance that it attaches to future EC-Zimbabwe cooperation and to confirm its willingness to carry on the dialogue and make progress in the near future towards a situation where the resumption of full cooperation becomes possible.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council"}
