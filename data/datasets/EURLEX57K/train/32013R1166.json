In order to minimise the exposure of birds and mammals, it is, however, appropriate to further restrict the uses of this active substance and to provide for specific risk mitigation measures for the protection of those species.\n(9) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) Member States should be provided with time to withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing dichlorprop-P.\n(11) For plant protection products containing dichlorprop-P, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should, at the latest, expire one year after the withdrawal or the amendment of the respective authorisations.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\nPart A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Transitional measures\nMember States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing dichlorprop-P as active substance by 9 June 2014.", "Period of grace\nAny grace period granted by Member States in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 shall be as short as possible and shall expire by 9 June 2015 at the latest.", "Entry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 November 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 309, 24.11.2009, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Directive 2006/74/EC of 21 August 2006 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include dichlorprop-P, metconazole, pyrimethanil and triclopyr as active substances (OJ L 235, 30.8.2006, p. 17).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (OJ L 153, 11.6.2011, p. 1).\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2012;10(11):2950.
