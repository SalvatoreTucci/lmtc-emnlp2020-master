Directive 2000/25/EC provided that the emission limits applicable in 2010 for type approval of the majority of compression ignition engines, referred to as Stage III A, were to be replaced by the more stringent Stage III B limits, entering into force progressively as from 1 January 2011 with regard to the placing on the market, and from 1 January 2010 as regards the type-approval for those engines. Stage IV, providing for emission limits more stringent than Stage III B, will enter into force progressively as of 1 January 2013 as regards the type-approval for those engines and as of 1 January 2014 with regard to the placing on the market.\n(2) The transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for re-designing the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. However, the current global financial and economic crisis or any economic downturn should not lead to a lowering of environmental standards. This revision of Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be considered to be exceptional. Furthermore, investments in environmentally friendly technologies are important for the promotion of future growth, jobs and health security.\n(3) Directive 2000/25/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow tractor manufacturers to purchase, during a given stage, a limited number of engines that do not comply with emission limits applicable during that stage, but which are approved in accordance with the requirements of the stage immediately preceding the applicable one.\n(4) Since 2005, Directive 2000/25/EC has provided for the evaluation of the possible need for additional flexibilities in relation to Stages III B and IV emission limits. In order to provide temporary relief to the industry when moving to the next stage, it is necessary to adapt the conditions for applying the flexibility scheme.\n(5) During Stage III B, the number of tractors that are placed on the market and that enter into service should, in each engine category, not exceed 40\u00a0% of the number of tractors placed on the market by the tractor manufacturer in that engine category. The alternative option of allowing a fixed number of tractors to be placed on the market and to enter into service under the flexibility scheme should be adapted accordingly.\n(6) Manufacturers of tractors falling within the scope of this Directive should benefit from European financial support programmes or any relevant support programmes provided by Member States. Those support programmes may favour projects employing the best available technologies with the highest emission standards.\n(7) Directive 2000/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive reflect a temporary difficulty faced by the industry. As such, the application of those measures should be restricted to the duration of Stage III B.\n(9) Current emission limits should be made more stringent, including with respect to ultrafine black carbon particles notably by introducing particulate number limits in future legislation if this is justified by relevant impact assessments,", "main_body": ["Amendments to Directive 2000/25/EC\nDirective 2000/25/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 1, the following indents are added:\n\u2018\u2014 \u201cflexibility scheme\u201d means the exemption procedure by means of which a Member State permits the placing on the market and entry into service of a limited number of tractors in accordance with the requirements laid down by Article 3a,\n\u2014 \u201cengine category\u201d means the classification of engines which combines the power range with the stage of exhaust emission limits,\n\u2014 \u201cmaking available on the market\u201d means any supply of a tractor or engine for distribution or use on the Union market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge,\n\u2014 \u201cplacing on the market\u201d means the first making available on the market of a tractor or engine,\n\u2014 \u201centry into service\u201d means the first use, for its intended purpose, in the Union of a tractor or engine.
