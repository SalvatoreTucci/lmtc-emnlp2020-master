SCHEEL\nANNEX\n1. MAXIMUM DESIGN SPEED      1.1. For the type-approval tests, the average speed shall be measured on a straight track, which the tractor shall traverse in both directions from a flying start. The soil of the track shall be stabilized ; the track shall be flat and at least 100 metres long ; however it may include slopes of not more than 1.5 %.\n1.2. During the test, the tractor shall be unladen and in running order without ballast weights or special equipment and the tyre pressures shall be those specified for road use.\n1.3. During the test, the tractor shall be fitted with new tyres of the maximum dimensions specified for the tractor by the manufacturer.\n1.4. The gear ratio used during the test shall be that producing the maximum vehicle speed and the throttle shall be fully open.\n1.5. To take account of various unavoidable errors due, in particular, to the measuring technique and the increase in running speed of the engine with a partial load, a result 10 % higher than the 25 km/h value shall be acceptable for the type-approval test.\n1.6. So that the authorities competent for the type-approval of tractors may calculate their maximum theoretical speed, the manufacturer shall specify as a guide the gear ratio, the actual foward movement of the powered wheels corresponding to one complete revolution, and the rpm at maximum power output with the throttle fully open and the speed governor, if fitted, adjusted as laid down by the manufacturer.\n2. LOAD PLATFORMS      2.1. The centre of gravity of the platform shall be situated between the axles.\n2.2. The dimensions of the platform shall be such that:        - the length does not exceed 1.4 times the front or rear track of the tractor, whichever is the larger;\n- the width does not exceed the maximum overall width of the tractor without equipment.\n2.3. The platform shall be laid out symmetrically in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the tractor.\n2.4. The height of the load platform above the ground shall be not more than 150 cm.\n2.5. The type of platform and the way it is fitted shall be such that, with a normal load, the driver's field of vision remains adequate and the various compulsory lighting and light-signalling devices may continue to fulfil their proper function.\n2.6. The load platform shall be detachable ; it shall be attached to the tractor in such a way as to avoid any risk of accidental detachment."}
