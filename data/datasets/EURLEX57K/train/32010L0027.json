That list included triflumizole. By Commission Decision 2008/748/EC\u00a0(4) it was decided not to include triflumizole in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier submitted a new application requesting the application of the accelerated procedure provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(5).\n(3) The application was submitted to the Netherlands, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/748/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n(4) The Netherlands evaluated the new information and data submitted by the notifier and prepared an additional report on 6 March 2009.\n(5) The additional report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 December 2009 in the format of the EFSA Conclusions for triflumizole\u00a0(6). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 12 March 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for triflumizole.\n(6) The new assessment by the rapporteur Member State and the conclusion by the EFSA concentrated on the concerns that led to the non-inclusion. Those concerns were the unacceptable risk assessment for operators and workers.\n(7) The new data submitted by the notifier show that the exposure of operators and workers may be considered as acceptable provided that additional protective equipment is worn.\n(8) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing triflumizole may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include triflumizole in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 November 2010 at the latest.
