whereas the doubts expressed concern not only pesticides and pesticide residues, but also dangerous chemical substances, and consequently the Commission will examine the possibility of fixing, as soon as possible, maximum levels for heavy metals in foods intended for infants and young children;\n(6) Whereas, therefore, as far as foods for particular nutritional uses intended for infants and young children are concerned, it is appropriate to adopt a very low common limit for all pesticides pending case-by-case scientific screening and evaluation of substances;\n(7) Whereas this very low common limit should be fixed at 0,01 mg/kg which is in practice the minimum detectable level;\n(8) Whereas the Commission in cooperation with interesed parties will endeavour to complete the review without delay and to fix the appropriate and scientifically justified levels to be incorporated in a new Annex VII;\n(9) Whereas severe limitations on pesticide residues should be required; whereas, with careful selection of raw materials, and given that processed cereal-based foods and baby foods undergo extensive processing during their manufacture, it is feasible to produce products containing very low levels of pesticide residues;\n(10) Whereas, however, for a small number of pesticides even such low levels might allow the possibility that under worst-case intake conditions the ADI of these pesticides is exceeded; whereas, therefore, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods should be free of those particular pesticides and should be produced without the use of such pesticides;\n(11) Whereas, as and when ADI is derived from the scientific evaluation of pesticides carried out pursuant to Council Directive 91/414/EEC(11), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/1/EC(12), this ADI will be used as the basis for the establishment of maximum residue limits for processed cereal-based foods and baby foods, using, where appropriate, the approach followed in the framework of Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC;\n(12) Whereas this Directive reflects current knowledge about these substances; whereas any amendment, based on scientific or technical progress, will be decided by the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 89/398/EEC;\n(13) Whereas Directive 96/5/EC should be amended accordingly;\n(14) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["Directive 96/5/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. The following indent is added to Article 1(4): \"- 'pesticide residue' shall mean the residue in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods of a plant protection product, as defined in point 1 of Article 2 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC(13), including its metabolites and products resulting from its degradation or reaction,\"\n2.
