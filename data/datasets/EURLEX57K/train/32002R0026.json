That specific rate must be fixed each month for the previous month. However, in the case of the reimbursable amounts applying from 1 January 1999, as a result of the introduction of the agrimonetary arrangements for the euro from that date, the fixing of the conversion rate should be limited to the specific exchange rates prevailing between the euro and the national currencies of the Member States that have not adopted the single currency.\n(3) Application of these provisions will lead to the fixing, for December 2001, of the specific exchange rate for the amount of the reimbursement of storage costs in the various national currencies as indicated in the Annex to this Regulation,", "main_body": ["The specific exchange rate to be used for converting the amount of the reimbursement of the storage costs referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 into national currency for December 2001 shall be as indicated in the Annex hereto.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 9 January 2002.\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 December 2001.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 8 January 2002.\nFor the Commission\nFranz Fischler\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 94.\n(3) OJ L 200, 25.7.2001, p. 19.\n(4) OJ L 258, 27.9.2001, p. 9.\n(5) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n(6) OJ L 175, 14.7.2000, p. 59.\nANNEX\nto the Commission Regulation of 8 January 2002 fixing, for December 2001, the specific exchange rate for the amount of the reimbursement of storage costs in the sugar sector\nSpecific exchange rate\n>TABLE>"}
