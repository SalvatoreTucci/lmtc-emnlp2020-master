Provisional measures\n(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92 (2), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferrosilicon originating in Poland and Egypt. The provisional anti-dumping duty was extended for a maximum of two months by Regulation (EEC) No  2778/92 (3).\nB. Subsequent procedure\n(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Polish exporter concerned made its views on the conclusions of the investigation known in writing.\n(3) At its request, the exporter was informed of the principal facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission proposed to recommend the imposition of a definitive duty and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of the  provisional duty. The Poles' written comments were taken into account and the Commission's conclusions amended accordingly as appropriate.\nC. Dumping\n(4) In Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92 the Commission calculated the dumping margin for each exporter as equal to the difference between the normal value and the price of exports to the Community, duly adjusted.\n(5) On the basis of the free-at-Community-frontier price, the average weighted margin for the exporters concerned was established as follows:\n- Poland's producers/exporters: 43,9 %,\n- the Egyptian producer/exporter Efaco, Egyptian Ferroalloys Co: 61,5 %.\n(6) As no further information has been forthcoming since the imposition of the provisional duty, the conclusions of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92 in respect of dumping are confirmed by the Council.\nD. Injury\n(7) No further information concerning the injury established over the period of the investigation or regarding the causal link between injury and dumping has been submitted since the imposition of the provisional duty.\nThe conclusions of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92 in respect of injury are therefore confirmed.\nE. Community interest\n(8) No Community users of ferrosilicon imported from Poland or Egypt have made their views known within the period specified in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92.\n(9) As regards the need to impose anti-dumping measures, a Polish exporter has highlighted the changes engendered by Poland's transition to a market economy. The exporter concerned stresses the general increase in Polish production costs entailed by  these changes, and claims that this will cause the prices of Polish products sold on the Community market to rise, thus ceasing to cause injury to the Community industry.\nThe Commission observes that the Polish exporter provides no figures in support of these claims, nor does it supply any evidence that export prices have risen.\n(10) The undertaking accepted (see below) takes account of the production costs of a producer in a market economy country and of the situation of the Community industry. If the Polish producer's costs, and hence export prices rise, the undertaking  places no further restraint on the Polish producer's exports, while at the same time protecting the Community industry from the injury caused by dumping.\nThus, the imposition of anti-dumping measures should not bar products originating in Poland from the Community market, where Community production is not sufficient to meet demand.\n(11) However, the Commission also had to take account of the worrying state of the Community industry, and of the likelihood of the situation worsening, which could lead to the disappearance of the sector altogether in the absence of appropriate  measures.\n(12) The Commission notes that it any of the parties concerned supplies evidence of a change of circumstances with regard to the normal value, export prices or the injury, for example, the case may be re-examined, in accordance with Article 14 of  Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.\n(13) The Commission confirms its conclusions concerning Community interest as set down in recitals 31 to 34 of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92. The Council confirms that it is in the Community interest to impose anti-dumping measures.\nF. Undertakings\n(14) On being apprised of the principal conclusions of the preliminary investigation, an Egyptian producer proposed a price undertaking which the Commission accepted in its Decision 92/331/EEC (4).\n(15) In its Decision 92/572/EEC (5), the Commission also accepts the undertaking proposed by the Polish producer Huta Laziska. The Advisory Committee has expressed no objection in this matter.\nG. Definitive duty\n(16) The provisional anti-dumping duty imposed in Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92 (recital 36) was calculated to remove the injury caused to the Community industry. The parties concerned made no representations to the Commission.\nFor this reason, and because it is possible that other Egyptian and Polish producers may export to the Community at dumping prices, the Commission's provisional conclusions are confirmed. Consequently, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed on  producers/exporters who have not given an undertaking, at the same rate as the provisional duty, namely 32 %.\nH. Collection of provisional duty\n(17) By virtue of the extent of the dumping margins established and the seriousness of the injury caused to Community producers, it is also necessary to collect definitively and in their entirety the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping  duty,", "main_body": ["1.
