The results obtained by the application of the specific control and inspection programme should be periodically evaluated in cooperation with the Member States concerned.\n(4) In order to harmonise the control and inspection of the bluefin tuna fishery at Community level, it is appropriate to draw up common rules for the control and inspection activities to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, and that Member States adopt national control programmes in order to match such common rules. To that end, benchmarks for the intensity of control and inspection activities should be fixed, as well as control and inspection priorities and procedures.\n(5) To ensure the follow-up of infringements in accordance with Article 25 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0(3), a framework should be set up under which all the authorities concerned may request mutual assistance and exchange relevant information in accordance with Articles 34a and 34b of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 and Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n(6) Joint inspection and surveillance activities should be carried out in accordance with joint deployment plans established by the Community Fisheries Control Agency set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005\u00a0(4).\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision have been established in concert with the Member States concerned.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Subject-matter\nThis Decision establishes a specific control and inspection programme in order to ensure the harmonised implementation of the multi-annual recovery plan set up by Regulation (EC) No 1559/2007 for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.", "Scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The specific control and inspection programme shall cover:\n(a) all fishing activities by vessels and traps catching bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean;\n(b) all landings, transfers and transhipments of bluefin tuna caught in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean;\n(c) all related activities of farms and enterprises engaged in caging or processing of bluefin tuna and/or in trade of bluefin tuna products, including importation, exportation and re-exportation, transport and storage;\n(d) the implementation of the annual fishing plans referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1559/2007;\n(e) the prohibition to use spotting aircrafts and helicopters established in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1559/2007;\n(f) the sport and recreational fisheries as referred to in Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1559/2007;\n(g) the implementation of the ICCAT Scheme of Joint International Inspection as referred to in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1559/2007.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The specific control and inspection programme shall apply from 1 April to 31 December 2008.", "National control programmes\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, Greece shall establish national control programmes, in accordance with the common rules set out in Annex I, as regards the activities listed in Article 2.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit to the Commission by 1 April 2008 their national control programme and the annual implementation schedule.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National control programmes shall contain all the data listed in Annex II.
