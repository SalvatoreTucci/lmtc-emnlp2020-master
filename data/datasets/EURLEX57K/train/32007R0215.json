Regulation as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p. 1).\nANNEX\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following units, modes of data collection, reference periods and definitions shall apply.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Units\nThe target variables relate exclusively to the household. Where dealing with financial services, the household should be understood as any member of the household.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Modes of data collection\nFor all target variables the mode of data collection is personal interview with the household respondent or extraction from registers.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference periods\nThe target variables relate to four types of reference periods:\n\u2014 last 12 months (Arrears),\n\u2014 next 12 months (Future expectations),\n\u2014 last three months (Uncleared balance credit/store card),\n\u2014 current (All other variables).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definitions\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amounts\n(a) Variables for collecting amounts: the amount is to be collected according to a harmonised discrete scale to be established by the Working Group on Living Conditions.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bank account\n(a) Bank current account: deposit account offering day-to-day money management facilities such as various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly to others. Standard services offered by current accounts include a cheque book, the facility to arrange standing orders, direct debits and payment via a debit card. A savings account is not a current account where no such facilities are available.\n(b) Bank account overdraft: the household is currently maintaining a negative balance on one of its bank accounts because of financial difficulties (urgent need of money, output higher than input, etc.). Interest is charged on the amount owed. The bank account does not need to be a current account.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credit/store cards\n(a) Credit cards (Visa, Amex, MasterCard, Diners, etc.) provide a specific credit facility: money is lent to people between the time they purchase goods and the time of full repayment of the amount; interest is to be paid on any balance that is not cleared at the end of the month. There are monthly statements for the money spent specifying the minimum amount to be paid. Credit cards are not bank debit cards, where the money spent on the card is immediately deducted from a linked bank account.\n(b) Store cards are credit cards issued by a single company/store and can only be used for payments to that company/store.\n(c) Uncleared balance: the household has not paid in full at the \u2018end of the month\u2019 the amount spent or owed with credit/store cards for at least the last three months because of financial difficulties.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Source of credit and loans\n(a) Credit and loans encompasses any commercial credit or loans with planned and scheduled repayments, except mortgage loans for the main dwelling. Overdraft facilities, credit or store cards for which repayments are not planned are not included. Borrowing from friends and relatives (informal credit) is not included either.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arrears\n(a) Arrears: amount owed (bills, rent, credit/mortgage repayment, etc.) not paid on schedule during the last 12 months for financial reasons; same concept as used for HS010, HS020 and HS030.\n(b) Total amount currently in arrears: the sum of the amounts the household currently owes that could not be paid on schedule.\n(c) Housing-related bills/payments: rent and mortgage repayment for the main dwelling and utility bills (water, electricity, gas, heating, etc.). Should correspond to the coverage of variables HS010 and HS020.\n(d) Other loans and credit repayment: cash loans (other than mortgage repayment for the main dwelling) or hire purchase instalments and the like (e.g. mail order catalogues, car finance, etc.). Minimum credit/store card repayments are also included. Should correspond to the coverage of variable HS030.\n(e) Other non-housing household bills: education, health, any other bills not covered by housing-related bills.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drop in income\n(a) Income: gross total income of the household.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Financial exclusion\n(a) Reasons why the household does not have a current bank account and needs one: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI111-MI114. Questions are filtered: households that do have a bank current account or do not need one should not be asked the questions.\n(b) Reasons why the household does not have commercial credit and needs it: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI122-MI125. Commercial credit: overdraft facilities, credit or store cards, mortgages and other loans or credit linked to purchases. Borrowing from friends and relatives is not included. Questions are filtered: households that do have commercial credit or do not need it should not be asked the questions. Households having borrowed only from family and friends should be asked the questions.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transmission of data to Eurostat\nThe target secondary variables on \u2018over-indebtedness and financial exclusion\u2019 will be sent to Eurostat in the household data file (H) after the target primary variables.\nAREAS AND LIST OF TARGET VARIABLES\nVariable name Module 2008 Over-indebtedness and financial exclusion\nCode Target variable\nBank accounts and overdraft\nMI010  Household has a bank current account\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI010_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\nMI020  Household is overdrawn on one of its bank accounts\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI020_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no bank account)\nMI025  Estimated total amount unbalanced on household's banks accounts in classes\n1-9 Class\nMI025_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no overdraft: MI020=2)\nCredit/store cards\nMI030  Household has credit card(s) and/or store card(s)\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI030_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\nMI040  Household has credit card(s) and/or store card(s) with uncleared balances\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI040_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no credit/store card (MI030=2))\nMI045  Estimated total amount unbalanced at the last monthly statement on household credit/store cards in classes\n1-9 Class\nMI045_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no unbalanced credit/store card (MI040=2 or MI030=2))\nSource of credits and loans\nMI050  Household has credits or loans (other than mortgage for the main dwelling)\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI050_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\nMI051  Household has mortgage for other than the main dwelling\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI051_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI052  Household has hire purchase instalments (e.g. leasing, car, technical equipment)\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI052_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI053  Household has home-related credit/loans (inventory, domestic appliances, repairs)\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI053_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI054  Household has credit/loans to pay for holidays/leisure\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI054_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI055  Household has credit/loans to pay for education or childcare\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI055_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI056  Household has credit/loans to pay for health issues\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI056_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI057  Household has credit/loans for investment or business start-up\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI057_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nMI058  Household has other cash loans (debt conversion, to cover overdraft, credit card and other bills, etc.)\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI058_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (MI050=2)\nArrears\nMI060  Arrears on other non-housing household bills\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI060_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no other non-housing household bills)\nMI065  Estimated total amount currently in arrears for other non-housing household bills in classes\n1-9 Class\nMI065_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no arrears currently (MI060=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no other non-housing household bills (MI060_F=-2))\nMI075  Estimated total amount currently in arrears for household housing bills/repayments in classes\n1-9 Class\nMI075_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no arrears currently (HS010=2 and HS020=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no housing household bills/repayments (HS010_F=-2 and HS020_F=-2))\nMI085  Estimated total amount currently in arrears for household other loans and credit repayment in classes\n1-9 Class\nMI085_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no arrears currently (HS030=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no other loans and credit repayment (HS030_F=-2))\nDrop in income\nMI090  Major drop in household income during the last 12 months\n1 Yes\n2 No\nMI090_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\nMI095  Main reason for drop in income\n1 Job loss/redundancy\n2 Change in hours worked and/or in wages\n3 Inability to work through sickness or disability\n4 Maternity \u2014 parental leave \u2014 childcare\n5 Retirement\n6 Marriage/relationship breakdown\n7 Other change in household composition\n8 Other reason\nMI095_F 1 Variable is filled\n-1 Missing\n-2 N/A (no drop in income (MI090=2))\nFuture expectations\nMI100  Expectation of financial situation in the next 12 months;
