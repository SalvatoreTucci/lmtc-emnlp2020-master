ensure adequate supplies for the Community, and the continuation of trade flows between the production and marketing sectors.\n(3) On the basis of the same data, in accordance with Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, the maximum quantity for which each operator may submit licence applications for the third quarter of 2005 should be fixed.\n(4) In view of the fact that this Regulation
