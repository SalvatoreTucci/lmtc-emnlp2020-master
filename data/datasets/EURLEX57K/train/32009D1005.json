The financing requires a revision of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013 in accordance with points 21, 22, and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, so as to raise the ceiling for the year 2010 for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by an amount of EUR 1\u00a0779 million in current prices.\n(2) The increase of the ceiling for subheading 1a for the year 2010 will be fully offset by decreasing the ceilings for commitment appropriations under headings 1a, 1b, 2, 3a and 5 for the year 2009 as well as the ceilings for commitment appropriations under headings 1a, 2 and 5 for 2010.\n(3) In order to keep an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments, the annual ceilings for payment appropriations will be adjusted. The adjustment will be neutral.\n(4) Annex I of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management should therefore be amended accordingly\u00a0(3),", "main_body": ["Annex I to the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management is replaced by the Annex to this Decision."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 17 December 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
