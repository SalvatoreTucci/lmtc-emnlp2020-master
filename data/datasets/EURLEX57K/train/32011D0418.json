Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in Cyprus.\n(5) Decision 2005/7/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Decision 2005/7/EC is amended as follows:\n1.

The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cHennessy Grading Probe (HGP 4)\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade of the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO) and photodetector of the type 58 MR and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements shall be converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP 4 itself or a computer linked to it.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcass shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nX1 = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcass, between the third and fourth last ribs,\nX2 = the thickness of the dorsal muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as X1.\nPART II\nUltra FOM 300\n1. The rules provided for in this Part shall apply when the grading of pig carcasses is carried out by means of the apparatus known as \u201cUltra FOM 300\u201d.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a 3,5\u00a0MHz ultrasound probe, 5 centimetres in length, featuring 64 ultrasound transducers. The ultrasound signal shall be digitalised; stored and processed by a microprocessor (type SHARC ADSP-21060L).\n3. The lean meat content of carcasses shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\u0176 = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcass,\nX1 = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the split carcass, between the third and fourth last ribs,\nX2 = the thickness of the dorsal muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as X1."}
