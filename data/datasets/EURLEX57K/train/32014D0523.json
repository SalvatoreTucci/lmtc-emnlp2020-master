It provides, amongst others, that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from third countries which have been free for six months from glanders.\n(2) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC\u00a0(3) establishes a list of third countries and parts of territories thereof from which Member States are to authorise the temporary admission of registered horses, the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export and the imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production and sets out the conditions for the importation of equidae from third countries.\n(3) Following the detection of glanders in Kuwait in 2010 the Commission, by adopting Commission Decision 2010/776/EU\u00a0(4), suspended the importation of registered horses from Kuwait. Kuwait has now submitted information demonstrating that the disease was successfully eradicated and that since the last case was confirmed on 19 December 2010 ongoing surveillance in the entire equine population has not revealed new cases.\n(4) Because more than six months have elapsed after the last case of glanders in Kuwait, it is appropriate to authorise the temporary admission, re-entry after temporary export and imports of registered horses from that country. Therefore, the entry for Kuwait in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["In Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC the entry for Kuwait is replaced by the following:\n\u2018KW Kuwait KW-0 Whole country E X X X \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2019", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 August 2014.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0268, 14.9.1992, p.\u00a054.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0192, 23.7.2010, p.\u00a01.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species, and amending Decisions 93/195/EEC and 94/63/EC (OJ L\u00a073, 11.3.2004, p.\u00a01).\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Decision 2010/776/EU of 15 December 2010 amending Decision 2004/211/EC as regards the entries for Brazil, Kuwait and Syria in the list of third countries and parts thereof from which the introduction into the European Union of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species are authorised (OJ L\u00a0332, 16.12.2010, p.\u00a038)."}
