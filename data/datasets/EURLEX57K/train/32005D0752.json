It is also important to encourage and facilitate cooperation between them and the Commission. The Expert Group will thus provide a useful forum to exchange views on the practical implementation and application of the Directive, including information on codes of conduct drawn up by consumer and professional associations, codes of conduct on on-line advertising by regulated professions; national case law, especially related to the liability provisions; new developments mentioned in Article 21 of the Directive, such as liability of providers of hyperlinks and location tool services and \u2018notice and take down\u2019 procedures; and to discuss the possible scope of the subsequent evaluation reports on the application of the Directive on electronic commerce.\n(4) Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation)\u00a0(2) establishes a network of public authorities responsible for the protection of consumers economic interests, partially harmonises their investigation and enforcement powers and provides mutual assistance arrangements between them. The provisions of Directive 2000/31/EC that protect consumers' economic interests enter within the scope of the Regulation. It is appropriate that the Committee set up for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 regularly informs the Expert group on electronic commerce about its activities which may be relevant for the latter,", "main_body": ["An expert group on electronic commerce (hereinafter referred to as the Group) is established.", "Mission\nThe Commission can consult the Group on any questions relating to the directive on electronic commerce.
