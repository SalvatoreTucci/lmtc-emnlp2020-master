In this heavily wooded mountain range, Vosges fir trees are by far the most abundant species. They are well suited to the soil, which is made up of an acidic substratum, granite and sandstone, and to the semi-continental climate, characterised by its humidity and coolness, which are favourable to the growth of the trees. The North-South orientation of the Vosges Mountains accentuates the characteristics of this climate, blocking clouds coming in from the west. This explains the abundant rainfall pattern (Foehn effect). Honey has long been produced in Lorraine. Various documents attest to awards won in competitions, most notably at a 1902 agricultural show.\nKey operators from the Vosges beekeeping community have done everything to promote and highlight the value of this specific production sector.\nThis led to the recognition of the \u2018Miel des Vosges-Montagne\u2019 designation of origin in a ruling by the Nancy Regional Court of 25 April 1952, which later became the \u2018Miel de Sapin des Vosges\u2019 registered designation of origin on 30 July 1996.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\nIn Le go\u00fbt du miel (Gonnet & Vache, 1985), the authors distinguish \u2018Miel de Sapin des Vosges\u2019 from other types of fir honey produced in France on account of its specific characteristics: darker colour, typical pale green highlights, very slow \u2014 if any \u2014 crystallisation, balsamic aroma and very characteristic malty flavour.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\n\u2018Miel de Sapin des Vosges\u2019 is a product that is very closely linked to its area of origin since it forms part of an uninterrupted chain from the Vosges fir. From this species, aphids extract the sap which they process into honeydew, which is foraged on by bees to produce this very characteristic honey.\nIts production is very closely related to the location of the conifer forests specific to the Vosges region, from which beekeepers have been able to draw and preserve their specific character.\nIn literature (Gonnet & Vache, Le go\u00fbt du miel, 1985) there are references to the unique character of \u2018Miel de Sapin des Vosges\u2019, which is associated in particular with the regional, climatic and soil conditions. Its specific characteristics stem from the fact that the bees forage on honeydew produced by aphids living on Vosges fir trees (Abies pectinata). It therefore draws its specific characteristics from the following factors: the species of fir which is foraged and the nature of \u2018Miel de Sapin des Vosges\u2019 (honeydew honey).\nClearly illustrating this close interaction between the environment and the product is the cyclical pattern to the production of honeydew, which is linked to the growth cycle of aphid populations. To this day, this phenomenon remains largely unexplained.\nReference to publication of the specification\nhttps://www.inao.gouv.fr/fichier/CDCMielDeSapinDesVosges.pdf\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs."}
