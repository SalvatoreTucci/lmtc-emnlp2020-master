The available information also shows that the new aggressive strain of the specified organism is present in a third country that exports the propagating material of kiwi plants, including pollen, to the Union.\n(2) The specified organism is neither listed in Annex I nor in Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. It appears from a preliminary pest risk analysis carried out by the Commission on the basis of an assessment prepared by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) that the specified organism causes harmful effects to plants of Actinidia Lindl.\n(3) Due to the complexity of the taxonomic identification of the new aggressive strain of the specified organism, it is appropriate to provide for measures applying to the specified organism as such, without restricting measures to the strain concerned.\n(4) Measures should be provided for concerning the introduction into the Union of plants for planting of Actinidia Lindl. from third countries. Measures should also be provided for concerning the movement within the Union of these plants originating in the Union.\n(5) Surveys for the presence of the specified organism should be carried out in all Member States and the results notified.\n(6) Member States should, if necessary, adapt their legislation in order to comply with this Decision.\n(7) This Decision should apply until 31 March 2016 to allow time to monitor the evaluation of the situation.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Emergency measures against Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Takikawa, Serizawa, Ichikawa, Tsuyumu & Goto\nPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Takikawa, Serizawa, Ichikawa, Tsuyumu & Goto, hereinafter \u2018the specified organism\u2019, shall not be introduced into or spread within the Union.", "Introduction of live pollen and plants intended for planting, other than seeds, of Actinidia Lindl. into the Union\nLive pollen and plants intended for planting, other than seeds, of Actinidia Lindl., hereinafter \u2018the specified plants\u2019, originating in third countries may only be introduced into the Union if they comply with the specific requirements for introduction, as set out in Annex I.", "Movement of the specified plants within the Union\nThe specified plants may only be moved within the Union if they meet the specific requirements, as set out in Annex II.", "Surveys and notifications of the specified organism\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall conduct official annual surveys for the presence of the specified organism on the specified plants.\nMember States shall notify the results of those surveys to the Commission and to the other Member States by 31 January of the year following the year of the survey.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall immediately notify in writing the Commission and the other Member States of the presence of the specified organism in a part of its territory where that presence was previously unknown.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the specified organism is found or suspected to be present in an area where its presence was previously unknown, the responsible official bodies shall immediately be notified.", "Compliance\nMember States shall immediately inform the Commission of the measures they have taken to comply with this Decision.", "Application\nThis Decision shall apply until 31 March 2016.", "Addressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2012.\nFor the Commission\nTonio BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR INTRODUCTION INTO THE UNION, AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2\nSection I\nPhytosanitary certificate\n(1) Specified plants originating in third countries shall be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate, as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 13(1)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC (hereinafter \u2018the certificate\u2019), which includes under the heading \u2018Additional declaration\u2019 the information set out in points (2) and (3).\n(2) The certificate shall include the information that one of the following points is fulfilled:\n(a) The specified plants have been grown throughout their life in a country where the specified organism is known not to occur.\n(b) The specified plants have been grown throughout their life in a pest free area, established as regards the specified organism by the National Plant Protection Organisation (hereinafter \u2018the NPPO\u2019) of the country of origin in accordance with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter \u2018ISPM\u2019) No 4\u00a0(1).\n(c) The specified plants have been produced in a pest free place or a pest free site of production, established as regards the specified organism by the NPPO in accordance with the FAO ISPM No 10\u00a0(2).
