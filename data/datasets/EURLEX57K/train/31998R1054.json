whereas, for exports of eggs in the natural state, the granting of a refund is now subject to obtaining an export licence comprising advance fixing of the refund; whereas, therefore, advance fixing of refunds for eggs incorporated into goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty should also be allowed for a period identical to that applicable to these products when exported in the natural state;\nWhereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1223/94 of 30 May 1994 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of advance-fixing certificates for certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2340/96 (5), stipulates that, during the period of reflection referred to in Article 3(3), a number of special measures, listed in the second subparagraph, may be adopted; whereas it is necessary to provide a single measure, namely the rejection of applications; whereas, in the absence of such a measure, which may be applied at the latest on the first day on which the certificates can be issued, the latter should be issued for the quantity and rate of refund requested;\nWhereas, in order to improve the management of acceptance or rejection of advance-fixing certificates, the days on which Member States inform the Commission of applications for certificates should be changed; whereas the time taken to issue certificates should be shortened whenever possible, while still carrying out the checks needed to ensure proper management;\nWhereas the current situation regarding exports of milk products in the form of goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty calls for very close monitoring of the advance fixing of refunds; whereas the present validity period of certificates for milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty is three months following the month of application for butter, and six months following the month of application for milk powder; whereas the validity period of certificates for milk products exported in the natural state is four months following the month of application; whereas a longer validity period creates increased uncertainty regarding the amounts committed in respect of refunds which have not been paid, and complicates budgetary monitoring; whereas the validity period of certificates for all milk products exported in the form of goods should accordingly be reduced to a period identical to that applicable to milk products exported in the natural state;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex II,", "main_body": ["In Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1222/94, the first subparagraph is hereby replaced by the following:\n'However, a system of fixing the rate of the refund in advance shall be applicable for basic products.`", "Regulation (EC) No 1223/94 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

Article 4(1) is replaced by the following:\n'1.

Article 4(2)(b) is deleted;\n4. in Article 8(1) 'every Tuesday and Friday` is replaced by 'every Monday and Thursday before midday (Brussels time)`;\n5. the following Article 9a is added:\n'Article 9a\nThe time frame for issuing certificates shall be extended by one day if the day on which Member States are required to inform the Commission of certificate applications referred to in Article 8 falls on an official public holiday of the Commission in Brussels, irrespective of whether or not that day is a public holiday in the Member State where the application for a certificate was lodged.`", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Offical Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply to applications for certificates lodged from 1 June 1998.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 1998.\nFor the Commission\nMartin BANGEMANN\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 318, 20. 12. 1993, p. 18.\n(2) OJ L 136, 31. 5. 1994, p. 5.\n(3) OJ L 268, 1. 10. 1997, p. 20.\n(4) OJ L 136, 31. 5. 1994, p. 33.\n(5) OJ L 318, 7. 12. 1996, p. 9."}
