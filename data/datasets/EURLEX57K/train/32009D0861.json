It provides that food business operators are to comply with certain procedures based on those principles.\n(2) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators and supplements the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. The rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 include hygiene requirements for raw milk and dairy products.\n(3) Pursuant to point (c) of Section B of Chapter 4 of Annex VI to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania (the Act of Accession), Bulgaria has been granted a transitional period, expiring on 31 December 2009, for compliance by certain milk processing establishments with those hygiene requirements.\n(4) Certain establishments which are authorised to process raw milk which does not comply with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (non-compliant milk) are listed in Chapter I of the Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession. Certain establishments which are authorised to process both compliant and non-compliant milk, provided that such processing is carried out on separate production lines, are listed in Chapter II of that Appendix.\n(5) Milk production holdings that do not comply with the hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 are spread over the whole territory of Bulgaria. The proportion of raw milk that complies with those requirements, delivered to milk processing establishments in Bulgaria, has only increased slightly during the last years.\n(6) Taking into account the current situation, it is appropriate to provide for a time-limited derogation from the hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 with a view to permitting Bulgaria to bring its milk sector in compliance with those requirements.\n(7) In light of this situation, certain milk processing establishments listed in Annex I to this Decision should be allowed, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, to continue to process also after 31 December 2009 compliant and non-compliant milk provided that the processing is carried out on separate production lines. In addition, certain milk processing establishments listed in Annex II to this Decision should be allowed to continue to process non-compliant milk without separate production lines.\n(8) The marketing of dairy products derived from non-compliant milk should, however, be restricted to Bulgaria or used for further processing in the milk processing establishments covered by the derogation provided for in this Decision.\n(9) The transitional period granted by this Decision should be limited to 24 months from 1\u00a0January 2010. The situation in the milk sector in Bulgaria should be reviewed before the end of that period. Bulgaria should therefore submit annual reports to the Commission regarding progress in the upgrading of milk production holdings supplying raw milk to milk processing establishments in that Member State and the system for collecting and transporting non-compliant milk.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["For the purposes of this Decision \u2018non-compliant milk\u2019 means raw milk which does not comply with the requirements set out in Annex III, Section IX, Chapter I, Subchapters II and III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.", "By way of derogation from the requirements set out in Annex III, Section IX, Chapter I, Subchapters II and III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, the milk processing establishments listed in Annex I to this Decision may continue to process, until 31 December 2011, compliant and non-compliant milk provided that the processing of the compliant and the non-compliant milk is carried out on separate production lines.", "By way of derogation from the requirements set out in Annex III, Section IX, Chapter I, Subchapters II and III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, the milk processing establishments listed in Annex II to this Decision may continue to process, until 31 December 2011, non-compliant milk without separate production lines.", "Dairy products derived from non-compliant milk shall only:\n(a) be placed on the domestic market in Bulgaria; or\n(b) be used for further processing in the milk processing establishments in Bulgaria referred to in Articles 2 and 3.\nSuch dairy products shall bear a health or identification mark which is different from the health or identification mark provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.", "Bulgaria shall submit annual reports to the Commission on progress made in bringing the following in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 853/2004:\n(a) production holdings producing non-compliant milk;\n(b) the system for collecting and transporting non-compliant milk;\nThe first annual report shall be submitted to the Commission by 31 December 2010, at the latest, and the second annual report by 31 October 2011, at the latest.\nThe form set out in Annex III shall be used for those reports.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 November 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a055.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0139, 30.4.2004, p.\u00a01.\nANNEX I\nList of milk establishments permitted to process compliant and non-compliant milk as referred to in Article 2\nNo Veterinary No Name of establishment Town/Street or Village/Region\n1 BG 0412010 \u2018Bi Si Si Handel\u2019 OOD gr.
