General\nThe SBI test facility shall be fully described in a future European standard.\nThe SBI test facility, in its entirety (including the surrounding enclosure), shall be the same in all cases, subject to any allowable variations (for example on tolerances) to be included in that European standard.\n2. Principle of the test\nA test specimen consisting of two vertical wings forming a right-angled corner is exposed to the flame from a burner placed at the bottom of the corner. The flame is obtained by combustion of propane gas, injected through a sandbox.\nAfter ignition of the burner, the following parameters of the burning process of the specimens are recorded: time to ignition, flame spread, heat release, smoke production and flaming droplets/particles.\n3. The test facility\nThe SBI test facility consists of a test enclosure, the SBI apparatus (trolley, frame, burners, hood, collector and tubing), the propane supply system, the smoke exhaust system and general measuring equipment.\nThe precise specification and configuration of the test facility will be defined in the future European standard referred to in point 1. The main components will be as follows:\n3.1. SBI test enclosure\n- Inner dimensions:\n- height 2,4 \u00b1 0,1 m (top of the frame level),\n- floor area 3,0 \u00b1 0,6 m in both dimensions,\n- windows: windows in the two walls facing the front side of the two perpendicular specimen planes,\n- one wall with opening for trolley; distance between trolley and side walls &ge; 0,5 m,\n- with trolley in place, the openings of the test enclosure, except the air inlet at the bottom of the trolley and the smoke exhaust opening in the hood, should not exceed 0,05 m2.\n3.2. SBI apparatus\nThe SBI apparatus consists of:\n(a) a trolley on which two perpendicular specimen parts are placed, with the primary sandbox burner at the bottom of the vertical corner; the trolley is put in place with its rear side closing the opening in the wall of the SBI test enclosure; the air inlet under the floor of the trolley is provided with perforated plates to produce an evenly distributed flow along the floor of the test enclosure;\n(b) a fixed frame into which the trolley is pushed and which supports the hood; the secondary burner is fixed to the frame;\n(c) a hood on top of the frame which collects the combustion gases;\n(d) a collector on top of the hood with a horizontal outlet for the exhaust; the baffles at the bottom of the collector prevent the flow in the hood from being too asymmetrical;\n(e) a measuring tube of defined dimensions and configuration.\nThe apparatus shall be capable of accommodating test specimens up to 200 mm in thickness.\n3.3. Burners and propane supply system\n(a) The SBI apparatus contains two identical sandbox burners, one in the bottom plate of the trolley, one fixed to a post of the frame, with the following specifications:\n- shape: right triangle (top view) with equal sides of 250 mm, height 80 mm, bottom closed except a 1/2'' pipe socket at the gravitational centre, top open; dimensions \u00b1 2 mm,\n- box made of 1,5 mm steel (stainless), filled with a 60 mm bottom layer of gravel (size 4 to 8 mm) and a 20 mm top layer of 'sand` (2 to 4 mm); metal gauzes shall stabilise the two layers and prevent the gravel from entering the gas pipe socket; thickness of layers \u00b1 2 mm,\n- positions:\n- the primary burner is mounted in the tray and connected to the U-profile at the bottom of the specimen position,\n- the secondary burner is fixed to the post of the frame opposite to the specimen corner, with the top of the burner at a height of 1 450 \u00b1 5 mm from the floor (1 000 mm vertical distance to the hood), its diagonal parallel and closest to the diagonal of the primary burner, and its 45 degree edges at 700 \u00b1 5 mm from the specimen positions;\n(b) the specimens are protected from the heat flux of the flames of the secondary burner with a shield of defined materials and configuration.\n(c) the burners must be equipped with an ignition device, for example a pilot flame or a glow wire;\n(d) the propane purity shall be 95 % or better. The propane is supplied through a mass flow controller with defined requirements.\n3.4. Smoke exhaust system\nThe smoke exhaust system must fulfil requirements to be defined in the future European standard referred to in point 1.\n3.5. General measuring equipment\nThe measuring equipment, in terms of type, performance and location, will be specified in the future European standard referred to in point 1.\n4. Test specimen\nThe corner specimen consists of two wings, designated the short and long wing respectively.\nTest specimens of sheet and discrete products shall have surface dimensions as follows:\n(a) short wing: 495 \u00b1 5 mm \u00d7 1 500 mm \u00b1 5 mm;\n(b) long wing: 1 000 mm \u00b1 5 mm \u00d7 1 500 mm \u00b1 5 mm.\nTest specimens of other product types, such as cables, pipes, ducts, tubes and loose-fill insulation materials shall be provided and mounted in a representative manner, which will be fully described in a future European standard.\nWhere appropriate, products shall be attached to a substrate in a representative manner corresponding to the end-use of the product. The substrates and mounting procedures will be as defined in a future European standard.\nProducts shall be attached to a backing board of specified type, and conditioned according to the provisions of a future European standard.\nThe mounted specimen wings shall be placed vertically in the trolley, and marked with horizontal and vertical lines. These procedures will be defined in a future European standard.\n5. Test procedure\nThe test procedure, including calibration, mounting procedures and operating conditions, and the parameters to be measured shall be detailed in a future European standard."}
