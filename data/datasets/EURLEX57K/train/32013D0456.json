That Directive incorporated UNECE Regulations in the EU vehicle type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to EU legislation. Since the adoption of Directive 2007/46/EC, UNECE Regulations have increasingly been incorporated into Union legislation in the framework of EU vehicle type-approval.\n(3) Changes to the Treaties on which the Union is founded occurred after the adoption of Decision 97/836/EC. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has substantially altered the procedure to be followed for the conclusion of agreements between the Union and international organisations, making it necessary to adapt Decision 97/836/EC to the new procedures.\n(4) The procedure for establishing the position to be adopted on the Union\u2019s behalf in the United Nations concerning the adoption of UNECE Regulations or amendments to UNECE Regulations should be adapted to the new procedures set out in Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(5) The same procedure should also be followed when the Union decides to apply UNECE Regulations to which it had not acceded at the time of its accession to the Revised Agreement, or decides to cease to apply a UNECE Regulation that it has previously accepted.\n(6) It is appropriate that the procedure for adopting proposed amendments to the Revised Agreement submitted by the Union, as well as the decision whether to raise an objection to a proposed amendment, be the same as the procedure for the accession to international agreements.\n(7) Decision 97/836/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Decision 97/836/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1) Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3 are replaced by the following:\n(2) Article 4 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n(b) Paragraph 4 is deleted.
