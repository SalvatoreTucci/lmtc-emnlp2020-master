The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.\n(4) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the name of Zoetis Belgium SA it is necessary to change the terms of the respective authorisations.\n(5) Regulations (EC) No 2380/2001, (EC) No 1289/2004, (EC) No 1455/2004, (EC) No 1800/2004, (EC) No 600/2005, (EU) No 874/2010, and Implementing Regulations (EU) No 388/2011, (EU) No 532/2011 and (EU) No 900/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(6) Since the modifications to the terms of the authorisations are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing
