The information recorded in the Community schedule of tables provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 218/78 is to be delivered to the SOEC in the following form:      (a) On nine-track magnetic tape/1600 BPI (630 bytes/cm) IBM standard label. (If this is not technically possible, special arrangements are to be made with the SOEC.)\n(b) If slack bytes are included in the tape, the SOEC must be informed.\n2. The data of individual tables are to be furnished in rows in records of fixed length. Each record shall consist of two parts : identification with six zones (country, region district, handicapped area status, designation of table, table row number) and information, comprising 10 zones of equal length for transcription of a row.\n3. Annex 3 gives, for each of the zones of such a record:      (a) the number of digits available;\n(b) the picture in the COBOL programming language appropriate to this number of digits - the meanings of the symbols used for the various pictures are given in paragraph 8;\n(c) the number of bytes required for this picture;\n(d) the consecutive numbering of the bytes for the zone in question;\n4. Annex 4 gives the codes to be used and the numbers of columns and rows in the various tables.\n5. If a table has less than 10 columns, \"0\" must be entered in the remaining zones of the information part.\n6. Records are to be sorted according to the code for the region, and the survey district, the code for handicapped area status, the code for the table and the number of the row (in that order).\n7. A block shall be determined by the number of records required for transcription for a given geographical unit of the data contained in all the tables of the Community schedule of tables.\nWhere a country does not provide information on a complete row or rows of a table the complete record(s) is/are deleted and the block length for that country reduced accordingly. Where two rows are merged the combined information is entered in the first (lower number) row and the other row deleted.\n8. The symbols used in the explanation of the picture have the following meaning: >PIC FILE= \"T0014667\">\nANNEX 3 DETAILED PROVISIONS FOR THE TRANSCRIPTION OF TABLES OF DATA\n>PIC FILE= \"T0014597\">\nANNEX 4 TABLE REFERENCE CODES AND NUMBERS OF COLUMNS AND ROWS\n>PIC FILE= \"T0014598\">   Member States have a choice as to blocking factor. The factor preferred by SOEC is 10. The SOEC must be informed as to what blocking factor has been used."}
