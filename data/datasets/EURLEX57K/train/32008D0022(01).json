As part of the revised policy, securities that previously qualified as financial fixed assets should be reclassified from the balance sheet item \u2018Other financial assets\u2019 to the appropriate item under the heading \u2018asset\u2019 depending on the origin of the issuer, the currency denomination and on whether the securities are held-to-maturity. Moreover, all financial instruments that are part of an earmarked portfolio should be included under the item \u2018Other financial assets\u2019.\n(3) Decision ECB/2006/17 does not contain specific rules on the accounting of forward interest rate swaps, foreign exchange futures and equity futures. Such instruments are increasingly used in the financial markets and may be relevant to the management of the ECB\u2019s foreign reserves. While forward interest rate swaps should be accounted for in the same manner as \u2018plain vanilla\u2019 interest rate swaps, foreign exchange futures and equity futures should be accounted for in the same manner as interest rate futures,", "main_body": ["Amendments\nDecision ECB/2006/17 is amended as follows:\n1.
