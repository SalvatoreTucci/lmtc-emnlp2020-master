Complementary training must be provided, if necessary, for the persons referred to in paragraph 1 who are already in practice where their competence in radiation protection has not been approved by the competent authorities.\n3.

(a) No radiological procedure should be carried out unless medically indicated (1);\n(b) individual or collective preventive radiological examinations, including nuclear medicine examinations, should be carried out only if they are medically and epidemiologically justified;\n(c) encouragement should be given to alternative techniques likely to prove at least as effective from a diagnostic or therapeutic point of view and to involve a lesser risk to health.\n2.  Measures should be taken to ensure that existing radiological and nuclear medical information and/or records can be forwarded quickly, possibly by the patient himself, to the persons referred to in Article 2 (1) of the Directive treating or examining the patient.\nMember States should take such necessary steps as they consider necessary to provide the persons referred to in Article 2 (1) of the Directive with information on any radiological examinations and/or treatment undergone by the patient in the past, provided the latter agrees.\nIn order to avoid unnecessary radiological examinations, the persons referred to in Article 2 (1) of the Directive should see if they can obtain the necessary information by consulting the results of previous examinations. This applies particularly to procedures followed for medico-legal or insurance purposes. Special care should be taken to ensure that such procedures are justified.\nWith reference to Article 4 of the Directive, Member States should endeavour to ensure that optimum use is made of the most advanced installations of radiotherapy, radiodiagnosis and nuclear medicine.\n(1) The scope of Directive and of these recommendations does not extend to the use of ionizing radiation in the field of scientific research."}
