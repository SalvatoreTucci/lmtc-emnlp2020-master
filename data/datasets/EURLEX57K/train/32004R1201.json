Detailed rules of application for this tariff quota were adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/1999 of 28 May 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries\u00a0(4).\n(2) To take into account the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, beneficiaries of this tariff quota together with Bulgaria and Romania, and the accession of Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia and pending the results of the negotiations of new tariff concessions for Bulgaria and Romania, it is appropriate to lay down in the detailed rules for the management of this tariff quota that for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 the available quantity should be staggered over the year in a suitable manner within the meaning of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.\n(3) To take into account the traditional trade patterns between the Community and Bulgaria and Romania, quantities should be fixed for three periods taking into account supplies in the reference period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003 of live animals originating in Bulgaria and Romania. Once the ongoing negotiations on additional protocols to the respective Europe Agreements with these two countries have been finalised and ratified, new management rules will be implemented at the date of entry into force of the new concessions.\n(4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads.\n(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 100 animals during the year 2003 given that a consignment of 100 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment. Operators in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, should be allowed to apply on the basis of imports from countries which for them were third countries during the year 2003.\n(6) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n(7) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2004 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable.\n(8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied.\n(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80\u00a0(5) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(6).\n(10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.\n(11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 1128/99 should be subsequently repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(13) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0178\u00a0000 live bovine animals of a weight not exceeding 80 kg falling within CN code 0102\u00a090\u00a005 and originating in Bulgaria or Romania may be imported for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 under this Regulation subject to any reductions negotiated subsequently between the Community and these countries.\nThe tariff quota shall have the order number 09.4598.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate of customs duty shall be reduced by 90\u00a0%.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantities referred to under paragraph 1 shall be staggered over the period referred to in that paragraph as follows:\na) 5\u00a0000 live bovine animals for the period 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2004;\nb) 86\u00a0500 live animals for the period 1 January 2005 to 31 Mars 2005;\nc) 86\u00a0500 live animals for the period 1 April 2005 to 30 June 2005.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, during one of the periods mentioned under paragraph 3(a) and (b), the quantity covered by licence applications submitted for each of these periods is less than the quantity available for the period in question, the remaining quantity of that period will be added to the quantity available for the following period.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible under the quota provided for in Article 1, applicants must be natural or legal persons and must prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, at the time they submit their applications for import licences, that they have imported at least 100 animals covered by HS subheading 0102 90 during the year 2003.\nApplicants must be listed in a national VAT register.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operators in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia may apply for import licences on the basis of the imports referred to in paragraph 1 from countries which for them were third countries in the year 2003.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof of import shall be furnished exclusively by means of the customs document of release for free circulation, duly endorsed by the customs authorities and containing a reference to the applicant concerned as being the consignee.\nMember States may accept copies of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, duly certified by the competent authority.
