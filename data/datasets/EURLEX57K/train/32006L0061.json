In the case of foodstuffs of animal origin, residue levels reflect the consumption by animals of cereals and products of plant origin treated with pesticides and, where relevant, the direct consequences of the use of veterinary medicines. Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected.\n(2) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and\u00a0changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data.\n(3) The Commission was informed that for several pesticides current MRLs may need to be revised in the light of the availability of new information on the toxicology and\u00a0consumer intake. The Commission has asked the relevant rapporteur Member States to make proposals for the review of Community MRLs. Such proposals were submitted to the Commission.\n(4) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the pesticides referred to\u00a0in this Directive via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organization\u00a0(5). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.\n(5) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to those pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organization. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects.\n(6) Through the World Trade Organization, the Community\u2019s trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account.\n(7) The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and\u00a090/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex\u00a0II to Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0I to this Directive.", "Annex\u00a0II to Directive 86/363/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0II to this Directive.", "Annex\u00a0II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex\u00a0III to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 20\u00a0January 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to\u00a0comply with this Directive.
