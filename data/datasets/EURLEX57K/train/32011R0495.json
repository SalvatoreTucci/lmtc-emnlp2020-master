Relevant data were submitted to support this request.\n(4) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 1 February 2011\u00a0(3) that the use of this new formulation of the additive on chickens for fattening and turkeys does not raise any additional concerns for animal health, human health or the environment and that it is effective in controlling coccidiosis. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 109/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 109/2007 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 May 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 31, 6.2.2007, p. 6.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2011; 9(2):2009.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation Provisional maximum residue limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin\nmg of active substance/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCoccidiostats and histomonostats\nAdditive composition\nMonensin sodium technical substance equivalent to monensin activity: 25\u00a0%\nPerlite: 15 \u2013 20\u00a0%\nWheat bran 55 \u2013 60\u00a0%\nActive substance\nMonensin A: not less than 90\u00a0%\nMonensin A + B: not less than 95\u00a0%\nMonensin C: 0,2 \u2013 0,3\u00a0%\nAnalytical method\n\u00a0(1)\n1.
