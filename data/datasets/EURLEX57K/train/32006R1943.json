And it seems as well pointless and costly to extend the Galileo Joint Undertaking beyond 2006, since the European GNSS\u00a0(4) Supervisory Authority, set up by Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004\u00a0(5) of 12 July 2004, will be able to gradually take over during the course of 2006 and then complete all the activities currently being carried out by the Galileo Joint Undertaking.\n(4) In order to enable the European GNSS Supervisory Authority to take over the activities of the Galileo Joint Undertaking in an optimum manner, it would, however, be desirable for the two structures to co-exist for a few months and for the European GNSS Supervisory Authority to be closely associated with the activities of the Galileo Joint Undertaking during this period.\n(5) Therefore, it should be provided for the Galileo Joint Undertaking to cease operating on 31 December 2006.\n(6) In addition, in order to correct the Statutes of the Galileo Joint Undertaking adopted by Regulation (EC) No 876/2002, which contain several erroneous or ambiguous provisions, those Statutes should be amended.\n(7) The relevant amendment procedures have been followed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 876/2002.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In the first paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 the words \u2018for a period of four years\u2019 are replaced by the words \u2018until 31 December 2006\u2019.", "The Statutes of the Galileo Joint Undertaking annexed to Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 are amended as follows:\n1.
