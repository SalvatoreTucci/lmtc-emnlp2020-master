Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.\n(4) The \u2018Biograce GHG calculation tool\u2019 was submitted on 19 February 2013 to the Commission with the request for recognition. The tool can be used to calculate GHG emissions for a wide range of different biofuels and bioliquids. Voluntary schemes using the tool need to ensure that it is applied appropriately and that adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing are met. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(5) The evaluation of the \u2018Biograce GHG calculation tool\u2019 found that it contains accurate data for the purposes of Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC and Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and complies with the methodological requirements laid down in Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(6) In the case of changes in the scheme the Commission will assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised,\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,", "main_body": ["The voluntary scheme \u2018Biograce GHG calculation tool\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018the scheme\u2019) submitted for recognition to the Commission on 19 February 2013 contains accurate data for purposes of Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC and Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC.", "If the scheme, after adoption of this Decision, undergoes changes to its contents in a way that might affect the basis of this Decision, such changes shall be notified to the Commission without delay. The Commission shall assess the notified changes with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.\nIf it has been clearly demonstrated that the scheme has not implemented elements considered to be decisive for this Decision and if severe and structural breach of those elements has taken place, the Commission may repeal this Decision.", "This Decision is valid for a period of five years.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 30 May 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 58."}
