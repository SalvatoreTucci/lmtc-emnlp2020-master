The country turned a corner when it held peaceful and credible general elections in April and May 2014, establishing democratically elected authorities, including an inclusive government that we believe is committed to rebuilding the country, strengthening its democratic institutions and moving towards socio-political stability and economic development.\nIn view of the restoration of constitutional order and the progress made towards Guinea-Bissau's commitments under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, as well as your undertaking to pursue their implementation by carrying out the necessary reforms and taking appropriate action, it is our pleasure to inform you that the measures which since 2011 have restricted the scope of EU development cooperation with Guinea-Bissau have been repealed. We are therefore fully resuming our cooperation with your country.\nSince Guinea-Bissau still faces many political and socio-economic challenges, we would like to encourage you to stay united and continue your efforts to strengthen democratic institutions, genuinely reform the security sector, strengthen the rule of law, combat corruption, impunity and drug trafficking, and promote sustainable development. The EU stands by you and supports all efforts undertaken in this direction.\nIndeed, the lifting of the appropriate measures under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement enables us to assist you in the organisation of the Round Table on Guinea-Bissau on 25 March 2015 in Brussels and to fully contribute to its success.\nMoreover, we will continue the consultation and preparation phase of the 11th European Development Fund with your government with a view to signing as soon as possible the National Indicative Programme that will support you in the implementation of your ambitious reform programme.\nFinally, we look forward not only to a full re-engagement with Guinea-Bissau through development, but also to a strengthening of our political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nF. MOGHERINI\nHigh Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\nFor the Commission\nN. MIMICA\nCommissioner"}
