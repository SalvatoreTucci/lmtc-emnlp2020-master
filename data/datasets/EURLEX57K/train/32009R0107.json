The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the EU and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.\n(4) It has been stated in the preparatory study that the number of SSTBs placed on the Community market will grow from 28 million in 2008 to 56 million in 2014, and the annual electricity consumption of SSTBs will grow from 6\u00a0TWh in 2010 to 14\u00a0TWh in 2014, but that the electricity consumption of SSTBs can be significantly reduced in a cost effective manner.\n(5) The electricity consumption of SSTBs can be reduced by implementing existing non-proprietary design solutions, which, despite being cost-effective, are not introduced onto the market in a satisfactory way because end-users are unaware of the running costs of SSTBs, providing manufacturers with no incentive to integrate such solutions to reduced power consumption during use.\n(6) Ecodesign requirements for the power consumption of SSTBs should be set with a view to harmonising ecodesign requirements for these devices throughout the Community and contributing to the functioning of the internal market and to the improvement of the environmental performance of these devices.\n(7) This Regulation should increase the market penetration of technologies yielding improved energy efficiency of SSTBs, leading to estimated annual energy savings of 9\u00a0TWh in 2014, compared to a business as usual scenario.\n(8) The ecodesign requirements should not have a negative impact on the functionality of the product and should not negatively affect health, safety and the environment.\n(9) A staged entry into force of the ecodesign requirements should provide an appropriate timeframe for manufacturers to redesign products. The timing of the stages should be set in such a way that negative impacts related to the functionalities of equipment on the market are avoided and cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular SMEs, are taken into account, while ensuring timely achievement of the policy objectives.\n(10) Measurements of power consumption should be performed taking into account the generally recognised state of the art; manufacturers may apply harmonised standards established in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(11) The requirements laid down in this Regulation should prevail over the requirements laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1275/2008 implementing Directive 2005/32/EC with regard to ecodesign requirements for the standby and off mode power consumption of electrical and electronic household and office equipment\u00a0(2).\n(12) Pursuant to Article 8(2) of Directive 2005/32/EC, this Regulation should specify that the applicable conformity assessment procedures are the internal design control set out in Annex IV to Directive 2005/32/EC and the management system set out in Annex V to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(13) In order to facilitate compliance checks manufacturers should be requested to provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V of Directive 2005/32/EC in so far as it relates to the requirements laid down in this implementing measure.\n(14) Benchmarks for currently available SSTBs with low power consumption should be identified. The availability of a \u20180\u00a0W-mode\u2019 on SSTBs could support consumers\u2032 behaviour and decisions to reduce unnecessary loss of energy. Benchmarks help to ensure wide availability and easy access to information, in particular for SMEs and very small firms, which further facilitates the integration of best design technologies for reducing the energy consumption of SSTBs.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2005/32/EC,", "main_body": ["Subject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes ecodesign requirements for simple set-top boxes.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Directive 2005/32/EC shall apply.
