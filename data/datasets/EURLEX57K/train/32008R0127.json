Specifically, Slovakia stated in its statement of objection that registering the designation Oscypek would undermine the designation Slovensk\u00fd o\u0161tiepok, for which Slovakia had applied to the Commission for registration as a protected geographical indication\u00a0(3).\n(3) By letter dated 30 May 2007, the Commission invited the Member States concerned to start a consultation procedure.\n(4) An agreement was reached between Poland and Slovakia, which was notified to the Commission by the letter received on 28 June 2007.\n(5) Under this agreement, Poland and Slovakia recognise that the designations Oscypek and Slovensk\u00fd o\u0161tiepok refer to cheeses that are now produced quite differently, despite the fact that they share the same history and tradition. According to Poland and Slovakia, the key differences between the two cheeses (concerning the raw material used, the production method and physical, chemical and organoleptic properties) should not give rise to confusion amongst consumers. Poland and Slovakia agree that both designations Oscypek and Slovensk\u00fd o\u0161tiepok are legitimate and Poland underscores that registration of the designation Oscypek as a protected designation of origin would not undermine the right of Slovakian producers to use the designation o\u0161tiepok either alone or alongside other terms.\n(6) The agreement reached by the interested parties does not necessitate amending the information published in accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Accordingly the designation Oscypek should be registered in accordance with Article 7(4) of this Regulation,", "main_body": ["The designation specified in the Annex to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 13 February 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.
