whereas that exemption is to be granted within the limit of  tariff quotas calculated by product with reference to the average quantities actually disposed of  during 1982, 1983 and 1984 in that part of Spain which is included in the customs territory of the  Community or exported to the Community as at present constituted;\nWhereas the products originating in Ceuta which have enjoyed the benefit of the tariff arrangements  set up by Protocol 2 are no longer exported to the Community because of a decrease in volume of  fish catches put on to the market; whereas the tariff quotas opened for Ceuta were not extended  beyond 31 December 1992 on this account; whereas live fry and juveniles of sea bream and bass  henceforth replace these products in trade with the Community;\nWhereas in 1993 Ceuta exported to the Community 2,5 tonnes of live fry and juveniles of sea bream  and bass of CN code ex 0301  99  90; whereas these products, while covered by Article 3 of the  Protocol in question, are, however, ineligible for the abovementioned tariff quotas because  aquaculture was started only recently in Ceuta;\nWhereas Ceuta's location as an enclave on the African continent poses specific problems; whereas  the lack of both agriculture and industry sectors leaves fishing as Ceuta's primary sector;  whereas, since the crisis is occurring in that sector, aquaculture has the potential to offer  Ceuta's economic operators an alternative source of income to sea fishing;\nWhereas the Community accords some non-member countries preferential tariff treatment in the form  of exemption from customs duties for products of CN code 0301  99  90; whereas steps should be  taken to ensure that the tariff treatment of such products originating in Ceuta and imported into  the Community is comparable to that accorded to certain non-member countries; whereas the tariff  arrangements applied to Ceuta need to be adjusted accordingly;\nWhereas the joint declaration on Protocol 2 concerning the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla is  intended to permit the substitution of products covered by Article 3 of the Protocol in question;\nWhereas the Kingdom of Spain has asked the Commission to open a zero-duty Community tariff quota  for live fry and juveniles of sea bream and bass originating in Ceuta;\nWhereas a zero-duty Community tariff quota should therefore be opened for the products in question  and the annual quota volume fixed on the basis of annual production at three million individual  fish; whereas steps should be taken, order to follow the market trends for these products, to open  this quota in an initial stage for the period 1 January to 31 December 1995; whereas application of  the tariff quota is subject to compliance with the rules laid down for the common organization of  the markets;\nWhereas it is, in particular, necessary to guarantee all Community importers equal and continuous  access to the quota and ensure the uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for the quota to  all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quota is exhausted;\nWhereas it is for the Community, in compliance with its international obligations, to decide to  open tariff quotas; whereas there is, however, no reason why the Member States should not be  authorized, in the interest of the common efficient administration of the quota, to draw from the  quota volumes the quantities needed to cover actual imports; whereas, however, this method of  administration calls for close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which must  in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quota volumes are used up and inform the  Member States accordingly,", "main_body": ["This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the arrangements  provided for by Protocol 2 to the Act of Accession and its detailed rules of application to the  products not covered by this Regulation.", "From 1 January to 31 December 1995, the customs duty applicable on importation into the  Community of live fry and juveniles of sea bream and bass originating in Ceuta shall be suspended  at the level and within the limit of the Community tariff quota shown below:\n>TABLE>", "The product's originating status shall be proved in accordance with Article 6 of  Regulation (EEC) No 1135/88  (1).", "The tariff quota referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission,  which may take all appropriate measures to ensure efficient administration thereof.", "Where an importer declares in a Member State a product covered by this Regulation for  release for free circulation and applies to take advantage of the preferential arrangements and  that declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member State concerned shall, by  notifying the Commisison, draw an amount corresponding to its requirements from the quota volume.\nRequests for drawings, indicating the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be sent to  the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings shall be granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the  declaration for release for free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member State  concerned, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them to the corresponding  quota volume as soon as possible.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota volume, the balance  shall be allocated on a pro rata basis.
