For barley, the Community has decided to replace the system of preference margins by two tariff quotas: a tariff quota of 50000 tonnes for malting barley and a tariff quota of 300000 tonnes of barley, for which this Regulation makes provision.\n(2) The opening of this quota means that Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 has to be adapted. In order to enable the quota to be opened on 1 January 2003, provision should be made to derogate from Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, during a transitional period expiring on the date of entry into force of the amendment to that Regulation, but until 30 June 2003 at the latest.\n(3) To ensure that imports of the barley covered by this tariff quota are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences are to be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject where appropriate to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(4) To ensure the proper management of this quota, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in applications and licences should be specified.\n(5) To take account of supply conditions, a derogation should be made concerning the period of validity of the licences.\n(6) With a view to the sound management of the quota, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(6), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.\n(7) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(8).\n(8) Rapid two-way communication should be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Notwithstanding Article 10(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, the import duty for barley falling in CN code 1003 00 shall be fixed in the framework of the quota opened by this Regulation.", "0(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 shall apply to imports of the products referred to in this Regulation in excess of the quantity provided for in Article 2.", "1.
