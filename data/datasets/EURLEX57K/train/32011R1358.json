As the ECB\u2019s minimum reserve system does not need to be applied to the same extent as under normal circumstances to steer money market conditions, in order to enhance the provision of liquidity to counterparties to Eurosystem monetary policy operations it is necessary to reduce the reserve ratio to 1\u00a0%.
