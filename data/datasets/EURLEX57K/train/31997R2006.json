whereas, provided that Morocco levies an export charge, those arrangements provide for a further reduction of that levy corresponding to the amount of the special charge, but not exceeding ECU 14,60 per 100 kilograms, representing the reduction provided for in Article 17 (1) (b) of the Cooperation Agreement and a reduction of ECU 14,60 per 100 kilograms, representing the additional amount provided for in Annex B to the Cooperation Agreement;\nWhereas the Community has concluded an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters with the Kingdom of Morocco extending the special arrangements after 1 January 1994 and for the duration of the Cooperation Agreement, on the basis of a flat-rate reduction in the customs duties\u00a0(2);\nWhereas the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations\u00a0(3) provides that the variable levies applied to imports of agricultural products are to be replaced by fixed customs duties from 1 July 1995;\nWhereas continuation of the arrangements calls for the adoption of new implementing rules and the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1521/76 of 24 June 1976 on imports of olive oil originating in Morocco\u00a0(4);\nWhereas, in accordance with the Cooperation Agreement, the special export charge should be reflected in the price of the olive oil upon importation into the Community;

whereas provision should be made for those adjustments to be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats\u00a0(5);\nWhereas, by Regulation (EC) No 2146/95\u00a0(6), the Commission introduced an autonomous system as a transitional measure expiring on 30 June 1997;
