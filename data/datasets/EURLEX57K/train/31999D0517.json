whereas Commission Decision 97/735/EC of 21 October 1997 concerning certain protection measures with regard to trade in certain types of mammalian animal waste(5); lays down the conditions for sending processed animal waste to other Member States for incineration or burning as fuel; whereas, however, that possibility is not open to Portugal pursuant to Decision 98/653/EC;\n(2) Whereas Portugal has taken measures as notified to the Commission on 12 October 1998, including measures to destroy certain risk materials, to prohibit the incorporation of meat-and-bone meal in any animal feed, to require destruction of meat-and-bone meal, to recall and destroy any stocks of meat-and-bone meal, and of any animal feed that contains meat-and-bone meal; whereas those measures are considered to reduce the risk of exposing humans or animals directly or indirectly to the BSE agent;\n(3) Whereas Portugal has informed the Commission that it does not have sufficient capacity on its territory to incinerate meat-and-bone meal, animal feed that contains meat-and-bone meal, and processed specified risk materials; whereas Portugal has proposed to the Commission that it should be possible for such material to be sent for incineration in another Member State; whereas a reduction of the amount of such material stored in Portugal would further reduce the risk of exposing humans or animals directly or indirectly to the BSE agent; whereas, therefore, Portugal should be permitted to dispatch such material from its territory to other Member States for incineration; whereas it is necessary to lay down appropriate guarantees for the controls at the place of destination;\n(4) Whereas the prohibition on the dispatch from Portugal of bovine products was to apply only until 1 August 1999, provided that a risk assessment conducted on the basis of the findings of a mission of the Food and Veterinary Office, taking into account the evolution of the disease, demonstrates that appropriate measures have been taken to manage any risk, and that the relevant Community and national measures are complied with and effectively enforced;\n(5) Whereas at the General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health (International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)) Committee from 17 to 21 May 1999, a proposal of the OIE International Animal Health Code Commission concerning the criteria for the determination of the BSE status of a country or zone was adopted; whereas according to those criteria, a country or zone will be classified as having a high incidence of BSE if the BSE incidence rate, calculated over the past 12 months, has been greater than 100 cases per 1000000 within the cattle population over 24 months of age in the country or zone; whereas the current BSE incidence rate in Portugal calculated over the past 12 months per 1000000 animals over 24 months of age is 211; whereas, therefore, Portugal is to be classified as having a high incidence of BSE; whereas Article 3.2.13.9 of that Code recommends conditions for the import of deboned meat and meat products from cattle from a country or zone with a high incidence of BSE; whereas Portugal cannot provide guarantees that those conditions are met;\n(6) Whereas missions on BSE related issues have been carried out in Portugal by the Food and Veterinary Office from 22 February to 3 March 1999 and from 19 to 23 April 1999; whereas those missions contributed to the assessment of the application and effectiveness of measures to protect against BSE; whereas those missions concluded that serious efforts and considerable progress had been made in the implementation of risk management measures in a short period, despite not all measures being adequately enforced;\n(7) Whereas in those circumstances, it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on the dispatch of bovine products;\n(8) Whereas Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters(6), and in particular Article 10 thereof, lays down the rules for the communication by the competent authorities in the Member States to the Commission of information on operations, which are, or appear to be, contrary to Decision 98/653/EC and which are of particular interest at Community level;\n(9) Whereas Directive 89/662/EEC requires the Member State of destination to take appropriate measures in case of irregularities; whereas protocols should be laid down for such measures in the Member States of destination;\n(10) Whereas Decision 98/653/EC should be amended accordingly;\n(11) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["Decision 98/653/EC is amended as follows\n1.
