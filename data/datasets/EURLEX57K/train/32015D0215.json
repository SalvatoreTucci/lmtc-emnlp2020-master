provisional putting into effect of parts of the provisions of the Schengen acquis on the Schengen Information System for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION", "recitals": ",\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(1), and in particular Article 6(1) and (3) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) By Decision 2000/365/EC, the Council authorised the United Kingdom to participate in parts of the Schengen acquis.\n(2) Following the notifications of the United Kingdom of its wish to make use of the possibilities in accordance with Article 10(4) and (5) of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Decision 2000/365/EC has been amended by Council Decision 2014/857/EU\u00a0(2).\n(3) In accordance with Article 4 of Protocol No 19 on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union (\u2018Schengen Protocol\u2019), annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Decision 2000/365/EC specifies in Article 6(3) thereof read in conjunction with Article 6(1) thereof, that the provisions referred to in Article 1(a)(ii) thereof, as well as other relevant provisions concerning the Schengen Information System (SIS) adopted since 1 December 2009, but not yet put into effect, are to be put into effect, between the United Kingdom and the Member States and other States for which these provisions have already been put into effect, when the preconditions for the implementation of those provisions have been fulfilled, by an implementing decision taken by the Council, acting with the unanimity of its members as referred to in Article 1 of the Schengen Protocol and of the representative of the Government of the United Kingdom.\n(4) In November 2012, the United Kingdom expressed its intention to commence implementation of the following parts of the Schengen acquis: the SIS and the related data protection rules.\n(5) In July 2013, a questionnaire was forwarded to the United Kingdom, whose replies were recorded, and a subsequent verification and evaluation visit was carried out in the United Kingdom in accordance with the procedures applicable in the area of data protection.\n(6) As regards the application of the Schengen acquis relating to data protection, the replies to the questionnaire, and the visit carried out in October 2013 demonstrated that the requirements relating to legislation, manpower levels, infrastructure and material resources had been satisfied.\n(7) Therefore, the Council was in a position to conclude on 3 March 2014 that the preconditions for the implementation by the United Kingdom of the provisions of the Schengen acquis as referred to in Article 1(a)(ii) of Decision 2000/365/EC, in so far as they relate to data protection, have been fulfilled, allowing those provisions and their subsequent developments to be provisionally put into effect for the United Kingdom.\n(8) The United Kingdom indicated that it was ready to provisionally put into effect the parts of the Schengen acquis referred to in Article 1(a)(ii) of Decision 2000/365/EC, in so far as they relate to the functioning of the SIS, as from 13 February 2015.\n(9) Within six months from the date of the provisional putting into effect of those parts of the Schengen acquis, evaluation visits should be carried out in the United Kingdom to evaluate the functioning of the SIS in order to verify whether the SIS functions properly and whether Council Decision 2007/533/JHA\u00a0(3) is being applied correctly.\n(10) In accordance with the second paragraph of Article 23 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013\u00a0(4), the Decision of the Executive Committee of 16 September 1998\u00a0(5) (\u2018Decision of 16 September 1998\u2019) continues to apply until 1 January 2016 with respect to the evaluation procedures of the United Kingdom for the purpose of that evaluation.\n(11) In view of the outcome of that evaluation, the final putting into effect of the relevant parts of the SIS for the United Kingdom should be subject to a further Council implementing decision adopted in accordance with Article 6(1) and (3) of Decision 2000/365/EC read in conjunction with Article 4 of the Schengen Protocol.\n(12) This Decision should therefore put into effect provisionally the parts of the Schengen acquis referred to in Article 1(a)(ii) of Decision 2000/365/EC, in so far as they relate to the functioning of the SIS. Upon the successful completion of the above evaluations, the Council should, by 31 October 2015, examine the situation with a view to adopting an implementing decision setting the date for their final putting into effect.\n(13) In accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the establishment of rights and obligations between Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the one hand, and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, on the other, in areas of the Schengen acquis which apply to these States\u00a0(6), the Mixed Committee, established pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application, and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(7), has been consulted in accordance with Article 4 thereof with regard to the preparation of this Decision.\n(14) As regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n\u00a0(8) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1 of Council Decision 1999/437/EC\u00a0(9) read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC\u00a0(10).\n(15) As regards Liechtenstein, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss
