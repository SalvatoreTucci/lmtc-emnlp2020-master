The measures provided for in this Directive ensure a high level of health and consumer protection.\n(2) Textile and leather articles containing certain azodyes have the capacity to release certain arylamines, which may pose cancer risks.\n(3) Limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of azodyed textile and leather articles concern the completion and functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and, consequently, to amend Annex I to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(4).\n(4) The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE), after being consulted by the Commission, has confirmed that cancer risks posed by textile and leather goods coloured by certain azodyes, give cause for concern.\n(5) In order to protect human health, the use of dangerous azodyes and the placing on the market of some articles coloured with such dyes should be prohibited.\n(6) For textile articles made of recycled fibres, a maximum concentration of 70 ppm for the amines listed in point 43 in the appendix to Directive 76/769/EEC should be applied. This should be the case for a transitional period until 1 January 2005 if the amines are released by the residues deriving from the previous dyeing of the same fibres. This will allow for the recycling of textiles, which has overall benefits for the environment.\n(7) Harmonised testing methods are necessary for the application of this Directive. The Commission, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 76/769/EEC, should establish such methods. The testing methods should preferably be developed at European level, if appropriate by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).\n(8) In the light of new scientific knowledge, testing methods should be reviewed, including testing methods for analysing 4-amino azobenzene.\n(9) In the light of new scientific knowledge, the provisions on certain azocolourants should be reviewed, in particular with regard to the need to include other materials not covered by this Directive, as well as other aromatic amines. Special attention should be paid to possible risks to children.\n(10) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC(5) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC(6) and Directive 98/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7),", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "Testing methods for the application of point 43 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2a of that Directive.", "1.

They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nThey shall apply these provisions from 11 September 2003.\n2.
