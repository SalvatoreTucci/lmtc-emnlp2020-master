This application was declared complete also by Decision 97/865/EC.\n(18) Such confirmation of the completeness of the data and information was necessary to permit a detailed examination of the dossier and to allow Member States the possibility to grant provisional authorisations, for a period up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive.\n(19) For these seventeen active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the respective applicant. The nominated rapporteur Member States, submitted draft assessment reports concerning the substances to the Commission on 14 May 1998 (carfentrazone-ethyl), 1 November 1998 (cinidon-ethyl), 30 November 1998 (cyhalofop-butyl), 20 May 1997 (ethoxysulfuron), 5 August 1998 (Famoxadone), 3 August 1999 (flazasulfuron), 6 January 1998 (flufenacet), 20 January 1998 (flumioxazine); 21 May 1997 (flurtamone), 18 March 1998 (fosthiazate), 26 February 1997 (isoxaflutole), 27 July 1999 (metalaxyl-M), 18 January 1999 (prosulfuron), 7 April 1998 (Pseudomonas chlororaphis), 11 October 1996 (quinoxyfen), 19 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus) and 2 April 1998 (sulfosulfuron), respectively.\n(20) It will not be possible to complete the evaluation of the dossiers within the timeframe provided by the decisions on completeness referred to above because the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States.\n(21) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility to prolong provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the concerned active substances for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that within 24 months the completion of the evaluation and decision making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed.\n(22) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,", "main_body": ["Member States may extend provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing carfentrazone-ethyl, cinidon-ethyl, cyhalofop-butyl, ethoxysulfuron, famoxadone, flazasulfuron, flufenacet, flumioxazine, flurtamone, fosthiazate, isoxaflutole, metalaxyl-M, prosulfuron, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, quinoxyfen, Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus and sulfosulfuron for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of adoption of this Decision.", "The present Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 February 2002.\nFor the Commission\nDavid Byrne\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 276, 10.10.2001, p. 17.\n(3) OJ L 152, 11.6.1997, p. 31.\n(4) OJ L 176, 20.6.1998, p. 34.\n(5) OJ L 96, 28.3.1998, p. 45.\n(6) OJ L 239, 30.8.1997, p. 48.\n(7) OJ L 351, 23.12.1997, p. 67.\n(8) OJ L 262, 24.9.1997, p. 7.\n(9) OJ L 130, 31.5.1996, p. 20.\n(10) OJ L 220, 30.8.1996, p. 27.\n(11) OJ L 52, 22.2.1997, p. 20.\n(12) OJ L 98, 15.4.1997, p. 15.\n(13) OJ L 189, 30.7.1996, p. 112.\n(14) OJ L 351, 23.12.1997, p. 67."}
