(2)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 9.     Whereas in order to achieve this aim the Member States are therefore required:      - under Article 2 (1) (a) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant annuities to farmers aged between 55 and 65 practising farming as their main occupation who leave agriculture;\n- under Article 2 (1) (b) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant to farmers a premium, which is not to be eligible for assistance and is to be calculated by reference to the utilized agricultural area released;\n- under Article 2 (1) (c) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant annuities to permanent hired or family workers aged between 55 and 65 who are employed on farms on which the farmer benefits from any measure provided for in Article 2 (1) (a) or (b) of the Directive;\nWhereas the grant of an annuity or premium is subject to the condition that the recipient cease working in agriculture and, where the recipient is a farmer, that he either sell or lease at least 85 % of his land to farms which are undergoing modernization pursuant to Directive No 72/159/EEC, withdraw it from agricultural use or sell or lease it to a land agency for reallocation as aforesaid;\nWhereas Member States may, on the ground of the age and/or means of the prospective beneficiary, vary the amount of an annuity or premium or refuse to grant the same ; whereas they may reduce the annuity granted to permanent hired or family workers by the amount of any unemployment benefit which the recipient receives;\nWhereas the abovementioned Regulations of 30 April 1974 are in conformity with Directive No 72/160/EEC;\nWhereas the EAGGF Committee has been consulted on the financial aspects;\nWhereas the provisions of this Decision are in accordance with the Opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structure,", "main_body": ["1.
