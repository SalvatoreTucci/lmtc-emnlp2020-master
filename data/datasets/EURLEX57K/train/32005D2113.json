It argues for wider use of ICTs and for continued policy attention to\u00a0ICT-related issues, which involves the need for monitoring and exchange of good practices. That Communication was the starting point for a reflection process that led to a new Information Society initiative in 2005, to start in 2006.\n(5) The new initiative, entitled \u2018i2010: European Information Society\u2019, was announced in the Commission Communication of 2\u00a0February 2005 to the Spring European Council, entitled \u2018Working together for growth and jobs \u2013 A new start for the Lisbon Strategy\u2019, aiming at stimulating the take-up of ICTs.\n(6) The Commission Communication of 1\u00a0June 2005, entitled \u2018i2010 \u2013 A European Information Society for growth and employment\u2019, outlines the key policy priorities of a five-year strategy to promote an open and\u00a0competitive digital economy. The promotion of exchange of good practices and the monitoring of the take-up of ICT-enabled services will continue to support the dialogue with stakeholders and Member States, notably in the context of the open method of coordination.\n(7) In the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a competitiveness and\u00a0innovation framework programme (2007 to\u00a02013), a framework programme for Community action in the field of competitiveness and\u00a0innovation, covering the period 2007 to\u00a02013, is proposed which brings together specific Community measures contributing to entrepreneurship, SMEs, industrial competitiveness, innovation, information and\u00a0communication technology, environmental technologies and\u00a0intelligent energy, including those measures provided for in Decision No\u00a02256/2003/EC.\n(8) Regulation (EC) No\u00a0808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\u00a0April 2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society\u00a0(5) establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on the information society. These statistics include information required for the eEurope benchmarking process, are relevant to the structural indicators supporting the monitoring of performance of Member States and are necessary in order to provide a uniform basis for analysis of the Information Society.\n(9) In the 12 months between the expiry of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and the anticipated start of the Framework Programme in 2007, the take-up of ICTs across the economy needs to be monitored and supported through continuation of benchmarking and statistical analysis based on structural indicators, and the exchange of good practices. The actions taken under the programme on benchmarking, good practices and policy coordination in 2006 will support the achievement of the objectives of the abovementioned Commission Communications of 2\u00a0February 2005 and 1\u00a0June 2005.\n(10) The mechanisms for monitoring and for the exchange of experiences, benchmarking activities, dissemination of good practices and analysis of economic and societal consequences of the information society should be continued in 2006 to achieve the objectives of the Commission Communication of 2\u00a0February 2005, aiming at stimulating the take-up of ICTs as a continuation of the eEurope agenda, and those of the Commission Communication of 1\u00a0June 2005.\n(11) Decision No\u00a02256/2003/EC should therefore be amended,", "main_body": ["Decision No\u00a02256/2003/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1. the following Article shall be inserted:\n(a) to monitor performance of and within Member States and to\u00a0compare it with the best in the world by using, where possible, official statistics;\n(b) to support efforts by Member States to stimulate the use of ICTs at national, regional or local level, by analysis of good practices and by the complementary interaction of developing mechanisms of exchange of experiences;\n(c) to analyse the economic and societal consequences of the information society with a view to facilitating policy discussions particularly in terms of competitiveness, growth and employment as well as in terms of social inclusion.\n2. the following Article shall be inserted:\n(a) Action 1\n\u2014 data collection and analysis on the basis of the benchmarking indicators as defined in the Council resolution of 18\u00a0February 2003 on the implementation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan, including regional indicators, where appropriate, and Regulation (EC) No\u00a0808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21\u00a0April 2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society\u00a0(6).\n(b) Action 2\n\u2014 studies to\u00a0identify good practices, at national, regional and local level, contributing to successful take up of ICTs across the economy,\n\u2014 support for targeted conferences, seminars or workshops, dissemination, information and\u00a0communication activities in support of the objectives of the Commission Communication of 2\u00a0February 2005 to the Spring European Council, entitled \u201cWorking together for growth and jobs \u2013 A new start for the Lisbon Strategy\u201d, aiming at stimulating the take-up of ICTs as a continuation of the eEurope agenda, and the Commission Communication of 1\u00a0June 2005, entitled \u201ci2010 \u2013 A European Information Society for growth and employment\u201d;, promoting an open and\u00a0competitive digital economy, in order to promote cooperation and exchange of experiences and good practices as defined in Article\u00a01a(1)(b).\n(c) Action 3\n\u2014 support the work of social and economic experts with a view to providing the Commission with input as regards prospective policy analysis.\n3. in Article\u00a04, the first paragraph shall be replaced by the following:\n4. the Annex shall be replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Strasbourg, 14\u00a0December 2005.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nJ.
