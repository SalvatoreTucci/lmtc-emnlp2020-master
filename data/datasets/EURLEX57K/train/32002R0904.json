Experience has shown that such a period is often too short because of the time taken by goods to reach ports; that period of validity should therefore be extended.\n(2) It has been found that, in periods of an increase in refund rates, the security of EUR 30 per tonne laid down in Article 10(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 is not sufficient to prevent large numbers of export licences in force for rice being returned to the issuing authorities. As such returns may generate problems in the administration of the exports, they should be discouraged by raising this guarantee.\n(3) Article 10(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 lays down a security of EUR 20 per tonne for the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92. Given the general reduction in refund levels the securities for export licences should also be reduced.\n(4) Article 10(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 lays down for malt three different security amounts depending on the period of validity of the export licences. Given the reduction in refund levels for malt exports the securities for those licences should be reduced and standardised.\n(5) Since the application of Agenda 2000, more and more cereal products have been exported with a refund equal to zero. Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 provides for a monthly adjustment of the amount of the refund. To avoid those cereal exports being regarded as subsidised under the rules of the World Trade Organisation negative corrections should be applied. To simplify administration of the exports it is preferable to regard a refund at an amount equal to zero as being ineligible for such an adjustment.\n(6) Article 12(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 stipulates that the adjustment provisions are not to apply to food aid operations. Since a similar provision has been introduced into Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001 laying down detailed rules for the export of products supplied as food aid that paragraph should be repealed.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 7(2a) is replaced by the following: \"2a.
