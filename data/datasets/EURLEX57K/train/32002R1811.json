In this context, ICCAT adopted a decision showing that during 2000, the European Community under-exploited its quota by 1696 tonnes for South Atlantic blue-fin tuna and by two tonnes for South Atlantic swordfish as well as over-exploited its quota of North Atlantic swordfish by 147,5 tonnes.\n(8) In order to respect the adjustments to the Community quotas established by ICCAT, and taking into account the under-utilisation and the over-utilisation attributed to the European Community resulting from the under-exploitation of South Atlantic blue-fin tuna and swordfish and the over-exploitation by certain Member States of the 2000 fishing possibilities of North Atlantic swordfish established by ICCAT, it is necessary that the distribution of under-utilisation and over-utilisation is carried out on the basis of the respective contribution of each Member State towards the under-utilisation and over-utilisation without modifying the distribution key established under Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001(2) concerning the annual allocation of TACs.\n(9) In accordance with Article 10 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species(3) the number of Community fishing vessels that are fishing for northern albacore as a target species should be determined, based on the average number of fishing vessels fishing for this species during the period 1993 and 1995. That number of vessels should be distributed among the Member States.\n(10) At its extraordinary meeting in November 2000, ICCAT recommended that quotas should be introduced for white marlin and blue marlin in the Atlantic Ocean.\n(11) The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC), recommended technical conservation measures in March 2001 for the cod trawl fishery. Therefore, point 3 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 should be changed.\n(12) Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 is amended as follows:\n1. The first paragraph of Article 17(1) shall be replaced by the following: \"The use of trawl net having in any section thereof net meshes of dimensions less than 130 mm shall be prohibited for direct fishing of the species referred to in Annex IX.
