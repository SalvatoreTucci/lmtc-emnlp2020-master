Moreover, some Member States do not have any domestic or agreement-based provisions for the prevention of abuse.\n(5) Therefore, the inclusion of a common minimum anti-abuse rule in Directive 2011/96/EU would be very helpful to prevent misuse of that Directive and to ensure greater consistency in its application in different Member States.\n(6) The application of anti-abuse rules should be proportionate and should serve the specific purpose of tackling an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuine, that is, which do not reflect economic reality.\n(7) To that end, when assessing whether an arrangement or a series of arrangements are abusive, Member States' tax administrations should undertake an objective analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances.\n(8) While Member States should use the anti-abuse clause to tackle arrangements which are, in their entirety, not genuine, there may also be cases where single steps or parts of an arrangement are, on a stand-alone basis, not genuine. Member States should be able to use the anti-abuse clause also to tackle those specific steps or parts, without prejudice to the remaining genuine steps or parts of the arrangement. That would maximise the effectiveness of the anti-abuse clause while guaranteeing its proportionality. The \u2018to the extent approach\u2019 can be effective in cases where the entities concerned, as such, are genuine but where, for example, shares from which the profit distribution arises are not genuinely attributed to a taxpayer that is established in a Member State, that is, if the arrangement based on its legal form transfers the ownership of the shares but its features do not reflect economic reality.\n(9) This Directive should not affect in any way Member States' ability to apply their domestic or agreement-based provisions aimed at preventing tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.\n(10) Directive 2011/96/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["In Directive 2011/96/EU, Article 1(2) is replaced by the following paragraphs:\n\u20182.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall not grant the benefits of this Directive to an arrangement or a series of arrangements which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of this Directive, are not genuine having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances.\nAn arrangement may comprise more than one step or part.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of paragraph 2, an arrangement or a series of arrangements shall be regarded as not genuine to the extent that they are not put into place for valid commercial reasons which reflect economic reality.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.\u2019", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest.
