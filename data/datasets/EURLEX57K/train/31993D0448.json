The weighted average rate determined in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be replaced by the weighted average rate determined in accordance with Article 3 provided that the latter weighted average rate is lower than the one already used.\nThe VAT resources base for 1992 shall in such circumstances be amended accordingly, and the statement of this amended base shall be sent to the Commission by 31 July 1994.", "For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base for 1993, Germany shall determined the weighted average rate of VAT by breaking down operations by statistical category using the most recent 1992 national accounts figures available  when the statement for that base is produced.", "For the purpose of calculating the VAT own resources base for 1994, Germany shall determine the weighted average rate of VAT by breaking down operations by statistical category using figures taken, in accordance with the first subparagraph of", "(4) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, from the most recent 1992 national accounts available when the statement for that base is produced.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 July 1993.\nFor the Commission\nPeter SCHMIDHUBER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 155, 7. 6. 1989, p. 9."}
