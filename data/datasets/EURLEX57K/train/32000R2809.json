In the interest of simplification and taking into account the small volume of quotas for products originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the above provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should also be applied to these quotas.\n(3) To ensure that imports of the cereals sector products covered by the Czech, Slovak and Romanian tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties after a period of reflection and subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.\n(4) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for lodging licence applications should be laid down and, notwithstanding Articles 8 and 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.\n(5) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.\n(6) To ensure efficient management of the quota, the import licences should not be transferable and the import licence security should be fixed at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2110/2000(9).\n(7) For the same reasons rapid two-way communication must be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.\n(8) The import duties on products falling within CN codes 1107 10 19 and 1001 90 99 (serial No 09.4619 for the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and serial No 09.4759 for Romania) listed in points II, III and VI of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1218/96(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2511/2000(11), as worded before the entry into force of this Regulation and imported under licences applied for on or after 1 July 2000 are reimbursed in accordance with Articles 878 to 898 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1218/96 lays down detailed rules applying to the import of certain cereals originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Romania under quotas opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95(12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2435/98(13).
