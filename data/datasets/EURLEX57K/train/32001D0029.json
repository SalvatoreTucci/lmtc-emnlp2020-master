The surveillance programme, which included sampling of slaughter groups at the abattoir and voluntary measures in farms, showed some success in reducing the prevalence of campylobacter in the slaughter groups of broilers.\n(7) The Swedish authorities presented on 31 May 2000 a national surveillance programme of campylobacter in broilers, and a revised programme on 13 October 2000, to estimate the baseline prevalence both in primary production and in the food chain and to progressively reinforce implementation of hygienic measures in farms with a view to lower the prevalence at farm level and subsequently along the food chain.\n(8) The programme can provide technical and scientific information potentially valuable for the development of Community veterinary legislation.\n(9) In the light of the importance of campylobacter as a zoonosis, it is appropriate to provide financial assistance to cover certain costs incurred by Sweden.\n(10) The financial assistance provided shall be up to a maximum of EUR 120000 for the period to 31 December 2001.\n(11) Pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.\n(12) A financial contribution from the Community shall be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,", "main_body": ["1.
