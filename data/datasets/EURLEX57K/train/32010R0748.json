These producers and exporters have eventually their products exported to the Union through a Chinese exporting producer benefiting from a duty rate for cooperating exporters not selected to be part of the sample of 8,4\u00a0% (XIAMEN XINGXIA POLYMERS CO., LTD), listed together with other non-sampled companies in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1425/2006), which is lower than the residual duty rate of 28,8\u00a0%.\n(6) There is a change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People\u2019s Republic of China which has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, without sufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.\n(7) This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from exports to the Union of the product concerned produced by Chinese exporting producers subject to the residual duty rate through a Chinese exporting producer benefiting from a duty rate for cooperating exporters not selected to be part of the sample rate (XIAMEN XINGXIA POLYMERS CO., LTD), which is lower than the residual duty rate.\n(8) Furthermore, the evidence points to the fact that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of price. There is sufficient prima facie evidence that the imports of the product under investigation are made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.\n(9) Finally, the Commission has sufficient prima facie evidence at its disposal that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.\n(10) Should circumvention practices covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than the ones mentioned above, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may also cover these practices.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(11) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. Registration of imports should be limited to products declared as having been manufactured by XIAMEN XINGXIA POLYMERS CO., LTD which shall therefore be declared under a specific TARIC additional code A981 without affecting the level of duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1425/2006.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n(12) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to XIAMEN XINGXIA POLYMERS CO., LTD as well as to other companies allegedly have their products exported to the Union through XIAMEN XINGXIA POLYMERS CO., LTD.\n(13) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are known and, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.\n(14) The authorities of the People\u2019s Republic of China will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(15) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REGISTRATION\n(16) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation, namely plastic sacks and bags declared under TARIC additional code A981 should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME LIMITS\n(17) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\n(18) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party\u2019s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NON-COOPERATION\n(19) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.\n(20) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION\n(21) The investigation will be concluded, according to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(22) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(4).\nJ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(23) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate General for Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.
