That certificate does not contain any specific requirements concerning semen used for fertilisation.\n(4) Problems have been encountered in trade in embryos in particular following the adoption of stricter rules for the admission of bulls into semen collection centres in Directive 88/407/EEC, as amended by Directive 2003/43/EC\u00a0(3).\n(5) In order to avoid certification problems, an additional certification requirement should be included in the current model animal health certificate providing for an obligation that semen used for fertilisation is to comply with Directive 88/407/EEC.\n(6) Directive 89/556/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex C to Directive 89/556/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 23 February 2006.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 February 2006.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 302, 19.10.1989, p. 1.
