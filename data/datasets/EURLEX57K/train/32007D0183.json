Those measures included, in particular, Commission Decision 2005/760/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries for the import of captive birds\u00a0(4). That Decision currently applies until 31 March 2007.\n(2) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine\u00a0(5) lays down the animal health requirements relating to imports of certain birds, other than poultry, as specified in that Decision, and the quarantine requirements for such birds.\n(3) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on animal health and welfare (AHAW) adopted on 27 October 2006 a Scientific Opinion on the animal health and welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds, other than poultry, into the Community (the Opinion). The Opinion has identified a number of areas where changes in Community animal health conditions for imports of those birds would significantly reduce any identified health risk related to such imports. Based on the Opinion, the animal health conditions for such imports have been reviewed and Decision 2000/666/EC has been repealed and replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007\u00a0(6).\n(4) As the new animal health conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 are stricter than those currently in force, that Regulation will not enter into force until 1 July 2007 in order to give Member States and the third countries exporting such birds to the Community time to adapt to the new measures.\n(5) In the light of the Opinion and the current world animal health situation regarding avian influenza, imports of such birds without stringent import requirements should not take place.\n(6) The protective measures provided for in Decision 2005/760/EC should therefore continue to apply until 30 June 2007. Accordingly, the date of application of that Decision should be amended.\n(7) Decision 2005/760/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["In Article 6 of Decision 2005/760/EC, \u201831 March 2007\u2019 is replaced by \u201830 June 2007\u2019.", "The Member States shall immediately take the necessary measures to comply with this Decision and publish those measures.
