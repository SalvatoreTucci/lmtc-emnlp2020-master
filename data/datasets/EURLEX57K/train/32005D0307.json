The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance was defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases\u00a0(2).\n(2) The Government of Latvia has requested the Commission to authorise one method for grading pig carcases and has submitted the results of its dissection trial which was executed before the day of accession, by presenting part two of the protocol provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.\n(3) The evaluation of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising this grading method are fulfilled.\n(4) In Latvia commercial practice may require that the head, the hind feet and the tail are removed from the pig carcase. This should be taken into account in adjusting the weight for standard presentation.\n(5) No modification of the apparatus or the grading method may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained. For this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,", "main_body": ["The use of the apparatus termed \u2018Intrascope (Optical Probe)\u2019 and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in the Annex, is hereby authorised for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in Latvia.", "Notwithstanding the standard presentation referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, pig carcases may be presented in Latvia without the head, the hind feet and the tail before being weighed and graded.

Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed \u2018Intrascope (Optical Probe)\u2019.\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a hexagonal-shaped probe of a maximum width of 12 millimetres (and of 19 millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a viewing window and a light source, a sliding barrel calibrated in millimetres, and having an operating distance of between 3 and 45 millimetres.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,\nx = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib."}
