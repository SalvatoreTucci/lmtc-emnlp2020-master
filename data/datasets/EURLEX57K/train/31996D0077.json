Spain can authorize the harvesting of the bivalve molluscs referred to in Article 1 in production areas where the PSP level in the edible parts of these molluscs is higher than 80 \u00ecg for 100 g but lower than 300 \u00ecg for 100 g.\nThe harvested molluscs must:\n- be transported in containers or vehicles sealed by the competent authority, directly to an approved establishment, especially authorized to carry out their treatment,\n- be accompanied by a document issued by the competent authority which authorizes the transport, attesting to the nature and quantity of the product, area of origin and plant of destination,\n- the subjected to the heat treatment defined in the Annex to this Decision.\n2. The final products resulting from the molluscs referred to in paragraph 1 must not contain a PSP level detectable by the bioassay method after the application of this heat treatment. Each lot shall be tested. This provision will be reviewed six months after the entry into force of this Decision following a report presented by the Spanish authorities.", "The competent authority shall check that the 'own health` checks provided for in Article 6 of Council Directive 91/493/EEC (3), drawn up and implemented by the person responsible for the establishment authorized in accordance with Decision 94/356/EC, shall apply specifically to the heat treatment defined in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 18 January 1996.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ No L 268, 24. 9. 1991, p. 1.\n(2) OJ No L 156, 23. 6. 1994, p. 50.\n(3) OJ No L 268, 24. 9. 1991, p. 15.\nANNEX\nHeat treatment applicable to bivalve molluscs Acanthocardia tuberculatum with the objective of reducing the PSP toxin to a level lower than 80 \u00ecg per 100 g\nMolluscs have to undergo the following operations sequentially:\n1.
