This boundary is difficult in practice to determine and also changes over time. The VAT arrangements applicable to construction and maintenance work on the cross-border bridges would be therefore be extremely complex for the operators carrying it out.\n(8) The derogation requested, which fixes the territorial boundary between Germany and France in the middle of the cross-border bridges concerned, will therefore simplify the collection of VAT on the construction and maintenance of these bridges.\n(9) The derogation will not reduce the taxable amount for VAT. It therefore does not adversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT,", "main_body": ["By way of derogation from Article 3 of Directive 77/388/EEC Germany and France are hereby authorised, in the case of the cross-border bridges on the Rhine referred to in Article 2, to set the territorial boundary between the two States in the middle of the bridges concerned as the place of taxation for the supply of goods and services, intra-Community acquisitions and imports of goods for the construction and maintenance of these bridges, including winter maintenance and regular cleaning.", "The cross-border bridges on the Rhine to which this Decision applies are those to be built in future which will link up with public highways not forming part of the network of motorways and trunk roads in France and with public highways not forming part of the Federal trunk road network in Germany.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2002.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nT.
