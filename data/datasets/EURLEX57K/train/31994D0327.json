Sampling of blood\nAll breeding flocks shall be sampled annually on the following basis. Blood samples must be obtained from at least 60 birds randomly chosen and examined by the Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test in accordance with the procedure listed in point 2.\n2. Procedure\n(a) Dispense 0,025 ml PBS into all wells of a plastic microtitre plate (with V-bottomed wells).\n(b) Place 0,025 ml of serum into first well of plate.\n(c) Use microtitration diluter to make two-fold dilutions of serum across plate.\n(d) Add 0,025 ml of diluted allantoic fluid containing 4 or 8 HAU.\n(e) Mix by tapping and place plate at 4 \u00b0C for a minimum of 60 minutes or room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n(f) Add 0,025 ml 1 % RBCs to all wells.\n(g) Mix by gentle tapping and place at 4 \u00b0C.\n(h) Plates are read after 30 to 40 minutes when control RBCs are settled. This is done by tilting and observing the presence or absence of tear-shaped streaming at the same rate as control wells containing RBCs (0,025 ml) and PBS (0,05 ml) only.\n(i) The HI titre is the highest dilution of antiserum causing complete inhibiton of four or eight units of virus (An HA titration to confirm the presence of the required HAU should be included in each test).\n(j) The validity of the results is dependent on obtaining a titre of less than 23 for four HAU or 22 for eight HAU with the negative control serum and a titre of within one dilution of the known titre of the positive control serum.\n3. Interpretation of tests\nThe antigen used will affect the level at which a serum is considered positive:\n- for four HAU a positive serum is any showing a titre of 24 or greater, for eight HAU a positive serum is any showing a titre of 23 or greater."}
