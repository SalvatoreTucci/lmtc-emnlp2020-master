The Member States should recognise the IMO FAL forms and the categories of information in them as sufficient proof that a ship has fulfilled the reporting formalities these forms are intended for.\n(8) However, the recognition of certain IMO FAL forms, in particular the cargo declaration and - for passenger ships - the passenger list, would add to the complexity of reporting formalities either because those forms cannot contain all necessary information or because well-established facilitation practices already exist. Consequently, obligatory recognition of those forms should not be introduced.\n(9) Maritime transport is a global activity and the introduction of the IMO FAL forms in the Community could pave the way towards their intensified application around the world.\n(10) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely to facilitate maritime transport, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4),", "main_body": ["Purpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to facilitate maritime transport by providing for standardisation of reporting formalities.", "Scope\nThis Directive shall apply to the reporting formalities on arrival in and/or departure from ports of the Member States of the Community, as set out in Annex I, Part A, relating to a ship, its stores, its crew's effects, its crew list and, in the case of a ship certified to carry 12 passengers or fewer, its passenger list.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \"IMO FAL Convention\" means the International Maritime Organisation's Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic adopted by the International Conference on Facilitation of Maritime Travel and Transport on 9 April 1965;\n(b) \"IMO FAL forms\" means A4 size standardised IMO model facilitation forms provided for under the IMO FAL Convention;\n(c) \"reporting formality\" means the information that, when required by a Member State, must be provided for administrative and procedural purposes when a ship arrives in or departs from a port;\n(d) \"ship\" means a seagoing vessel of any type operating in the marine environment;\n(e) \"ship's stores\" means goods for use in the ship, including consumable goods, goods carried for sale to passengers and crew members, fuel and lubricants, but excluding ship's equipment and spare parts;\n(f) \"ship's equipment\" means articles other than ship's spare parts which are on board a ship for use thereon and are removable but not of a consumable nature, including accessories, such as lifeboats, life-saving devices, furniture, ship's apparel and similar items;\n(g) \"ship's spare parts\" means articles of a repair or replacement nature for incorporation into the ship in which they are carried;\n(h) \"crew's effects\" means clothing, items in everyday use and other articles, which may include currency, belonging to the crew and carried on the ship;\n(i) \"crew member\" means any person actually employed for duties on board during a voyage in the working or service of a ship and included in the crew list.", "Acceptance of forms\nMember States shall accept that the reporting formalities referred to in Article 2 are satisfied when the information submitted is in accordance with:\n(a) the respective specifications set out in Annex I, Parts B and C, and\n(b) the corresponding model forms set out in Annex II with their categories of data.", "Amendment procedure\nAny amendments of Annexes I and II to this Directive and references to IMO instruments in order to bring them into line with Community or IMO measures which have entered into force shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 6(2), in so far as such amendments do not broaden the scope of this Directive.", "Committee\n1.
