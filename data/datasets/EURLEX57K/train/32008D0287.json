Through these training courses and seminars, government officials, national authorities and laboratory experts, shall be informed about and trained on Community feed and food legislation and the control requirements for feed and food to be allowed on the Community markets.\nThe Commission contributes to the training of officials in the Member States in that it supplements the training received at national level with training in aspects that are relevant from a Community point of view.\nFor 2008, training actions will concern the following subjects:\n\u2014 food and feed control procedures based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) principles; audit techniques to verify implementation of HACCP systems,\n\u2014 veterinary and food safety control checks in Border Inspection Posts (airports, seaports and roads/rail),\n\u2014 food Hygiene and Control: fish, meat and dairy products,\n\u2014 prevention, control and eradication of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies,\n\u2014 plant Health Controls (EC plant quarantine regime for potatoes, EC internal plant quarantine regime, EC plant quarantine regime for imports),\n\u2014 plant Protection Products (food and feed safety aspects): evaluation and registration,\n\u2014 zoonoses and microbiological criteria in foodstuffs,\n\u2014 animal Welfare: stunning and killing of animals at slaughterhouses and in disease control situation and animal welfare during transport,\n\u2014 food law, feed law, animal health and animal welfare and plant health rules (EUR 8\u00a0800\u00a0000).\nFinancing: through public procurement.\nThe global budgetary envelope reserved for the procurements during the year amounts to EUR 8\u00a0800\u00a0000.\nFor each of the technical issues mentioned above one or more specific service contracts will be signed. It is estimated to sign around 14 service contracts. External contractors are mainly involved in the organisational and logistical aspects of the training activities.\nThe aim is to launch the procurement procedure as soon as possible (approximately between March and May) to have the contracts signed during 2008.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Budget line: 17 01 04 05\nLegal basis:\n\u2014 Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, Article 66(1)(c).\nThe action to be financed under this budget aims at obtaining feedback on the trainings. Feedback is one of the key elements in the domain of better training for safer food. The production of a report on the 2007 activities is part of this.\nFeedback on trainings will be gathered also through an ex-post evaluation. Forms/questionnaires for this purpose will be distributed to a cross section of participants after their attendance at a training event in order to gauge the impact of the training on their professional lives.\nFinally, to better arrange the training programmes, IT equipment and tools, as well as promotional material, information and communication supports need to be financed (EUR 308\u00a0000).\nFinancing: existing framework contracts\nIt is estimated to sign around four service contracts.\nIndicative timeframe for signing the contracts: between March and July.\nSummary\nNo Name Budget line Legal base Amount in EUR\n1 Training: external contracts for the execution of the training programme 17 04 07 01 Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 8\u00a0350\u00a0000\n17 04 04 01 Directive 2000/29/EC 450\u00a0000\n2 Training: annual report, ex-post evaluation, IT equipment and tools, promotional material, information and communication support 17 01 04 05 Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 308\u00a0000\nTotal 9\u00a0108\u00a0000"}
