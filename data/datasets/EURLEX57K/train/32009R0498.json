In that context, Articles 2 and 3 and Articles 4 to 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and the Annexes mentioned therein aim to specify provisions addressed to the operators which are in direct connection with the objective of the protection of animals whilst other provisions of that Regulation concern administrative rules.\n(4) Article 168 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 provide that the respect of the animal welfare rules is a condition for the payment of export refunds. Therefore, it should be clearly set out that, without prejudice to cases of force majeure recognised by the case law of the Court of Justice, a violation of these animal welfare provisions does not trigger a reduction but the loss of the export refund, related to the number of animals for which the welfare requirements were not respected. It equally results from these provisions as well as from the animal welfare rules contained in Articles 2 and 3 and Articles 4 to 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and the Annexes mentioned therein that the refund shall be lost for the animals for which these welfare rules were not respected, irrespective of the concrete physical conditions of the animals.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 639/2003 is amended as follows:\n1. the first subparagraph of Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n2. the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of Article 5 is replaced by the following:\n(a) animals which have died during transport, except as provided in paragraph 2;\n(b) animals which have given birth or aborted during transport before their first unloading in the third country of final destination;\n(c) animals for which, in the light of the documents referred to in Article 4(2) and/or all other elements at its disposal concerning compliance with this Regulation, the competent authority considers that Articles 2 and 3 and Articles 4 to 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 and the Annexes mentioned therein have not been complied with.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply to export declarations accepted after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 12 June 2009.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 10.4.2003, p. 10.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, p. 1.\u2019;"}
