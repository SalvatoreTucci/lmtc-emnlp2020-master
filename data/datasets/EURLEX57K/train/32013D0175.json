That programme specifies the objectives to be achieved, the expected deliverables, the measures to be carried out, their duration and their cost with a view to a possible Union financial contribution.\n(2) The measures provided for in that programme fulfil the requirements of Commission Decision 2007/609/EC of 10 September 2007 on the definition of the measures eligible for Community financing in the programmes for the control of organisms harmful to plants and plant products in the French overseas departments, in the Azores and in Madeira\u00a0(2).\n(3) The measures laid down in the programme have been assessed by the Commission and discussed in the Standing Committee on Plant Health of 22-23 November 2012. A revised financial table was provided on 15 February 2013. As a result thereof, the Commission considers that that programme and its objectives meet the requirements of Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.\n(4) In accordance with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, an appropriate maximum to the Union financial contribution should be set, and payment should be made on the basis of documentation provided by France.\n(5) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy\u00a0(3), Union financial contributions to plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.

Article 112 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 provides that a grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun only where the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the action before the grant is awarded.
