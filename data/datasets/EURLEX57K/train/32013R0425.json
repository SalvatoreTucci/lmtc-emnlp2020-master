Since the amendment is minor within the meaning of the third subparagraph of Article 53(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1151/2012, the Commission may approve it without following the procedure set out in Articles 50, 52 and 7 of the Regulation,", "main_body": ["The specification for the protected geographical indication \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 is hereby amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "Annex II to this Regulation contains the Single Document setting out the main points of the specification.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 7 May 2013.\nFor the Commission, On behalf of the President,\nDacian CIOLO\u0218\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p.1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 182, 16.7.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe specification for the protected designation of origin \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 is amended as follows:\nDescription of product: Only the minimum soluble solids content had to be indicated so as to avoid excluding peaches with a content of more than 13\u00a0degrees Brix. This is an improvement which allows the designation \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 to be used for fruit with a higher sugar content than that previously set.\nMethod of production: One amendment concerns the permitted rootstocks: wild and clone peach rootstocks and prunus hybrids which have proved to be compatible with the ecotypes and are adapted to the local weather conditions are now permitted. These rootstocks have to be tested within the area defined in the specification. In the same article the planting distance has been amended for the simple or late vase (cup) pruning methods, given that this is more convenient for the growers and is already carried out in some orchards in the production area. As a result of the above amendment maximum production per hectare has been increased to 25\u00a0tonnes without changing the planting density.\nANNEX\u00a0II\nCONSOLIDATED SINGLE DOCUMENT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No\u00a0510/2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\u00a0(1)\n\u2027PESCA DI LEONFORTE\u2027\nEC No: IT-PGI-0105-01006-20.06.2012\nPGI ( X ) PDO ( )\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State or Third Country\nItaly\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product (Annex II)\nClass 1.6. Fruit, vegetables and cereals, fresh or processed\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of product to which the name in (1) applies\n\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI peaches are grown from two local peach ecotypes, Bianco di Leonforte and Giallone di Leonforte, which are not listed in the national catalogue of varieties.\nWhen released for consumption, the peaches must display the following characteristics: fresh, undamaged, with a healthy appearance; unaffected by rot or any changes rendering them unsuitable for consumption. They must also be clean, i.e.\u00a0free of any visible foreign substance and free of parasites at any stage of their growth, as well as free of any foreign smell and/or flavour.\nThe consistency of the flesh, measured with an 8\u00a0mm penetrometer tip, must be at least 4.5\u00a0kg/cm2 for the Giallone di Leonforte ecotype and at least 3.5\u00a0kg/cm2 for the Bianco di Leonforte ecotype; the soluble solids content must be not less than 11\u00a0degrees Brix and the weight between 100 and 350\u00a0g. The fruit must be round in shape, with asymmetrical \u2027halves\u2027; the flesh of the Bianco di Leonforte ecotype is white and the skin is also white, with red streaks (not always evident); the flesh of the Giallone di Leonforte ecotype is yellow and the skin is also yellow, with red streaks (not always evident). The flesh must adhere directly to the stone.\nOnly Class\u00a0Extra and Class\u00a0I peaches may be referred to as \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw materials (for processed products only)\n\u2014\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed (for products of animal origin only)\n\u2014\n3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area\nDuring the phase in which the fruit reaches the size of a walnut, but not after the month of July, parchment paper coverings in the form of small bags must be used as a physical defence against pathogens. Harvesting takes place between the first ten days of September and the first ten days of November. Picking must be by hand, avoiding the hottest times of the day and exposure to direct sunlight. Particular care should be taken when removing the fruit from the branch \u2013 this should be done without damaging the stalk. Also, the wire used to tie the parchment bags must be removed, so as not to damage the fruit.\n3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules on slicing, grating, packaging, etc.\n\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI peaches must be packaged in the production area so that they do not get dirty and bruised from transporting and excessive handling, which would expose them to mould and pathogens and thus compromise the characteristic qualities of the product.\n\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI fruit should be sold in cardboard or wooden trays or boxes, or in baskets of various sizes from 0.5\u00a0kg to 6\u00a0kg. Every package or batch must contain fruit of the same variety, quality class, size and degree of ripeness. The fruit must be of a consistent colouring depending on the ecotype. It must be packaged in a single layer and the individual peaches must be separated from each other by protective material. The protective and/or decorative material must be new, odourless and non-toxic; also, the product must not come into contact with ink and/or glue used for stamping or labelling. In addition, the packaging must be free of any foreign body.\nEvery package must be sealed in such a way that opening the package breaks the seal and it is impossible to change the contents following packaging.\n3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific rules concerning labelling\nThe label must feature the special logo and the EU graphic symbol.\nIt is forbidden to add any description that is not expressly provided for. However, references to brand names may be used, on condition that they have no laudatory purport and are not such as to mislead the purchaser.\nThe special logo is made up of an oval shape containing a representation of the Granfonte fountain, the monument that is the symbol of the municipality of Leonforte, in front of which, in the foreground, is a peach wrapped in its protective bag. At the top centre of the oval are the words \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 and at the bottom in the centre the Italian acronym \u2027I.G.P.\u2027 (PGI). The emblem has a thick green border and the background is a soft yellow, with the Granfonte fountain and the wording (\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 and \u2027I.G.P.\u2027) in green, a yellowy-orange peach with a green leaf and a white protective bag with grey shading and a black outline, as well as a black line representing the wire for closing the bag.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concise definition of the geographical area\nThe production area for \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI peaches is made up of the municipalities of Leonforte, Enna, Calascibetta, Assoro and Agira, in the Province of Enna.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link with the geographical area\n5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the geographical area\nThe area in which the peaches are grown is situated in the \u2027heart\u2027 of Sicily. The soil is alluvial and of a medium consistency, with high levels of clay and organic substances. There is a Mediterranean climate characterised by long, hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Rainfall is concentrated in the period from October to March. In addition, it is in the area delineated above that growers invented and developed the practice of putting the fruit in small bags while it is still on the branch, which protects it from pests and enables it to ripen smoothly before picking.\n5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specificity of the product\n\u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI peaches stand out from other products in the same product category by virtue of their firmness, their late ripening and the use of protective bags.\nThese properties mean that they can be marketed when the other products in the same category are no longer available. Harvesting takes place between the first ten days of September and the first ten days of November. A particular feature of \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 PGI peaches is that, for decades, they have been covered while still on the branch, as a means of combating the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata). Over time, this practice has been one of the more significant aspects in the production of these peaches and has made them more resistant to falling, as they are protected by a small, rain-resistant, silver parchment bag.\n5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI)\nThe application for PGI status for \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 peaches is justified by the product's reputation and the fact that it is so well known for its characteristic firmness and late ripening, which means that it is still available at times when it is virtually impossible to find peaches in the shops. The work of the growers themselves is fundamental \u2013 they have come to manage their own production, fully aware that they are dealing with a unique product. They often get members of their own families to work hard day and night, helping to put on the protective bags. The return from selling the peaches is such as to have improved the living conditions of the operators in the area.\nFor about the last 20 years, \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 has had a considerable economic impact not only in the area of production, but also in neighbouring municipalities at the time of an annual festival held on the first Sunday in October in the old centre of the small town built by Prince Nicol\u00f2 Placido Branciforti in the 17th century. The municipal authorities first set up this event in 1982, promoting and celebrating the fruit to encourage its development and raise awareness among Sicilian consumers of how special and unique a product it is. From its inception, the \u2027Pesca di Leonforte Festival\u2027 has existed to promote the late-ripening product.\nReference to publication of the specification\n[Article\u00a05(7) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0510/2006\u00a0(2)]\nThe Ministry launched the national objection procedure with the publication of the proposal for amending \u2027Pesca di Leonforte\u2027 in Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No\u00a0106 of 8\u00a0May 2012.
