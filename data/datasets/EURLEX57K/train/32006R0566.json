Article 1(5) of that Regulation fixes the period of validity of such import licences at three months.\n(2) In order to quickly obtain information on the quantities released for free circulation in the Community, the period of validity of licences should be shortened. To ensure the relevant information relates to the calendar year, the period of validity of licences should not extend beyond 31 December.\n(3) For the same reasons, and notwithstanding Article 35(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(3), the period during which operators must supply proof to the competent authority that the licences have been used should be shortened.\n(4) In order to have data on the entire period of implementation of the tariff-only arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005, the reduction in the period for submission of proof of use of licences should also apply to licences valid from 1 January 2006, the date from which Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 applies.\n(5) Indication of the origin of bananas released into free circulation in the Community is particularly important information for the purposes of monitoring imports under the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005. To make this information available, provision should be made for import licences to be issued for imports of bananas from a specified origin. To that end, a distinction should be made between bananas originating in ACP countries and those originating in other third countries.\n(6) To ensure that the market is adequately monitored, it is necessary to define the information on prices and quantities marketed which the Member States must forward to the Commission.\n(7) In order to detect and prevent false declarations by operators, Member States should notify to the Commission the list of operators operating under Commission Regulations (EC) No 219/2006\u00a0(4) and (EC) No 2015/2005 of 9 December 2005 on imports during January and February 2006 of bananas originating in ACP countries under the tariff quota opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas\u00a0(5).\n(8) Regulation (EC) No 219/2006 repeals Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001\u00a0(6), except for Articles 21, 26 and 27 and the Annex thereto, which it provides are to continue to apply to imports carried out under Regulation (EC) No 219/2006. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty, the content of those provisions should be incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.\n(9) Regulations (EC) No 2014/2005 and (EC) No 219/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
