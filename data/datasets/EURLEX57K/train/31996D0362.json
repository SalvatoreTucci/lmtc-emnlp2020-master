whereas that Decision has prohibited the dispatch to the other Member States and to third countries, in particular, of bovine semen, and certain other products from the UK obtained from bovine animals slaughtered in the United Kingdom which are liable to enter the animal feed or human food chains and materials destined for use in medicinal products, cosmetics or pharmaceutical products;\nWhereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee was consulted on 18 April 1996 and on 26 April 1996; whereas in the opinion of this Committee, bovine semen is considered to be safe for animal health with respect to BSE;\nWhereas the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology was consulted on the safety of certain bovine products on 11 April 1996; whereas the Liaison Committee of European Associations of the Perfume, Cosmetics Products and Toiletries Industries (Colipa) recommended several years ago to its members not to use source materials from United Kingdom bovine animals; whereas this Committee has declared that its members follow this recommendation;\nWhereas the Scientific Committee for Food was consulted on the safety of certain bovine products on 15 April 1996;\nWhereas the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products was consulted on 16 April 1996; whereas the pharmaceutical sector had already introduced measures relating to the sourcing of materials and their treatment; whereas every medicinal product undergoes a pre-marketing approval before it is placed on the market, by virtue of which the treatment process of any raw material is evaluated; whereas at the request of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, all Community marketing authorization holders, or applicants with a positive opinion from the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products or the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, have confirmed that the products concerned do not contain bovine tissue of United Kingdom origin;\nWhereas subsequently, additional information has been made available in order to facilitate a more complete risk assessment; whereas, on this basis, the Scientific Veterinary Committee on 26 April 1996 concluded that a combination of appropriate sourcing of bovine materials used and the application of minimum processing standards which have been shown to effectively inactivate the BSE agent, together give good reassurances about the safety of these products for food or cosmetic use; whereas, consequently, the Scientific Veterinary Committee has recommended safety parameters for the production of these products which are therefore considered to be safe; whereas, furthermore, specific rules for the veterinary control of establishments should be put in place;\nWhereas, therefore, the Commission considers that the products covered by the Annex to this Decision (such as gelatin and tallow) are safe;\nWhereas these products and bovine semen may therefore be exempted from the prohibition provided for by Decision 96/239/EC;\nWhereas in 1988 the United Kingdom introduced a requirement for animals affected with BSE to be completely destroyed; whereas the Council, at its meeting on 1 to 3 April 1996, concluded that bovine animals over the age of 30 months shall not enter the human food or animal food chains or be used for cosmetic or pharmaceutical products; whereas such animals must not be used as source materials for certain bovine products as referred to above;\nWhereas furthermore, certain bovine tissues must not be used as source materials for these products;\nWhereas it is necessary to lay down appropriate guarantees for the dispatch from the United Kingdom of products obtained from bovine animals which were not slaughtered in the United Kingdom;\nWhereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in the United Kingdom to verify the application of the measures provided for in this Decision;\nWhereas the United Kingdom has presented a proposal for measures to control and eradicate BSE in the United Kingdom, in particular selective compulsory slaughter of animals and/or herds identified as being most likely to have been exposed to infected meat- and bonemeal and an improved system of individual identification of bovine animals to ensure effective control of movements and traceability of animals (animal passport system);\nWhereas the Standing Veterinary Committee has not given an opinion; whereas the Commission has therefore proposed these measures to the Council on 23 May 1996 in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 89/662/EEC, the Council being required to adopt measures within 15 days;\nWhereas, however, the Council has not acted within the required time limit; whereas the Council has not decided against the proposed measures by simple majority within the same time limit; whereas these measures should now be adopted by the Commission,", "main_body": ["Decision 96/239/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
