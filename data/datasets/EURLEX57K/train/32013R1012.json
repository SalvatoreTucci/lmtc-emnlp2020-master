For a number of products, Appendix 2A to that Annex provides for the possibility of derogations from the rules of origin set out in Appendix 2 to Annex II in the framework of annual quotas. As the Union has decided to use that possibility, it is necessary to provide the conditions for the application of those derogations for imports from Costa Rica.\n(3) The quotas set out in Appendix 2A to Annex II should be managed on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code\u00a0(2).\n(4) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of
