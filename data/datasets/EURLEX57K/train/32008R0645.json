This natural handicap, as recognised in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, resulting from insularity, remoteness and outermost location can be remedied, inter alia, by temporarily suspending customs duties on imports of the products in question from third countries within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume.\n(4) The Spanish authorities submitted on 29 July 2004 and 19 July 2006 reports on implementation of the measures referred in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 704/2002 and requested the extension of those measures for the period 2007-13. The Commission has examined, on the basis of the aforementioned reports, the impact of the measures adopted on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands.\n(5) The reports provided by the Spanish authorities indicated that the quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 704/2002 were not exhausted.\n(6) Tariff quotas similar to those opened with Regulation (EC) No 704/2002 for certain fishery products are warranted because they would cover the needs of the Canary Islands\u2019 domestic market, while ensuring that flows of reduced-duty imports into the Community remain predictable and clearly identifiable.\n(7) Since the quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 704/2002 were not exhausted, it is appropriate to set the quantity of the quotas at a lower level.\n(8) In order to avoid undermining the integrity and the coherence of the internal market, measures should be taken to ensure that fishery products for which suspension is granted are intended solely for the Canary Islands\u2019 domestic market.\n(9) Measures must be taken to ensure that the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports in question so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any speculative movement or deflection of trade.\n(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission\u00a0(3).\n(11) Moreover, in order to ensure coherence with the scheme introduced by Regulation (EC) No 791/2007 the tariff quotas should be opened for the period 2007-13 and in order to ensure continuity with the measures set out in Regulation (EC) No 704/2002, it is appropriate to apply the measures provided for in this Regulation from 1 January 2007,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the fishery products listed in the Annex to this Regulation shall be suspended in full for the quantity indicated in that Annex.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suspension referred to in paragraph 1 shall be granted exclusively for products intended for the Canary Islands\u2019 domestic market.
