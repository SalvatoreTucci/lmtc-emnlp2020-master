Another undertaking (Arkema France SA) has informed the French competent authorities that there were major and manifest errors in the emissions data it reported to the Commission for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, with the result that its annual emissions were significantly underestimated. This data was used by the Commission as the basis for the calculation of the undertaking\u2019s limit as set out in the Annex to Decision 2010/372/EU, which lists the undertakings and the maximum quantities that may be emitted annually by each undertaking. The French competent authorities have investigated this claim and have found that such manifest errors in the reported data indeed exist. These errors in the reported data appear to be unintentional, and resulted in a limit being set for the undertaking that was significantly below the limit that would otherwise have been set had annual emissions been correctly reported. The undertaking\u2019s limit as set out in the Annex to Decision 2010/372/EU does not therefore correctly reflect its historical annual emissions and should be corrected.\n(4) The Annex to Decision 2010/372/EU should therefore be amended.\n(5) It should also be clarified that transfers of make-up quota between different substances and uses are also possible within the same undertaking.\n(6) Decision 2010/372/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) Decision 2010/372/EU is not limited in time and it may be appropriate to review it, and in particular its Annex, in the light of future technical developments.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009,", "main_body": ["Decision 2010/372/EU is amended as follows:\n(1) in Article 3, the first sentence is replaced by the following:\n(2) the Annex to Decision 2010/372/EU is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the following undertakings:\nAnwil SA\nUl.
