As a result, detailed rules for the administration of those quotas should be laid down.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products\u00a0(2) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences\u00a0(3) should apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/96 of 28 June 1996 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas in the poultry meat sector and albumin\u00a0(4) has been substantially amended several times and further changes are needed. Regulation (EC) No 1251/96 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(4) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, the quota period running from 1 July to 30 June the following year should be subdivided into several subperiods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.\n(5) The administration of the tariff quotas should be based on import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.\n(6) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the poultrymeat sector, clear conditions should be laid down as regards access for operators to the tariff quota scheme.\n(7) In order to ensure proper administration of the tariff quotas, the security for import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.\n(8) In the interests of the operators, the Commission should determine the quantities that have not been applied for, which will be added to the next quota subperiod in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01301/2006.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tariff quotas in Annex I are hereby opened for the import of poultrymeat products under the CN codes indicated therein.\nThe tariff quotas shall be open on an annual basis for the period from 1 July to 30 June the following year.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of products covered by the quotas referred to in paragraph 1, the applicable rate of customs duty, the order numbers and the group numbers shall be as set out in Annex I.", "The provisions of Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 and 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.", "The quantity set for the annual tariff quota period for each order number shall be subdivided into four subperiods, as follows:\n(a) 25 % from 1 July to 30 September;\n(b) 25 % from 1 October to 31 December;\n(c) 25 % from 1 January to 31 March;\n(d) 25 % from 1 April to 30 June.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, applicants for import licences shall, when submitting the first application for a given tariff quota period, provide proof that they imported or exported at least 50 tonnes of products covered by Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 in each of the two periods referred to in the said Article 5.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications may refer to only one of the order numbers indicated in Annex I to this Regulation. They may concern several products covered by different CN codes. If they do, all the CN codes and their designations must be entered in sections 16 and 15 respectively of the licence application and the licence.\nLicence applications must be for a minimum of 10 tonnes and a maximum of 10\u00a0% of the quantity available for the quota concerned in the subperiod in question.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications and licences shall contain the following entries:\n(a) in box 8, the name of the country of origin;\n(b) in box 20, one of the entries listed in Annex II, Part A;\nBox 24 of the licence shall contain one of the entries indicated in Annex II, Part B.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Licence applications shall be submitted only during the first seven days of the month preceding each subperiod referred to in Article 3.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A security of EUR 20 per 100 kilograms shall be lodged when an application for a licence is submitted.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, each applicant may submit several applications for import licences for products covered by a single order number, provided these products originate in different countries.
