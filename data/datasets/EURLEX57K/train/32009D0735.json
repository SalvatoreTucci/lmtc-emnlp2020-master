Ratu Epeli Nailatikau\nActing President of the Republic of the Fiji Islands\nSuva\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands\nExcellency,\nThe European Union attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Cotonou Agreement\u2019 and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EC partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which form the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, and form the basis of our relations.\nOn 11 December 2006 the Council of the European Union condemned the military takeover in Fiji.\nUnder Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and considering that the military takeover on 5 December 2006 constituted a violation of the essential elements listed in Article 9 of that Agreement, the European Union, hereinafter referred to as the \u2018EU\u2019, invited Fiji to consultations, as provided for in that Agreement, in order to thoroughly examine the situation and, where necessary, take steps to remedy it.\nThe formal part of those consultations began in Brussels on 18 April 2007. The EU was pleased that at the time the Interim Government confirmed a number of key commitments regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for democratic principles and the rule of law, as noted below, and proposed positive steps regarding their implementation.\nRegrettably, there have since been a series of regressive developments, in particular in April 2009, meaning that Fiji is now in breach of a range of its commitments. This concerns notably the abrogation of the Constitution, the very substantial delay in holding the parliamentary elections, and human rights violations. Although implementation of the commitments has been substantially delayed, the majority of those commitments remain highly relevant to Fiji\u2019s present situation, and are therefore annexed to this letter. As Fiji has decided to break a number of key commitments, this has led to losses for Fiji in terms of development funds.\nHowever, in the spirit of partnership forming the cornerstone of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU expresses its readiness to engage in new formal consultations as soon as there is a reasonable prospect for a positive conclusion to such consultations. The Interim Prime Minister has recently presented a roadmap for reforms and elections. The EU stands ready to engage in dialogue regarding this roadmap, and is prepared to consider whether it may serve as a basis for new consultations. Accordingly, the EU has decided to extend the existing appropriate measures for Fiji in order to create a window of opportunity for new consultations. While some of the appropriate measures are now out of date, it has been concluded that rather than update them unilaterally the EU prefers to further explore possibilities for new consultations with Fiji. Consequently, it is of particular importance that the Interim Government commits to an inclusive domestic political dialogue and to flexibility concerning the time frame for the coming roadmap. While the EU\u2019s position is and always will be guided by the essential elements of the revised Cotonou Agreement as well as its fundamental principles, notably regarding the pivotal role of dialogue and the fulfilment of mutual obligations, it is stressed that there are no foregone conclusions on the EU\u2019s side regarding the outcome of future consultations.\nIf new consultations result in substantial commitments from Fiji, the EU is committed to an early, positive review of these appropriate measures. Conversely, if the situation in Fiji does not improve, then further losses of development funds for Fiji are set to continue.\nUntil new consultations have taken place the EU invites Fiji to continue and intensify the enhanced political dialogue.\nThe appropriate measures are as follows:\n\u2014 humanitarian aid as well as direct support to civil society may continue,\n\u2014 cooperation activities under way and/or in preparation, in particular under the 8th and 9th European Development Funds, hereinafter referred to as \u2018EDF\u2019, may continue,\n\u2014 the 9th EDF End-of-term Review may proceed,\n\u2014 cooperation activities, which would help the return to democracy and improve governance, may be pursued, save under very exceptional circumstances,\n\u2014 implementation of the sugar reform accompanying measures for 2006 may proceed. The financing agreement was signed at the technical level by Fiji on 19 June 2007. It is noted that the financing agreement includes a suspension clause,\n\u2014 the Interim Government\u2019s acceptance on 19 June 2007 of the report of 7 June by the Pacific Islands Forum\u2019s independent election experts is in line with Commitment No 1 agreed on 18 April 2007 between the Interim Government and the EU. Consequently, the preparation and eventual signing of the multiannual indicative programme for sugar reform accompanying measures for 2008-2010 can proceed,\n\u2014 the finalisation, signing at the technical level and implementation of the Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for the 10th EDF with an indicative financial envelope, as well as the possible allocation of an incentive tranche of up to 25\u00a0% of this sum, will be subject to respect of the commitments made with regard to human rights and the rule of law; notably that the Interim Government upholds the Constitution, that the independence of the judiciary is fully respected and that the Public Emergency Regulations, reintroduced on 6 September 2007, are lifted as soon as possible, that all allegations of human rights infringements are investigated or dealt with in accordance with the various procedures and forums under the laws of the Fiji Islands and that the Interim Government shall use best endeavours to prevent statements by security agencies destined to intimidate,\n\u2014 the 2007 sugar allocation will be zero,\n\u2014 the 2008 sugar allocation will become available, subject to evidence of credible and timely preparation of elections in accordance with the agreed commitments; notably regarding census, redrafting of boundaries and electoral reform in accordance with the Constitution, that measures will be taken to ensure the functioning of the Elections Office, including the appointment by a Supervisor of Elections by 30 September 2007 in accordance with the Constitution,\n\u2014 the 2009 sugar allocation will become available subject to a legitimate government being in place,\n\u2014 the 2010 allocation will depend on progress made in implementing the 2009 sugar allocation and the continuation of the democratic process,\n\u2014 additional support for the preparation and implementation of key commitments, in particular in support of the preparation and/or holding of elections, could be considered over and above what is described in this letter,\n\u2014 regional cooperation, and Fiji\u2019s participation in it, is unaffected,\n\u2014 cooperation with the European Investment Bank and the Centre for the Development of Enterprise may continue subject to the timely fulfilment of commitments made.\nFollow-up of the commitments will be in accordance with the commitments on monitoring in terms of regular dialogue, cooperation with missions and reporting, as referred to in Annex.\nFurthermore, the EU expects Fiji to cooperate fully with the Pacific Islands Forum regarding the implementation of the recommendations by the Eminent Persons\u2019 Group, as endorsed by the Forum Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Vanuatu on 16 March 2007.\nThe European Union will continue to follow the situation in Fiji closely. Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, an enhanced political dialogue will be conducted with Fiji to ensure the respect for human rights, restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law until both parties conclude that the enhanced nature of dialogue has served its purpose.\nIf there is a slowing down, breakdown or reversal in the implementation by the Interim Government of the commitments made, the EU reserves the right to adjust the appropriate measures.\nThe EU stresses that Fiji\u2019s privileges in its cooperation with the EU depend on respect for the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and for the values referred to in the Development Cooperation Instrument. In order to convince the EU that the Interim Government is fully prepared to follow-up on the commitments given, it is essential that early and substantial progress is made in the fulfilment of the agreed commitments.\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council\nAnnex to the Annex\nAGREED COMMITMENTS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respect for Democratic Principles\nCommitment No 1\nThat free and fair parliamentary elections take place within 24 months from 1 March 2007 subject to the findings of the assessment to be carried out by the independent auditors appointed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.
