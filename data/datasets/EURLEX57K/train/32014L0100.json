Several satellite AIS initiatives have been launched, including by Member States, confirming the operational benefits from having access to SAT-AIS data.\n(7) The EMSA hosted systems and applications are able to provide Member States' authorities and Union bodies, comprehensive information on, for example, ship positions, dangerous cargoes, pollution, etc., as well as provide support services in areas such as coast guards, anti-piracy and, statistics, in accordance with the access rights attributed in compliance with the Interface and Functionalities Control Document (IFCD) established and maintained under Article 22a and Annex III of the Directive.\n(8) The management of the system and its technological enhancements are regularly discussed with Member States in the SafeSeaNet High Level Steering Group (HLSG) established by Commission Decision 2009/584/EC\u00a0(2). Improvements made resulting in the technical integration of the various systems and applications developed are also discussed by this group. These advancements and the testing of an integrated maritime data environment by the European Maritime Safety Agency have produced synergies, improved systems features and services.\n(9) Annex III to Directive 2002/59/EC should therefore be adapted to reflect these technical advancements made in light of experience gained with SafeSeaNet.\n(10) Annex III to the VTMIS Directive which covers the Union Maritime Information and Exchange system and refers to other relevant Union legislation, should be made more explicit by specifying those Union acts in regard to which SafeSeaNet is currently used, such as Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(3), Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(4), Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(5) and Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(6); in regard to the mentioned legal acts, the use of SafeSeaNet can further facilitate the exchange and sharing of information and should further facilitate the use of the system, the integrated information system and a platform to ensure the convergence and interoperability of maritime systems and applications, including space-based technologies.\n(11) The developments reflected in this Directive can also play a central role in the development of a Common Information and Sharing Environment (CISE) for the maritime domain, which is a voluntary collaborative process in the European Union seeking to further enhance and promote relevant information sharing between authorities involved in maritime surveillance.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS),", "main_body": ["Annex III to Directive 2002/59/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 18 November 2015 at the latest.
