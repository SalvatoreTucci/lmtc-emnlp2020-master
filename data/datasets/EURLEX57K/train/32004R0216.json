The market situation for potato starch, being particularly influenced by the minimum price for potatoes, can differ from that for cereal starch. It should therefore be possible to set a different refund for potato starch.\n(2) Applications for refund certificates can be lodged each working day before 3 p.m. Brussels time. As this time limit may fall after commencement of a meeting of the Management Committee for Cereals at which refund rates are being decided there is a risk of speculative applications. The time limit should therefore be brought forward.\n(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 stipulates that production refund certificates are valid until the last day of the fifth month following that of issue. This carries a risk that certificates will be issued for over-large volumes; since the Commission can neither reject certificate applications in the event of speculation nor set a different refund rate without consulting the Management Committee for Cereals, the validity of licences should be shortened to end on the last day of the third month following that of issue.\n(4) The Commission does not have detailed information on the quantities on which production refunds have been granted until three months after the end of each quarter of the calendar year. To make a better picture of the situation Member States should notify monthly the quantities of starch for which certificate applications have been made.\n(5) Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 should be amended accordingly.\n(6) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. In Article 3(2) the following subparagraph is added:\"For potato starch a different rate may be set that reflects the minimum price indicated in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.\"\n2. In Article 5(1) the second sentence is replaced by:\"Applications may be lodged every working day before 13.00 Brussels time.\"\n3. In Article 6(3) the first subparagraph is replaced by:\n\"3.
