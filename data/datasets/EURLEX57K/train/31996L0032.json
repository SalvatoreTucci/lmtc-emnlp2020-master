whereas certain of those provisions should be amended in the light of technical and scientific progress;\nWhereas the Commission has received a mandate in the framework of Directive 90/642/EEC to prepare the list of pesticide residues and their maximum levels for approval by the Council;\nWhereas Directive 90/642/EEC provided for the establishment of a list of maximum levels for certain pesticide residues, including a maximum pesticide residue level for the herbicide glyphosate in and on soya bean (3), and for the fungicide fenarimol in and on bananas (4); whereas it is appropriate to amend to maximum pesticide residue levels for soya bean and bananas in order to reflect the authorized uses in certain third countries; whereas the new levels provided for are acceptable from a dietary intake point of view; whereas these levels should facilitate international trade;\nWhereas Directive 90/642/EEC provided for the establishment of maximum pesticide residue levels for iprodione in and on rhubarb, and for benomyl in and on rhubarb and courgettes; whereas new data are available on these pesticide residue/product combinations; whereas on consideration of these data it is now appropriate to amend the maximum pesticide residue levels for rhubarb and courgettes; whereas the new levels provided for are acceptable from a dietary intake point of view;\nWhereas pesticide residues may arise in products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables as a result of agricultural practices; whereas it is necessary to take into account relevant data for both authorized pesticide uses and supervised trials;\nWhereas, in order better to estimate dietary intake of pesticide residues, it is prudent to establish simultaneously, where appropriate, maximum residue levels for individual pesticides in all major components of the diet; whereas these levels represent the use of minimum quantities of pesticide to achieve adequate control, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable;\nWhereas it is now appropriate that maximum levels be fixed for certain pesticide residues in products of plant origin, namely disulfoton, fenbutatin oxide, mecarbam, phorate, propyzamide, triazophos and triforine; whereas, however, it is not possible to establish maximum pesticide residue levels for all pesticide residue product combinations due to insufficient data;\nWhereas, however, data are insufficient by current standards to establish maximum pesticide residue levels for certain pesticide residue/product combinations; whereas, in such cases, a period of time not exceeding four years would seem reasonable for the generation of the necessary data; whereas, therefore, maximum levels should be established on the basis of such data by 30 April 2000 at the latest; whereas failure to provide satisfactory data should normally result in the establishment of levels at the appropriate limit of determination; whereas satisfactory undertakings to generate the necessary data must be given within one year of the adoption of this Directive;\nWhereas the maximum residue levels established in this Directive will have to be reviewed in the framework of the re-evalutation of active substances provided for in the work programme established in Article 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5),", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.
