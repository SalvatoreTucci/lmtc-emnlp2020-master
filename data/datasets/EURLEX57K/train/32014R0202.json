Those substances should now be added to the Union list of authorised substances as food contact material (FCM) substances Nos 872 and 988.\n(3) From the scientific evaluation of FCM substance No 988 it follows that migration of its hydrolysis product, 1,3-benzenedimethanamine should be controlled. 1,3-benzenedimethanamine is already authorised as FCM substance No 421. As the migration of FCM substances Nos 421 and 988 is controlled on the basis of the migration of FCM substance No 421, a group restriction including both substances should be introduced. Therefore, the authorisation of FCM substance No 421 should be amended and the group restriction introduced in Table 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011.\n(4) FCM substance No 340 (dicyanodiamide) is authorised as an additive in plastics in Table 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 without a specific migration limit. The Opinion reported in the 33rd series of the Scientific Committee for Food\u00a0(5) established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1\u00a0mg/kg body weight resulting in a specific migration limit (SML) of 60\u00a0mg/kg food. This limit coincides with the generic specific migration limit established in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. However, since the SML of 60\u00a0mg/kg is derived from a toxicological threshold such as the TDI, the SML should be specifically mentioned in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011.\n(5) In order to limit the administrative burden to business operators, plastic materials and articles which have been lawfully placed on the market based on the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and which do not comply with this Regulation should be able to be placed on the market until 24 March 2015. They should be able to remain on the market until exhaustion of stocks.\n(6) Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "Plastic materials and articles which have been lawfully placed on the market before 24 March 2014 and which do not comply with this Regulation may be placed on the market until 24 March 2015.
