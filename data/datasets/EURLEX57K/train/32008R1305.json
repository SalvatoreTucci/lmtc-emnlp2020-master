These practices ensure that the key characteristics of PDO products are maintained.\n(3) The Commission has examined the amendment in question and decided that it is justified. Since this concerns a minor amendment within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission may adopt it without following the procedure set out in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of that Regulation.\n(4) In accordance with Article 18(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006\u00a0(3) and pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, a summary of the specification should be published,", "main_body": ["The specification for the protected designation of origin \u2018Maroilles or Marolles\u2019 is hereby amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.", "A summary of the main points of the specification is given in Annex II to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 December 2008.\nFor the Commission\nMariann FISCHER BOEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 148, 21.6.1996, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 369, 23.12.2006, p. 1.\nANNEX I\nThe specification for the protected designation of origin \u2018Maroilles or Marolles\u2019 is amended as follows:\n\u2018Method of production\u2019\nThe following provisions are added to point 5 of the specifications regarding the production method:\n\u2018(\u2026) Coagulation may be carried out only using rennet.\nThe milk may not be concentrated by partially removing the watery part before coagulation.\nIn addition to the raw dairy materials, the only ingredients or production aids or additives authorised in the milk during production are rennet, innocuous bacterial cultures, yeasts, moulds, calcium chloride and salt.\n(\u2026) The dairy raw materials, partly finished products, curd and fresh cheese may not be conserved at a temperature below 0\u00a0\u00b0C.\n(\u2026) Fresh cheese and cheese undergoing the maturing process may not be conserved under a modified atmosphere.\u2019\nANNEX II\nSUMMARY\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs\n\u2018MAROILLES or MAROLLES\u2019\nEC No: FR-PDO-0117-0123/29.03.2006\nPDO (X)\u00a0PGI (\u00a0)\nThis summary sets out the main elements of the product specification for information purposes.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsible department in the Member State\nName: Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress: 51, rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris\nTel. +33 (0)1 53 89 80 00\nFax: +33 (0)1 53 89 80 60\nE-mail: info@inao.gouv.fr\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Group\nName: Syndicat des fabricants et affineurs du fromage de Maroilles\nAddress: Uriane, BP 20, 148 avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-de-Gaulle, 02260 La Capelle\nTel. +33 (0)3 23 97 57 57\nFax: +33 (0)3 23 97 57 59\nE-mail: sfam@uriane.com\nComposition: Producers/processors (X)\u00a0Other (\u00a0)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of product\nClass 1.3 \u2014 Cheeses\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specification\n(summary of requirements under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006)\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name\n\u2018Maroilles or Marolles\u2019\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description\nMade from cow\u2019s milk, this is a soft cheese with a washed red to orange rind, 12,5 to 13 cm square in shape but with also three other smaller formats (Sorbais, Mignon and Quart);

All operators must keep at the INAO\u2019s disposal their registers and any documents required for checking the origin, quality and production conditions of the milk and cheese.\nAs part of the checks carried out on the specified features of the designation of origin, an analytical and organoleptic test is conducted to ensure that the products submitted for examination are of high quality and possess the requisite typical characteristics.\n4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of production\nThe milk must be produced, and the cheese must be manufactured and matured, within the geographical area.\nCheese made exclusively from renneted cow\u2019s milk; the curd is separated and not washed; it is left to drain naturally; the cheese is dry salted; maturing is variable depending on the size, at least five weeks for the standard size, during which the rind is washed several times in salt water without using fungicides.\n4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link\nThe monks of the Abbaye of Maroilles, founded in the seventh century, perfected the production method for this cheese around 960. From the 11th century, the right to produce the cheese was extended to the neighbouring villages. The abbots improved the breed of cattle in line with the climate and cheese production. The designation was legally recognised on 17 July 1955.\nThis designation originates in the natural region of Thi\u00e9rache, around the town of Maroilles and its abbey, with its cool and damp climate, and impermeable soil that produces such good grass that the cattle are exclusively grass-fed. The monks\u2019 know-how, passed on to the surrounding population, has allowed the Maroilles to develop harmoniously.\n4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inspection body\nName: Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO)\nAddress: 51, rue d\u2019Anjou, 75008 Paris\nTel. +33 (0)1 53 89 80 00\nFax: +33 (0)1 53 89 80 60\nE-mail: info@inao.gouv.fr\nThe Institut national de l\u2019origine et de la qualit\u00e9 is a public administrative body with legal personality and reports to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nIt is responsible for monitoring the production conditions for products with a designation of origin.\nName: Directorate-General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Prevention (DGCCRF)\nAddress: 59, boulevard Vincent Auriol, 75703 Paris Cedex 13\nTel. +33 (0)1 44 87 17 17\nFax: +33 (0)1 44 97 30 37\nThe DGCCRF is a department of the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment.\n4.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling\nThe product must bear the name of the designation of origin."}
