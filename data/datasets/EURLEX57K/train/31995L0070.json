For the purposes of this Directive, the definitions laid down in Article 2 of  Directive 91/67/EEC and Article 2 of Directive 91/492/EEC (4) shall apply as necessary.\n2. In addition, 'observed abnormal mortality' shall mean sudden mortality affecting approximately  15 % of stocks and occurring over a short period between two inspections (confirmed within 15  days). In hatchery a mortality shall be considered abnormal when the farmer cannot obtain larvae  during a period which included successive spawns from different broodstocks. In nursery a mortality  shall be considered abnormal when a sudden sizeable mortality occurs in a short time on a number of  tubes.", "Member States shall ensure that all farms rearing bivalve molluscs:\n1. are registered by the official service; this registration must be kept constantly up to date;\n2. keep a record of:\n(a) live bivalve molluscs entering the farm, containing all information relating to their delivery,  their number or weight, their size and their origin;\n(b) bivalve molluscs leaving the farm for reimmersion, containing all information relating to their  dispatch, their number or weight, their size and destination;\n(c) observed abnormal mortality.\nThis record, which shall be open to scrutiny by the official service at all times, on demand, shall  be updated regularly and kept for four years.", "1. Member States shall ensure that a monitoring and sampling programme is applied in  bivalve mollusc farms, farming areas and harvested natural beds in order to observe whether there  is an abnormal mortality and keep track of the health situation of stocks.\nIn addition, the official service may apply the above programme to purification centres and storage  tanks which discharge water into the sea.\nIf, during application of this programme, any abnormal mortality is observed, or if the official  service has information giving it reason to suspect the presence of diseases, the following  measures shall be taken:\n- a list shall be drawn up of the sites where the diseases referred to in Annex A, list II to  Directive 91/67/EEC are present, provided that such diseases are not the subject of a programme  approved pursuant to the aforementioned Directive,\n- a list shall be drawn up of the sites at which abnormal mortality has been observed as a result  of the presence of the diseases referred to in Annex D, or on which the official service has  information giving it reason to suspect the presence of diseases,\n- monitoring of the evolution and geographical spread of the diseases referred to in the first and  second indents.\n2. The detailed rules for implementing this Article, and inter alia the rules to be applied for  establishing the programme referred to in paragraph 1, particularly as regards the frequency and  timetable of monitoring, procedures for taking samples (statistically representative volume) and  methods of diagnosis, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article  10.", "1. Member States shall ensure that the suspected presence of any diseases referred to  in Article 4 and any abnormal mortality rate observed in bivalve molluscs in farms, in farming  areas or in harvested natural beds or in purification centres or storage tanks which discharge  water into the sea is notified as soon as possible to the official service by the shellfish-farmers  or any other person who has made such observations.\n2. In the case referred to in paragraph 1, the official service in the Member States shall ensure  that:\n(a) samples are taken for examination in an approved laboratory;\n(b) pending the result of the examination referred to in (a), no molluscs leave the affected farm,  farming area or harvested natural beds or purification centres or storage tanks which discharge  water into the sea for relaying or reimmersion in another farm or in the aquatic environment,  unless authorized by the official service.\n3. If the examination referred to in paragraph 2 (a) fails to demonstrate the presence of a  pathogen, the restrictions referred to in paragraph 2 (b) shall be lifted.\n4. If the examination referred to in paragraph 2 shows the presence of a pathogen causing the  observed abnormal mortality capable of being the cause of that mortality, or of a pathogen of one  of the diseases referred to in Article 4, an epizootic investigation must be carried out by the  official service in order to determine the possible means of contamination and to investigate  whether molluscs have left the farm, the farming area or the harvested natural beds for relaying or  reimmersion elsewhere during the period preceding observation of the abnormal mortality.\nIf the epizootic investigation shows that the disease has been introduced into one or more farms,  farming areas or harvested natural beds as a result inter alia of molluscs being moved, the  provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply.\nHowever, by way of derogation from Article 3 (1) (c) of Directive 91/67/EEC, the official service  may, within its territory, authorize the movement of live bivalve molluscs to other farms, farming  areas or harvested natural beds which are infected with the same disease.\nIf necessary, further appropriate measures may be decided on in accordance with the procedure in  Article 10.\n5. The official service shall ensure that the Commission and the other Member States are  immediately informed, in accordance with the current Community procedures, of any cases of abnormal  mortality rates observed involving a pathogen, of any measures taken to analyse and control the  situation and of the cause of the mortality.", "1.
