These health measures were introduced following findings of certain residues of antibiotics in the meat products that, according to the Russian competent authorities, are not permissible.\n(5) The health measures have negatively affected the possibilities for exportation of pigmeat under the terms of Regulation (EC) No 1518/2003 and consequently the measures have seriously affected the activity of the exporters concerned and the possibilities in due time to fulfil their obligations as regard the Community rules.\n(6) Therefore, in order to limit the adverse impact on exporters, it is necessary to provide that, under certain conditions, derogation should be made from Regulation (EC) No\u00a01518/2003 and the validity of export licences should be prolonged by 120 days and that, at the request of interested parties, and pursuant to Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 376/2008, the security should be released by the Member States on a case-by-case basis.\n(7) The exceptional measures proposed in this Regulation should apply only to export licences that were valid at least one of the days from 25 April 2008 to 7 May 2008. All exporters of pigmeat should have become aware, by 2 May 2008, of the practical difficulties that exports to Russia were facing.\n(8) On the date of entering into force of this Regulation, part of licences that were valid at least one of the days from 25 April 2008 to 7 May 2008 has already expired. In order to ensure an equal treatment of the interested parties, it should be provided for the retroactive application to all licences valid in this period.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For export licences issued in accordance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01518/2003 that were valid at least one of the days from 25 April 2008 to 7 May 2008:\n(a) by way of derogation from Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1518/2003, the period of validity shall be prolonged by 120 days;\n(b) pursuant to Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 376/2008, at the request of interested parties made no later than 30 November 2008, the export licences shall be cancelled and the securities released proportionally by the competent authorities of the Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measure provided for in paragraph 1(b) shall only apply in cases where the exporter invokes rules imposed by a third country that are considered by the competent authorities of the Member State to constitute force majeure in accordance with Articles 39 and 40 of Regulation (EC) No 376/2008.
