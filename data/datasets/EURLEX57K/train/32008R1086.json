These reference levels have been established by the Commission in Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003 laying down implementing rules on the Community Fleet Policy as defined in Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002\u00a0(2).\n(2) According to Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003, that Regulation applies to the fishing capacity of Community vessels with the exception of vessels which are exclusively used in aquaculture or registered in the outermost regions of France, Portugal and Spain.\n(3) Footnote 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003 stipulates that the reference levels may be revised to take into account vessels that existed on 31 December 2002 but were either not covered by MAGP IV or not registered on the date the table of the Annex was prepared.\n(4) On 26 September 2006, the Netherlands informed the Commission that a number of vessels, whose capacity is currently included in the reference level for that Member State, are exclusively used for aquaculture and requested the Commission to decrease the reference level for the total fishing capacity of the Community fishing vessels flying the Dutch flag by 15\u00a0540\u00a0GT and 39\u00a0258\u00a0kW.\n(5) The current reference level for the Irish fleet does not include part of the small-scale vessels targeting mainly non-quota species. Although the capacity for these vessels had been included in the objectives of MAGP IV, the registration of these vessels had not been completed at the time of establishing the reference levels. On 4 April 2008, Ireland submitted to the Commission the final list of vessels and requested the Commission to amend the reference level for the Irish fleet accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to take account of the fishing capacity of mussel dredgers which were previously not registered. Consequently, the reference levels for Ireland should be increased by 1\u00a0719\u00a0GT and 14\u00a0608\u00a0kW.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 November 2008.\nFor the Commission\nJoe BORG\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 204, 13.8.2003, p. 21.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX I\nReference levels by Member State\u00a0(1)\nMember State Reference levels\nR(GT) 03 R(kW) 03\nBelgium 23\u00a0372 67\u00a0857\nDenmark 132\u00a0706 459\u00a0526\nGermany 84\u00a0262 175\u00a0927\nGreece 119\u00a0910 653\u00a0497\nSpain (excluding the capacity registered in the Canary Islands at 31 December 2002) 728\u00a0344 1\u00a0671\u00a0739\nFrance (excluding the MAGP IV objectives for the segments of the French Overseas Departments) 230\u00a0257 920\u00a0969\nIreland 88\u00a0700 244\u00a0834\nItaly 229\u00a0862 1\u00a0338\u00a0971\nNetherlands 197\u00a0599 487\u00a0809\nPortugal (excluding the MAGP IV objectives for the segments of Azores and Madeira) 171\u00a0502 412\u00a0025\nFinland 23\u00a0203 216\u00a0195\nSweden 51\u00a0993 261\u00a0028\nUnited Kingdom 286\u00a0120 1\u00a0129\u00a0194\nTotal 2\u00a0367\u00a0830 8\u00a0039\u00a0571\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The levels of reference may be revised to take into account vessels that existed on 31 December 2002 but were either not covered by MAGP IV or not registered on the date this table was prepared.\u2019"}
