Moreover, the use of ETD and HHMD may facilitate the screening process and be experienced to be a less intrusive means of screening than a hand search, thus constituting an improvement in the experience of persons screened.\n(4) It is thus useful and justified to allow these methods for screening of those parts of the person where a hand search is considered inefficient and/or undesirable such as certain headgear, plaster casts or prosthesis.\n(5) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the human dignity, the freedom of religion, the non-discrimination, the rights of persons with disabilities, and the right to liberty and security. In so far as it limits those rights and principles, such limitation is made genuinely to meet objectives of general interest and the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others, respecting the conditions laid down in Article 52 of the Charter. This Regulation must be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(6) Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010\u00a0(3) should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security set up by Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 4 February 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 97, 9.4.2008, p. 72.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 91, 3.4.2009, p. 7.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 55, 5.3.2010, p. 1.\nANNEX\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1) letter (f) is added to point 1.3.1.1 as follows:\n\u2018(f) explosive trace detection (ETD) equipment combined with hand held metal detection (HHMD) equipment.\u2019;\n(2) point 1.3.1.2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.3.1.2.
