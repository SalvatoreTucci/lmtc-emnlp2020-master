whereas Article 67 (1) of the ECSC Treaty provides that such actions must be brought to the knowledge of the High Authority by the State concerned;\nWhereas the Commission is responsible for ascertaining whether aids granted by Member States for the iron and steel industry fall under the provisions of Article 4 (c) and, if not, how such aids must be looked upon having regard to the provisions of Article 67 (2) and (3) of the ECSC Treaty;\nWhereas Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the Treaty place the Member States under the obligation to supply all relevant information which the Commission needs to carry out its task in a particular sector;\nWhereas if information concerning the aids in question is provided in the form of an annual total, it is not possible to ascertain, for each grant of aid to the iron and steel industry, whether the conditions applied are identical to those applied in respect of other industries to which the same measures of aid are extended;\nWhereas the Commission, by letter of 12 March 1970, No 70-22229, requested the Kingdom of Belgium to inform it of the measures already taken to aid the steel industry and of the aid proposed for the iron and steel industry under general aid measures;\nWhereas on 13 May 1971 the Commission addressed a further letter, No 71-23837, to the Kingdom of Belgium, since the latter had not replied to letter No 70-22229 of 12 March 1970;\nWhereas the letter of 13 May 1971 invited the Kingdom of Belgium to supply detailed information within two months on aids granted for individual iron and steel investments during 1970 ; amount of credit and/or subsidy, duration, rate of interest, deferred amortization and tax concessions;\nWhereas the Kingdom of Belgium was also invited within two months to complete the list of aids granted to the iron and steel industry by answering a number of questions;\nWhereas that letter clearly reaffirmed that where general or regional measures of aid in favour of investment projects for the iron and steel industry are applied, the Commission has to be informed thereof ; whereas the Member States cannot escape that obligation on the grounds that general systems of aid  cannot be subject to a specific examination under the provisions of the Treaty of Paris;\nWhereas the Belgian State forwarded, by letter of 14 July 1971, information to complete the list of aid to the iron and steel industry ; whereas that Member State has however not forwarded the information on investment asked for in the Commission's letter of 13 May 1971;\nWhereas the Commission had allowed two months for the provision of this information, which should be sufficient time for the purpose;\nWhereas the provision of incomplete information and failure to communicate certain information requested by the Commission in the letters of 12 March 1970 and 13 May 1971 constitute, in the opinion of the Commission, a failure to fulfil the obligations which devolve upon the Belgian State under Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the ECSC Treaty;\nWhereas by letter No 72-20061 of 6 January 1972 the Commission invited the Kingdom of Belgium in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 88 to furnish within two months from the date of that letter its comments with regard to the failure in question;\nWhereas in its reply of 22 February 1972 the Kingdom of Belgium declared that it had furnished the information requested by the Commission including the information on investment aids asked for in the Commission's letter of 13 May 1971 ; whereas such information has however not been supplied;\nWhereas Article 88 provides that the Commission shall set the State concerned a time limit for the fulfilment of its obligation,", "main_body": ["The Kingdom of Belgium by not providing certain information requested by the Commission in its letters No 71-23837 of 13 May 1971 and No 72-20061 of 6 January 1972 has failed to fulfil an obligation devolving upon it under Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the ECSC Treaty.", "The Kingdom of Belgium is hereby given a time limit of two months to fulfil the obligation in question.", "This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 July 1972.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nS.L.
