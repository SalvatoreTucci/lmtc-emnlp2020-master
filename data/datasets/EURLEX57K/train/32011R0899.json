The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.\n(2) According to the information provided by Ireland in respect of the period 1\u00a0January to 31\u00a0December 2010, the average ageing period for Irish whiskey in 2010 was 5 years.\n(3) The coefficients for the period 1\u00a0October 2011 to 30\u00a0September 2012 should therefore be fixed accordingly.\n(4) Article\u00a010 of Protocol\u00a03 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Union has concluded agreements abolishing export refunds with certain third countries.
