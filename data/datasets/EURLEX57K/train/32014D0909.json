It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and capable of multiplying rapidly in the presence of bee brood and comb honey. Adult specimens can fly up to several kilometres to invade other such places. The small hive beetle is a notifiable disease in the Union under Council Directive 92/65/EEC\u00a0(3).\n(2) On 11 September 2014, Italy informed the Commission of the occurrence of the small hive beetle in a nucleus colony, set up by a University department located in the region of Calabria.\n(3) Italy immediately put in place measures in order to eradicate and prevent the spread of the small hive beetle, as well as to survey the extent of the occurrence of that parasite in the areas surrounding the outbreak in Calabria. In particular, a protection zone with a 20 km radius and a surveillance zone with a 100 km radius from the site of the outbreak were established. The areas of a 100 km radius also concern the provinces of Messina and Catania in Sicily.\n(4) After discovering the occurrence of the small hive beetle in other apiaries close to the site of the first occurrence, Italy extended the measures, including the establishment of a surveillance zone and a ban on the movement of honey bees and bumblebees (Bombus spp.) to cover the whole region of Calabria.\n(5) Since the date of the first occurrence of the small hive beetle in Calabria, another 35 occurrences have been confirmed in apiaries located in close proximity in the protection zone of 20 km radius. Controls carried out in other parts of Calabria have so far given negative results for the presence of the parasite.\n(6) On 7 November 2014, Italy informed about a new occurrence of small hive beetle in the Sicilian province of Siracusa which is located outside the areas previously under restriction. The occurrence was detected in an apiary which was moved from the protection zone in Calabria at the end of August 2014, before the implementation of the restrictive measures.\n(7) In all positive cases, the affected apiaries have been destroyed; however, the spread of the small hive beetle from the affected area in Italy could constitute a serious hazard to honey bees and bumblebees in the Union.\n(8) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, as well as to prevent the spread of the small hive beetle to other parts of the Union, it is necessary to establish at Union level a list of the areas in Italy that should be subject to certain movement restrictions for commodities in relation to the occurrence of the small hive beetle.\n(9) In addition these areas need to be taken into account as reference also in intra-EU trade certification as the health certificate for trade in bees and bumblebees set out in Part 2 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC states that they must come from an area of at least 100 km radius which is not the subject of any restrictions associated with the suspicion or confirmed occurrence of the small hive beetle and where such infestations are absent.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision should be reviewed in the light of the evolution of the epidemiological situation of the small hive beetle in Italy within a period of eight months from the date of adoption of this Decision.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["This Decision lays down the protective measures to be taken by Italy following the confirmed occurrences of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) in honey bees (Apis mellifera), in the areas listed in the Annex.", "For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall
