As regards the foodstuffs not yet covered by Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, it was considered necessary and appropriate for the protection of public health to establish maximum levels for ochratoxin A in those foodstuffs that are a significant contributor to the exposure of OTA (for the whole population, or for vulnerable group of the population, or for significant part of the population) or for those foodstuffs that are not necessarily a significant contributor to the exposure of OTA, but there is evidence that there can be found a very high level of OTA in these commodities. A maximum level is appropriate to be set in these cases to avoid that those very highly contaminated commodities could enter the food chain.\n(5) On the basis of the information available, it does not appear necessary for the protection of public health to set a maximum level of OTA in dried fruit other than dried vine fruit, cocoa and cocoa products, meat products, including edible offal and blood products and liqueur wines as they are not a significant contributor to OTA exposure and high levels of OTA have been found only seldom in those commodities. In the case of green coffee and beer, the presence of OTA is already controlled at another more appropriate stage of the production chain (respectively roasted coffee and malt).\n(6) Very high levels of OTA have been observed at several occasions in spices and liquorice. It is therefore appropriate to set a maximum level for spices and liquorice.\n(7) There is recent evidence that in some main producing countries of spices exporting to the Union no prevention measures and official controls are in place to control the presence of ochratoxin A in spices. In order to protect public health, it is appropriate to establish without delay a maximum level for ochratoxin A in spices. To enable the producing countries to put prevention measures in place and not to disrupt trade to an unacceptable extent, a higher maximum level, applicable within short notice, is established for a limited period of time, before the maximum level reflecting the level achievable by applying good practices enters into application. It is appropriate that an assessment of the achievability in the different producing regions in the world of the levels for ochratoxin A by applying good practices takes place before the stricter level applies.\n(8) It is appropriate to continue the monitoring of OTA in foodstuffs for which no maximum level has been set and in the case of regular findings of unusually high levels of OTA, setting of a maximum level for OTA in those foodstuffs might be considered as appropriate.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is amended as follows:\n1. point 2.2.11 is replaced by the following points:\n\u20182.2.11.
