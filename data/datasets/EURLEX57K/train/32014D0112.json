For surface water, all monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 50\u00a0mg/l and more than 99\u00a0% of monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 25\u00a0mg/l.\n(8) The number of livestock and the utilisation of chemical fertilisers decreased over the last number of years. Cattle, pig and sheep numbers decreased respectively by 4\u00a0%, 11\u00a0% and 22\u00a0% from the period 2004-2007 to the period 2008-2011. Average nitrogen loading from livestock manure in the period 2008-2011 was 105\u00a0kg/ha, with a decline of 8\u00a0% compared to 2004-2007. Phosphorus average loading in the period 2008-2011 was 15\u00a0kg/ha, with a decline of 6\u00a0% compared to 2004-2007. Average chemical N fertiliser use decreased by 6\u00a0% in the period 2008-2011 compared to 2004-2007. Average chemical P fertiliser use decreased by 31\u00a0% in the period 2008-2011 compared to 2004-2007.\n(9) In Ireland, 93\u00a0% of agricultural land is devoted to grassland. Overall, in grassland farms, 47\u00a0% of the land area is farmed extensively and has therefore a relatively low stocking rate and low fertiliser inputs, 32\u00a0% is farmed under agro-environmental programmes and only 5,2\u00a0% is farmed intensively. 7\u00a0% is used for arable agriculture. The average chemical fertiliser use on grassland is 81\u00a0kg/ha nitrogen and 7\u00a0kg/ha phosphorus.\n(10) The Irish climate, characterised by an annual rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year and a relatively narrow annual temperature range promote a long grass-growing season ranging from 330 days per year in the south-west to around 250 days per year in the north-east.\n(11) The Commission, after examination of the request from Ireland, having considered the Irish action programme and in the light of the experience gained from the derogation provided for in Decision 2007/697/EC as amended by Decision 2011/127/EU considers that the amount of manure proposed by Ireland, corresponding to 250\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.\n(12) The supporting information presented by Ireland shows that the proposed amount of 250\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare per year on farms with at least 80\u00a0% grassland is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as high net precipitation, long growing seasons and high yields of grass with high nitrogen uptake.\n(13) The Decision 2007/697/EC as amended by Decision 2011/127/EU has an expiration date of 31 December 2013. For the purpose of ensuring that the farmers concerned may continue to benefit from the derogation, it is appropriate to adopt this Decision.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,", "main_body": ["The derogation requested by Ireland in a letter of 4 October 2013, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.", "Definitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) \u2018grassland farms\u2019 means holdings where 80\u00a0% or more of the agricultural area available for manure application is grass;\n(b) \u2018grazing livestock\u2019 means cattle (with the exclusion of veal calves), sheep, deer, goats and horses;\n(c) \u2018grass\u2019 means permanent grassland or temporary grassland (temporary implying leys of less than four years);\n(d) \u2018parcel\u2019 means an individual field or a group of fields, homogeneous regarding cropping, soil type and fertilisation practices.", "Scope\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis to grassland farms and subject to the conditions prescribed in Articles 4, 5 and 6.", "Annual application and commitment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farmers who want to benefit from a derogation under this Decision shall submit an application to the competent authority annually.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the annual application referred to in paragraph 1, they shall undertake in writing to fulfil the conditions provided for in Articles 5 and 6.", "Application of manure and other fertilisers\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of livestock manure from grazing livestock applied to the land each year on grassland farms, including by the animals themselves, shall not exceed the amount of manure containing 250\u00a0kg nitrogen per hectare, subject to the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total nitrogen inputs shall not exceed the foreseeable nutrient demand of the considered crop, shall take into account the supply from the soil, and shall not exceed the maximum fertilisation rate applicable to the farm, established in the Nitrates Action Programme.
