Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC\u00a0(2).\n(2) 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 was authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive without a time limit for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 255/2005\u00a0(3). That additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(3) That feed additive was also authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 for 10 years for ducks by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1500/2007 of 18 December 2007 concerning the authorisation of a new use of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 (Ronozyme) as a feed additive\u00a0(4).\n(4) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use on poultry species and porcine species, not covered previously, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(5) New data were submitted to support the application. The European Food Safety Authority (\u2018the Authority\u2019) concluded in its opinion of 6 October 2010\u00a0(5) that, under the proposed conditions of use, 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the digestibility of phosphorus. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n(6) The assessment of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(7) As a consequence of a new authorisation being granted by this Regulation, the entry for 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 in Regulation (EC) No 255/2005 should be deleted.\n(8) In the interest of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1500/2007 should be repealed.\n(9) Since the modifications to the conditions of the authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of pre-mixtures and compound feed.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The preparation specified in the Annex, belonging to the additive category \u2018zootechnical additives\u2019 and to the functional group \u2018digestibility enhancers\u2019, is authorised as an additive in animal nutrition, subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.", "In Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 255/2005, the entry EC No: 1614(i), additive: 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26, is deleted.", "Regulation (EC) No 1500/2007 is repealed.", "Pre-mixtures and compound feed containing 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 which are labelled in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 255/2005 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.\nPre-mixtures and compound feed containing 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 which are labelled in accordance with Regulations (EC) No 1831/2003 and (EC) No 1500/2007 may continue to be placed on the market and used until the existing stocks are exhausted.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 23 February 2011.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 29.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 45, 16.2.2005, p. 3.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 333, 19.12.2007, p. 54.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2010; 8(10):1862.\nANNEX\nIdentification number of the additive Name of the holder of authorisation Additive Composition, chemical formula, description, analytical method Species or category of animal Maximum age Minimum content Maximum content Other provisions End of period of authorisation\nUnits of activity/kg of complete feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12\u00a0%\nCategory of zootechnical additives.
