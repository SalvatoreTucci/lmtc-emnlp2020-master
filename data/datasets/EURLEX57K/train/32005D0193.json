It will reduce its production with a view to being in compliance with the rules laid down by Community legislation for establishments with limited capacity. Therefore it should be deleted from the list of establishments in transition.\n(4) Three meat establishments on the list of establishments in transition have made considerable efforts to build new facilities. However, those establishments are not in a position to finish their upgrading process by the prescribed deadline due to exceptional technical constraints. Therefore it is justified to allow them further time to complete the upgrading process.\n(5) The Annex to Decision 2004/475/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
