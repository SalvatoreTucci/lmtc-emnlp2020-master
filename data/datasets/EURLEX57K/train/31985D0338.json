CONTENT OF THE PROGRAMME\nThe programme will provide results which will be of direct use in implementing the Community's environmental policy and make it possible to judge the advisability of going ahead with the establishment of an information system on the state of the environment in the Community.\nIn this connection, account should be taken, in particular, of whether all existing possibilities for obtaining data can be fully exploited, in order to avoid any duplication and ensure the most economical approach possible.\nThe following activities are not listed in order of priority. Their complementary character implies that, in practice, all such work will be carried out concurrently.\nA. Priority application of the programme to Community-scale problems\n(a) Biotopes of major importance for nature conservation\nThe aim is to identify and describe biotopes of major importance for nature conservation in the Community.\nThe work will be based, on the one hand, on the preliminary results of the test study 'Biotopes of significance for nature conservation', in particular on its conclusions concerning the criteria for selecting biotopes and the characteristics to be adopted in describing them and, on the other hand, on the scientific knowledge acquired as a result of the activities of international organizations in this field.\nWork will be carried out in close coordination with the Council of Europe.\n(b) Acid deposition\nThe aim is to contribute to the solution of the problem of local and transfrontier atmospheric pollution commonly referred to as 'acid rain'.\nThe work will aim at collating and making consistent the data produced by schemes already under way at Community level or in other bodies (in particular, the OECD and the Economic Commission for Europe) as well as detecting sectors in which data are inadequate and providing an information base for drawing up proposals likely to contribute towards combating the phenomenon of acid rain.\nWork will focus:\n- firstly, on gathering and organizing consistent information on emissions into the air at Community level,\n- secondly, on making use of the whole range of research carried out in this field in order to give an overall picture at Community level of the distribution and extent of both actual and potential damage (irrespective of its origin) in the case of biotopes and soils.\n(c) Protection of the environment in the Mediterranean region\nThe aim is to gather and organize consistent information concerning the environmental resources and characteristics most directly affected by development programmes. Particularly those resulting from the implementation of Community policies in the Mediterranean region of the Community.\nWork will focus on land use and quality, soil erosion, water quality and resources and seismic risks, as well as the problems of coastal areas. B. Improvement in the comparability and availability of data and in the methods of analyzing data in order to ensure the consistency of results at Community level\n(a) Comparability and availability of environmental data collected in the Member States and at international level\n- organization of a process of mutual exchange of information on work under way or envisaged and the setting up of an inventory of sources, categories and definitions of data and information systems on the environment which will be updated at regular intervals,\n- transfrontier projects intended to improve the comparability of data,\n- support given to the work of Member States or international organizations in order to improve the availability of comparable data on a Community scale.\n(b) Data analysis methods\n- choice of methods of processing remote sensing data,\n- choice of computer techniques for the management of information on the state of the environment in the Community and for ensuring the consistency of national or regional information systems.\nII. GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMME\nA. The programme will be implemented following, where appropriate, the guidelines set out in the Commission communication to the Council entitled 'A methodological approach to an information system on the state of the environment and the natural resources in the European Community'.\nThe methodological approach is characterized, in particular, by:\n- observance of the principles of consistency, flexibility, transparency, scientific rigour and cost-effectiveness,\n- a modular structure enabling the information base to be built up progressively and to be adopted to advances in knowledge,\n- the acquisition of information enabling the state of the environment to be described from three points of view: the quality and sensitivity of the environment and the pressures on it,\n- the limitation of the Community data base to information needed to implement the Community's environmental policy,\n- the use of information techniques for the storage, collection and preliminary processing of data as well as public access to the basic data for the purpose of scientific checks.\nB. Assisted by the Committee referred to in Article 1 of the Decision, the Commission will define the exact nature of the data to be collected, the collection procedures and the data-processing methods.\nIn order to facilitate communications between experts, the various bodies concerned and the Commission, in particular as regards access to data, Member States will inform the Commission of the person(s) or body (bodies) able to assist in such liaison.\nIII. USE AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION\nA. Use of information\nInformation on the state of the environment, generated by the programme, should be usable in implementing environmental policies at Community level and also at national and regional levels as well as in informing public opinion.\nB. Dissemination of information\nThe information will be made public, subject to its compliance with the rules of the Commission and Member States on the dissemination of information, particularly with regard to confidentiality."}
