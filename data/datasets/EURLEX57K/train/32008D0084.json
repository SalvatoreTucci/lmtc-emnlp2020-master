By letter dated 25 October 2007, the Commission notified the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland that it had all the information necessary to consider the requests.\n(3) The purpose of the special measure is, for supplies of goods or services and intra-Community acquisitions of goods intended for the construction and maintenance of the cross-border bridges, the bridges, and its construction site in case of building, should be regarded as being entirely within the territory of one of the Member States in accordance with an agreement concluded between them on the division of responsibility for the construction or maintenance of those cross-border bridges.\n(4) In the absence of a special measure, it would be necessary, for each supply of goods or services or intra-Community acquisition of goods, to ascertain whether the place of taxation was the Federal Republic of Germany or the Republic of Poland.
