This exceptional situation has resulted in an exceptionally low average yield.\n(3) Some producers are in severe financial difficulties as a result.\n(4) This being the case in Portugal, and in view of the budgetary situation, that country should be authorised to make, before 16 November 2001, advance payments of area aid for cereals other than maize and advance payments of set-aside aid for the 2001/02 marketing year.\n(5) In the case of Spain, the exceptional weather conditions have sharply reduced yields in the \"secano\" regions, causing particularly severe financial difficulties for the producers operating under the simplified system as referred to in Article 6(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999, most of whom are small producers.\n(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,", "main_body": ["1.
