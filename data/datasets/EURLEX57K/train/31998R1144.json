whereas management measures should be laid down relating to the importation of these animals;\nWhereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by traders to this part of the quota; whereas there should be provision to correct any harm caused;\nWhereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for traders able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas, in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported and/or imported during 1997 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable;\nWhereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is registered for VAT purposes;\nWhereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to traders no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 June 1998;\nWhereas, to ensure orderly importation of the quantities laid down for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, the issue of the licences should be staggered over the year of import;\nWhereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences;
