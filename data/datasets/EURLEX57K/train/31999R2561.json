Regulation No 58 of the Commission(3) laying down common quality standards for certain products listed in Annex IB to Regulation No 23, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 888/97(4), has been the subject of multiple amendments and no longer ensures legal clarity.\n(2) The rules in question should therefore be recast and Annex I.3 to Regulation No 58 deleted. To that end, for reasons of trnsparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard recommended for peas by the Working Party on standardisation of perishable produce and quality development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).\n(3) The effect of these standards must be to remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, gear production to satisfying consumer requirements and facilitate trade relations on the basis of fair competition, thereby helping to make production more profitable.\n(4) The standards are applicable at all stages of marketing. Transport over a great distance, storage for a certain length of time or the various handling opeations to which the products are subjected may bring about deterioration due to the biological development of the products or their tendency to perish. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standards at the marketing stages which follow dispatch.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for fresh fruit and vegetables,", "main_body": ["The marketing standards for peas falling within CN code 0708 10 shall be as set out in the Annex.\nThe standard shall apply at all stages of marketing under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\nHowever, at stages following dispatch, the products may show, in relation to the provisions of the standards, a slight lack of freshness and turgitidy, and slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish.", "Annex I.3 to Regulation No 58 is hereby deleted.", "This Regulation shall enter into on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from the first day of the first month following the month of its entry into force.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 3 December 1999.\nFor the Commission\nFranz FISCHLER\nMember of the Commission\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 80.\n(3) OJ 56, 7.7.1962, p. 1606/62.\n(4) OJ L 126, 17.5.1997, p. 11.\nANNEX\nSTANDARD FOR PEAS\nI. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\nThis standard applies to shelling peas of varieties (cultivars) grown from Pisum sativum L. and peas intended for consumption in the pods or snow peas (mangetout peas) from Pisum sativum L. var. macrocarpon and sugar snap peas from Pisum sativum L. var. saccharatum to be supplied fresh to the consumer, peas for industrial processing being excluded.\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements for peas after preparation and packaging.\nA. Minimum requirements\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed,\n(i) the pods must be:\n- intact\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded\n- clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter (including parts of the flowers)\n- free from hard filaments or films in mange-tout peas\n- practically free from pests\n- practically free from damage caused by pests\n- free of abnormal external moisture\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\n(ii) the peas must be:\n- fresh\n- sound, i.e., free of damage caused by pests or diseases\n- normally developed.\nThe development and condition of peas must be such as to enable them:\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\nB. Classification\nPeas are classified in two classes defined below:\n(i) Class I\nPeas in this class must be of good quality.\nThe pods must be:\n- characteristic of the variety in shape, size and colouring\n- with peduncles attached\n- free from damage by hail\n- fresh and turgid\n- without damage caused by heating.\nFor mange-tout peas the pods may have:\n- very slight skin defects, injuries and bruises\n- very slight defects of shape\n- very slight defects of colouring.\nFor shelling peas:\nthe pods must be\n- well filled, containing at least five seeds.\nthe peas must be:\n- well formed\n- tender\n- succulent and sufficiently firm, i.e., when squeezed between two fingers they should become flat without disintegrating\n- at least half the full-grown size but not full grown\n- of the colour typical of the variety\n- non-farinaceous\n- undamaged.\nFor mange-tout peas, the peas if present must be small and underdeveloped.\n(ii) Class II\nThis class includes peas which do not qualify for inclusion in the Class I but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\nShelling peas may be riper than those in Class I.\nThe following slight defects may be allowed provided the peas retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation.\nFor mange-tout peas, the pods may have:\n- slight skin defects, injuries and bruises\n- slight defects in shape, including those due to the seed formation\n- slight defect in colouring\n- slight not-progressive skin defects caused by pests\n- slight drying, excluding wilted and uncoloured pods.\nFor shelling peas, the pods may have:\n- slight defect in colouring\n- slight damage provided it is not progressive and there is no risk of the seeds being affected\n- some loss of freshness, although wilted pods are excluded.\nThe pods must contain at least three seeds.\nThe peas may be:\n- less well formed\n- slightly less coloured\n- slightly harder\n- slightly damaged.\nOver-mature peas are excluded.\nIII.

PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\nTolerances in respect of quality shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\n(i) Class I\n10 % by weight of peas not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n(ii) Class II\n10 % by weight of peas satisfying neither the requirements of the class nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting, progressive diseases or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\nV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA. Uniformity\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and contain only peas of the same origin, variety and quality.\nThe visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.\nB.

Origin of produce\n- Country of origin and, optionally, district where grown, or national, regional or local place name.\nD. Commercial specifications\n- Class\nE. Official control mark (optional)"}
