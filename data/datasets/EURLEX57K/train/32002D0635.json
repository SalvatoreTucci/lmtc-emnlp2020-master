The surveillance programme confirmed with regard to the prevalence of glanders the findings of the mission carried out in 1998. A large number of mallein reactors identified amongst non-registered horses, mules and donkeys have been destroyed and compensated.\n(8) It appears therefore appropriate to allow temporary admission, re-entry after temporary export of Community registered horses and permanent imports of registered horses from those provinces in Turkey listed in Decision 92/160/EEC under the animal health conditions established for registered horses from areas of similar epidemiological situation. However, health tests required in accordance with the relevant conditions for imports shall be carried out in laboratories agreed by the Member State of destination.\n(9) Decisions 92/160/EEC, 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly and Decision 98/404/EC repealed.\n(10) Countries appearing in the list being identified according to the ISO alpha 2 codes used by the Community legislation for the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade, notably Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2000(16), the provisional status of such codes should be specified whenever appropriate.\n(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The words \"Turkey (2)\" in the Annex to Commission Decision 92/160/EEC are replaced by \"Turkey\".", "Commission Decision 92/260/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.
