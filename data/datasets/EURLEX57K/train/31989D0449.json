Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Destron PG 100' ('DEST').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 7 millimetres diameter containing a photodiode (type Texas SL 2018) and a photodetector (type Texas LS 608 D), having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y   // = 74,55756 - 4,86668 \u0e22\u0e07 x1 + x2 + 0,10119 x3\nwhere:\n1.2 // y   // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib,   // x2   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x3   // = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms.\nPART 2\nFat-O-Meater (FOM)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater' ('FOM').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 6 millimetres diameter containing a photodiode of the Siemens SFH 950 type and a photodetector (type SFH 960), having an operating distance of between 5 and 105 millimetres. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of a computer.\n3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y   // = 53,25734 + 2,31857 \u0e22\u0e07 x3 - 2,48915 \u0e22\u0e07 x1 - 0,50962 x2\nwhere:\n1.2 // y   // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib,   // x2   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x3   // = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms.\nPART 3\nHennessy Grading Probe (HGP)\n1. Grading of pig carcases shall be carried out by means of the apparatus termed 'Hennessy Grading Probe' ('HGP').\n2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a probe of 5,95 millimetres diameter (and of 6,3 millimetres at the blade at the top of the probe) containing a photodiode (Siemens LED of the type LYU 260-EO) and a photodetector (type Siemens 58 MR) and having an operating distance of between 0 and 120 millimetres. The results of the measurements are converted into estimated lean meat content by means of the HGP itself or a computer linked to it. 3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n1.2 // y   // = 57,6643 + 0,15179 x3 - 0,61704 x2 - 0,22135 x1\nwhere:\n1.2 // y   // = the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase,   // x1   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 8 centimetres off the midline of the carcase at the last rib,   // x2   // = the thickness of backfat (including rind) in millimetres, measures at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase, between the third and fourth last ribs,   // x3   // = the thickness of muscle in millimetres, measured at the same time and in the same place as x2.\nThe formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 50 and 120 kilograms."}
