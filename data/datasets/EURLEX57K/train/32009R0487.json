The Commission should be enabled to declare by way of regulation that the provisions of Article 81(1) of the Treaty do not apply to certain categories of agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices.\n(3) The Commission should be empowered to grant block exemptions in the air transport sector in respect of traffic within the Community, as well as in respect of traffic between the Community and third countries.\n(4) It should be laid down under what specific conditions and in what circumstances the Commission may exercise such powers in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States.\n(5) It is desirable, in particular, that block exemptions be granted for certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices.
