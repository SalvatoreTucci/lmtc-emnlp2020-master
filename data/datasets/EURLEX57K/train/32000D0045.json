Where appropriate, other test methods may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the competent body assessing the application.\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14 001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.)\nThese criteria aim in particular at promoting:\n- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption\n- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by reducing water consumption\n- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging recyclability\n- the reduction of water pollution by contributing to reduced detergent consumption, and\n- the reduction of noise emissions.\nThe criteria encourage the implementation of best practice and enhance consumer environmental awareness. Furthermore, marking the plastic components encourages the recycling of the machine.\nKEY CRITERIA\n1. Energy efficiency\nThe machine shall use less than or equal to 0,17 kWh of electrical energy per kg of washload measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Commission Directive 95/12/EC(1).\nThe applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of energy consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less or equal to the above requirement. The value declared on the energy label shall not be lower than this mean value, and the energy efficiency class indicated on the energy label shall correspond to this mean value.\nIn case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999.\n2. Water consumption\nThe machine shall use less than or equal to 12 litres of water per kg of washload measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.\nThe applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of water consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less or equal to the above requirement. The value declared on the energy label shall not be lower than this mean value.\nIn case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 6056:1999.\n3. Spin drying efficiency\nThe machine shall achieve a residual moisture content (also termed D or spin extraction) of less than 54 %, in an EN 60456:1999 test, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.\nThe machine will thus qualify for spin drying efficiency class A or B as defined in Directive 95/12/EC, Annex IV.\nThe applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of the spin extraction made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less than the above requirement. The spin drying efficiency class indicated on the energy label shall correspond to this mean value.\nIn case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 6056:1999.\n4. Noise\nAirborne acoustical noise from the appliance, counted as sound power, shall not exceed LWAd 56 dB(A) during washing or LWAd 76 dB(A) during spinning, measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.\nInformation about the noise level of the machine shall be provided in a way clearly visible to the consumer. This shall be done by the incorporation of this information in the energy label for washing machines.\nThe applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Commission Directive 95/12/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of noise made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 \u00b0C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC. The declared noise during washing and during spinning shall be derived from these measurements as laid down in the standards referred to in EN 60456:1999 (with the producer's risk a &lt;= 5 %), shall be less or equal to the above requirements, and shall appear on the energy label.\nIn case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999.\n5. Prevention of excessive use of detergent\nThe appliance shall have clear volumetric and/or weight-related markings on the detergent dispenser allowing the user to adjust the detergent quantity used according to the type and amount of load and its degree of soiling.\nThe applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with this requirement.\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA\n6. Appliance design\nThe machine shall have clear markings on it identifying the appropriate settings according to fabric type and laundry code.\nThe machine shall have clear markings on it identifying energy and water saving programmes and options.\nThe applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n7.
