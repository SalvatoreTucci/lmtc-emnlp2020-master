Those conditions are to be at least equivalent to those applicable to trade between Member States.\n(2) Directive 2009/156/EC lays down animal health conditions for the importation into the Union of live equidae. It provides that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from third countries which have been free from glanders for a period of six months.\n(3) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species, and amending Decisions 93/195/EEC and 94/63/EC\u00a0(3) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States are to authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision and includes registered horses and semen thereof from Lebanon.\n(4) The Regional Commission for the Middle East of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) informed the Commission of the confirmation by an OIE Reference Laboratory of glanders (Burkholderia mallei) cases in equidae in Lebanon.\n(5) The introduction into the Union from Lebanon of registered horses and of semen thereof should therefore no longer be authorised. Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the entry for Lebanon in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.\n(6) In April 2010, the Commission received a report about confirmed cases of glanders in the northern parts of Bahrain. In order to suspend the introduction into the Union of registered horses, their semen, ova and embryos, the Commission adopted Decision 2010/333/EU of 14 June 2010 amending Decision 2004/211/EC as regards the entries for Bahrain and Brazil in the list of third countries and parts thereof from which the introduction into the European Union of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species are authorised\u00a0(4).\n(7) A veterinary inspection mission carried out in Bahrain in June 2011 found sufficient evidence that Bahrain had implemented measures to control the disease in the north and that surveillance carried out throughout the territory of Bahrain confirmed the continued absence of this disease in the southern part of Bahrain. In addition, Bahrain has implemented movement controls, which include a strictly enforced ban on movements of equidae from the northern part of the territory of Bahrain into the southern part of the main island of Bahrain. Consequently, it is possible to regionalise Bahrain in order to authorise the temporary admission and imports into the Union of registered horses from the southern part of the main island of Bahrain.\n(8) Accordingly, it is necessary to amend the entry for Bahrain and to provide details of the delimitation of the southern part of the main island of Bahrain in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC is amended as follows:\n1. the entry for Lebanon is replaced by the following:\n\u2018LB Lebanon LB-0 Whole country E \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2019\n2. the entry for Bahrain is replaced by the following:\n\u2018BH Bahrain BH-0 Whole country E \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nBH-1 Southern part of the main island of Bahrain E X \u2014 X \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2019\n3.
