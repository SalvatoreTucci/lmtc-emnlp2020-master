Such data has been submitted by the applicant.\n(4) The European Food Safety Authority has evaluated the submitted data and concluded on 15 May 2013 that 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene is mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo and that therefore its use as flavouring substance raises a safety concern\u00a0(4).\n(5) Accordingly the use of 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene does not comply with the general conditions of use for flavourings set out in Article 4(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008. Consequently, that substance should be removed from the list without delay in order to protect human health.\n(6) The Commission should use the urgency procedure for the removal of a substance which raises a safety concern from the Union list.\n(7) Pursuant to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 flavouring substances not included in the Union list may be placed on the market as such and used in or on food until 22 October 2014. That transitional period should not apply to 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene.\n(8) Due to very low use levels and the low total amount that 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene has been added yearly to foods in the European Union, the presence of that substance in food does not raise immediate safety concerns. Therefore, taking into account also technical and economic reasons, transitional periods should be laid down to cover food containing the flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene, which has been placed on the market or dispatched from third countries for the Union, before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(9) Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The placing on the market of 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene as a flavouring substance and the use of that substance in or on foods shall be prohibited.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The placing on the market of food containing the flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene shall be prohibited.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The import of 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene as a flavouring substance and the import of food containing the flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene shall be prohibited.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of derogation to Article 2(2), foods containing the flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene which have been legally placed on the market before the date of entry into force of this Regulation may be marketed until their \u2018use by\u2019 date or their date of minimum durability.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2 shall not apply to consignments of food containing the flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene where the importer of such food can demonstrate that they have been dispatched from the third country concerned and were en route to the Union before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 June 2013.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJos\u00e9 Manuel BARROSO\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 34.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 1.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 267, 2.10.2012, p. 1.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0EFSA Journal 2013; 11(5):3227.\nANNEX\nIn Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008, the following entry for FL 15.024 is deleted:\n\u201815.024 3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene 2530-10-1 1051 11603   2 EFSA\u2019"}
