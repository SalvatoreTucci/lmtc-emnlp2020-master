In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n(6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.\n(7) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter\u00a0(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n(9) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Part XVI of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, and exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 20 February 2009.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 19 February 2009.\nFor the Commission\nHeinz ZOUREK\nDirector-General Enterprise and Industry\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 5.7.2005, p. 24.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 308, 25.11.2005, p. 1.\nANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 20 February 2009 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\u00a0(1)\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code Description Rate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds Other\nex\u00a00402\u00a010\u00a019 Powdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\u00a0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a) on exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n(b) on exportation of other goods\nex\u00a00402\u00a021\u00a019 Powdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\u00a0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a) where goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n(b) on exportation of other goods\nex\u00a00405\u00a010 Butter, with a fat content by weight of 82\u00a0% (PG 6):\n(a) where goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n(b) on exportation of goods of CN code 2106\u00a090\u00a098 containing 40\u00a0% or more by weight of milk fat\n(c) on exportation of other goods\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0The rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to\n(a) third countries: Andorra, the Holy See (Vatican City State), Liechtenstein, the United States of America and the goods listed in Tables I and II of Protocol 2 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation.\n(b) territories of EU Member States not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Ceuta, Melilla, the Communes of Livigno and Campione d\u2019Italia, Heligoland, Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.\n(c) European territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible and not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Gibraltar.\n(d) the destinations referred to in Article 36(1), Article 44(1) and Article 45(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (OJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 11)."}
