It is essential to ensure the continuity of Community policy for the promotion of gender equality in view of the objectives enshrined in Article\u00a013 of the Treaty.\n(4) It is necessary to extend the programmes for a one-year transitional period until a new multi-annual framework programme on the financing of actions in the employment and social field for the period 2007 to 2013 including a strand on gender equality is established.\n(5) Decision 2001/51/EC was based on Article\u00a013 of the Treaty. However, following the amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice, Article\u00a013(2) constitutes the specific legal basis for the adoption of Community incentive measures intended to contribute to the combating of discrimination.
