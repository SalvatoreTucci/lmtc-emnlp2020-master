The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 171/92 (3), extended this duty for a period not exceeding two months.\nB. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE\n(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the interested parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views on the findings.\n(3) The parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties and the definitive collection of the amount secured by way of a provisional duty. They were  also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.\n(4) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered and, where appropriate, the Commission's findings were modified to take account of them.\n(5) Due to the complexity of the procedure and the other reasons indicated in recital 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 2818/91, the investigation could not be concluded within the time period mentioned in Article 7 (9) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2433/88.\nC.
