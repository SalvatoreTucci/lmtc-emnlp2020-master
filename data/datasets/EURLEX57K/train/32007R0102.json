Furthermore, it explicitly called for an accurate and objective analysis of these issues to help develop and promote policy initiatives for more effective management of migration in Europe. The need for effective integration policies was stressed once again in the \u2018Hague Programme\u2019 adopted by the European Council in Brussels in November 2004.\n(2) As highlighted in the Commission's first Annual Report on Migration and Integration\u00a0(2) lack of access to employment has been identified as the greatest barrier to integration and, therefore, the most important political priority within national integration policies.\n(3) Consequently, a comprehensive and comparable set of data on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants is needed in order to monitor progress towards the common objectives of the European Employment Strategy and of the Social Inclusion Process.\n(4) The Commission proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2014 Progress\u00a0(3) \u2014 provides in Section 1, Employment, the financing of the relevant actions including statistical actions. The present Regulation should implement those actions.\n(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 384/2005 of 7 March 2005 adopting the programme of ad hoc modules, covering the years 2007 to 2009, for the labour force sample survey provided by Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98\u00a0(4) already included an ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants. The list of variables for this module should be defined before December 2006.\n(6) Regulation (EC) No 384/2005 also provides that implementation of the 2008 module will be conditional upon the results of feasibility studies to be finished before the end of 2005. Eurostat presented the results of these feasibility studies in the meeting of Directors of Social Statistics of Member States in September 2005. It has been concluded that Member States and Eurostat should proceed in the preparation of the module 2008.\n(7) For reasons of reliability and quality of the data to be provided, some variables described in the Annex to this Regulation should be optional for Member States with a small sample size for migrants.\n(8) There is a need to amend columns 19/20 of Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 430/2005 of 15 March 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community concerning the codification to be used for data transmission from 2006 onwards and the use of a sub-sample for the collection of data on structural variables\u00a0(5) in order to increase the relevance of the analysis of the labour market situation of migrants by obtaining information on the year of arrival in the host country and on age at the time of arrival, which remain two key explanatory variables for analysing the process of integration into the labour market.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee,", "main_body": ["The detailed list of variables to be collected in 2008 by the ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants shall be as set out in the Annex.", "Columns 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218 and 219 of the Annex shall be optional for the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.", "In Annex II, the text in columns 19/20 of Regulation (EC) No 430/2005 is replaced by the following text:\n\u2018YEARESID 19/20 YEARLY  Years of residence in this country Everybody\u2019\n00 Born in this Country\n01-99 Number of years of residence in this country\nBlank No answer", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 2 February 2007.\nFor the Commission\nJoaqu\u00edn ALMUNIA\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 77, 14.3.1998, p. 3.
