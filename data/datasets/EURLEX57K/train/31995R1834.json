Without prejudice to the special transitional measures laid down  in the Act of Accession, the measures provided for in Articles 35 and 39 of Regulation (EEC) No  822/87 shall not apply in Austria in the 1995/96 wine year.\n2.  However, notwithstanding paragraph 1, any legal or natural person or group of persons  processing grapes harvested in Austria shall be obliged to withdraw under supervision the  by-products of such processing. Such by-products shall present the minimum characteristics required  by Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88. The competent Austrian authorities shall adopt suitable national  measures to ensure the proper application of this measure.\n3.  Where the voluntary distillation measures laid down in Articles 38 and 42 of Regulation (EEC)  No 822/87 are initiated, the Commission shall, in establishing the quantities of wine concerned,  the prices and aids in Austria, take account of the impact of compulsory distillation on producers'  incomes in that Member State.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 September 1995.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 26 July 1995.\nFor the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission"}
