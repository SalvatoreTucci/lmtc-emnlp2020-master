Under the terms of the Agreement, the rules it lays down are to be complied with as soon as the contracts in question reach or surpass the amounts, hereinafter referred to as \u2018thresholds\u2019, set in the Agreement and expressed as special drawing rights.\n(2) Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC have as one of their objectives the goal of allowing the contracting entities and the contracting authorities which apply them to comply at the same time with the obligations laid down in the Agreement. To achieve this, the Commission must check the thresholds laid down by the Directives to which the Agreement relates and, where necessary, revise them upwards or downwards so as to ensure that they correspond to the euro equivalents, rounded down to the nearest thousand, of the thresholds set in the Agreement. The values of the thresholds under the Directives are not the same as the values of the thresholds under the Agreement, recalculated to cover the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005\u00a0(4). They should therefore be revised.\n(3) Furthermore, in Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC, in order to reduce the number of thresholds to be complied with, those thresholds which are independent of the Agreement have been aligned on those which result from it. It is therefore appropriate to revise them as well.\n(4) The amendments do not affect the national provisions implementing Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC starting from lower thresholds than the thresholds specified in the Directives.\n(5) Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC should therefore be modified accordingly,", "main_body": ["Directive 2004/17/EC is amended as follows:\n1.
