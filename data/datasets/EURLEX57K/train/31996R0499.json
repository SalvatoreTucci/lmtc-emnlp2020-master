whereas by virtue of those instruments the Community has undertaken to open, subject to certain conditions, from 1 January to 31 December each year Community tariff quotas at zero duty for a number of products originating in Iceland;\nWhereas the tariff quotas in question relate to an indefinite period and accordingly, for reasons of efficiency and in order to simplify implementation of the measures concerned, it appears appropriate to provide for the application of this Regulation to be placed on a multiannual footing;\nWhereas, for reasons of simplification, provision should be made to empower the Commission to give effect, following receipt of the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, to necessary amendments and technical adaptations of this Regulation arising from amendments to the combined nomenclature and Taric codes, extensions of tariff measures, necessary adaptations following the conclusion of protocols or exchanges of letters, amendments to this Regulation for the implementation of any other instrument in the framework of the abovementioned Agreement as well as adaptations of volume, periods and quota rates arising from decisions by the Council;\nWhereas all Community importers should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said quota and the duty rate laid down for the quota should be applied without interruption to all imports of the product in question into all Member States until the quota is exhausted, during the whole period of the validity of the agreements with Iceland;\nWhereas the decision for the opening, in execution of its international obligations, of tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reason why the Member States should not be authorized to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are being used up and inform the Member States accordingly,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1 January to 31 December of each year, the customs duties applicable to imports of the products originating in Iceland referred to in this Regulation shall be suspended within the limit of the Community tariff quotas shown for each product.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imports of fishery products shall not qualify for the tariff quotas unless the free-at-frontier price laid down in Article 22 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products\u00a0(4) is at least equal to any reference price which has been fixed by the Community for the products or categories of products in question.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of Protocol 3 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland defining the concept of originating products and setting out the arrangements for administrative cooperation, as last amended by Decision No 1/94 of the EC-Iceland Joint Committee\u00a0(5), shall apply.", "The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be administered by the Commission, which may take any appropriate administrative measures in order to ensure efficient administration.", "If an importer presents in a Member State a declaration of entry into free circulation including a request for preferential benefit for a product covered by this Regulation, and if this declaration is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member State concerned shall draw, from the quota volume by means of notification to the Commission, a quantity corresponding to those needs.\nThe requests for drawing, with an indication of the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be communicated to the Commission without delay.\nThe drawings are granted by the Commission on the basis of the date of acceptance of the declaration of entry into free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member States concerned, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn, it shall return them as soon as possible to the corresponding quota volume.\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota volume, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests.
