Furthermore, the Communities' financial interests in relation to the expenditure financed under Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 are protected by the relevant rules pertaining to the protection of those interests in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(3), Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)\u00a0(4), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities\u00a0(5) and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests\u00a0(6).\n(5) To ensure sound management of financial flows, in particular because the Member States themselves mobilise, in a first step, the funds to cover the expenditure referred to in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 before the Commission reimburses their expenditure on a biannual basis, the Member States should collect the relevant information concerning the expenditure and transmit it to the Commission together with the declaration of expenditure.\n(6) The Commission should reimburse Member States biannually on the basis of those declarations of expenditure and the supporting documents to that declaration.\n(7) To enable the Commission to make efficient use of information from the Member States, that information should be sent electronically.\n(8) To avoid the application of different exchange rates for aid paid to producer organisations in currencies other than the euro, on the one hand, and in the declaration of expenditure, on the other, Member States concerned should apply the same exchange rate in their declarations of expenditure as that used when making those payments to the beneficiaries. The exchange rates applicable must be laid down according to operative events as defined by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2000 establishing the operative events for the exchange rates to be applied when calculating certain amounts provided for by the mechanisms of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products\u00a0(7).\n(9) In order to provide a legal basis for the payments made in the first reference period, it is appropriate to apply this Regulation with retroactive effect as from 16 October 2006,", "main_body": ["Subject matter\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) of expenditure incurred by Member States under the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products.", "Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definition shall apply:\n\u2018Expenditure\u2019 means expenditure incurred by the Member States as referred to in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.", "Competent authority\nEach Member State shall designate its competent authority for the implementation of this Regulation and notify it to the Commission.", "Declarations of expenditure\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall draw up a declaration of expenditure in accordance with the model in the Annex.
