Pursuant to Article 1 of that Protocol, cooperation in the context of the Schengen acquis is to be conducted within the institutional and legal framework of the European Union and with respect for the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union and of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(4) It is therefore appropriate to set out in a Community act the procedure by which such implementing decisions should be taken.\n(5) Since the Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of border policy, reflecting the sensitivity of this area, in particular involving political relations with third countries, the Council reserves the right, during the transitional period of five years referred to in Article 67(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, to adopt, amend and update the detailed provisions and practical procedures referred to above by unanimity, pending a review by the Council of the conditions under which such implementing powers would be conferred on the Commission after the end of this transitional period.\n(6) Some of those provisions and procedures require confidential treatment in order to prevent risk of abuse.\n(7) It is also necessary to provide for a procedure whereby the members of the Council and the Commission are informed without delay of all amendments to those Annexes of the Common Manual which consist, in whole or in part, of lists of factual information which must be provided by each Member State in accordance with the rules which it currently applies, and which therefore do not fall to be adopted, amended or updated by an act of the Council.\n(8) Those elements of the Common Manual and the Annexes thereto which are not subject to amendment by either of the procedures provided in this Regulation and which do not correspond to any elements of the Common Consular Instructions on Visas for the Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts (hereinafter \"Common Consular Instructions\")(4) which may be amended pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 789/2001(5) shall be amended in accordance with the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(a) and Article 67 thereof.\n(9) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this instrument, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given the fact that this instrument is an act which aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 5 of the abovementioned Protocol applies,", "main_body": ["1.
