That area was previously considered to be free of Bonamia ostreae but can therefore no longer be regarded as free of that disease.\n(3) In addition, Ireland has submitted a request for an amendment to the list of zones in Ireland approved with regard to Bonamia ostreae in Decision 2002/300/EC, in order to make the geographical description of one of the areas affected by that disease more precise. Accordingly, the description \u2018Logmore, Belmullet\u2019 should be replaced by \u2018Loughmore, Blacksod Bay\u2019.\n(4) Decision 2002/300/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2002/300/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 24 October 2005.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 46, 19.2.1991, p. 1.
